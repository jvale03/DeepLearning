We present a lattice QCD study of this channel with I=,JP=+andm MeV.",0
"Finite-volume energies calculated across five charm quark masses consistently feature a positive energy shift with respect to non-interacting energies, indicating repulsive interaction at energies near threshold.",0
"These energies are used to compute the DD scattering amplitude using both the standard L uscher method and the recently proposed effective-field-theory-based approach in the plane-wave basis, which incorporates the long-range interactions and the left-hand cut.",0
"Both analyses render a small negative scattering length and the scattering amplitude that does not feature any poles in the energy region near the DD threshold, in line with LHCb results.",0
"This implies that the observed exotic hadron Tcchas isospin I= , while members of the I= triplet cc u d,cc u uandcc d dhave not been found experimentally.",0
"In this channel, Tccappears either as a virtual state pole [, , , ] or a resonance below threshold [, , ] at pion masses heavier than the physical value.",0
"Lattice studies of the I= 1DD channel are more scarce: Positive energy shifts, suggesting a repulsive nature of interaction, were found for finite-volume energies evaluated by CLQCD at m MeV [].",0
The corresponding solutions of the Schr odinger equation for the physical D-meson masses do not support the possibility of bound states with I= like all previous static studies [ ].,0
"[] that for doubly-heavy molecules, sectors with different heavy-quark masses cannot be related within the same heavy-flavor EFT.",0
"However, the potential for charged meson exchange in this contraction is allowed and is proportional to the isospin factor , where (i)is the Pauli matrix in the vertex i (DD )I| |(D D)I C2=( ;I= ;I=. To derive this, we used that the contribution of 3 3vanishes for contraction C2, see Appendix C for details.",0
We extract DD scattering amplitude at five values of the charm quark masses and find only very mild dependence on the charm quark mass for I= .,0
Our analogous study for I= indicated that Tcctransitions from a resonance to a virtual state as the charm quark mass is increased [].,0
The largest simulated heavy quarkmass maybe of relevance1for the channel bc u dthat is currently being investigated by LHCb.,0
"The second concern involves the L uscher method itself, as the recent studies have highlighted challenges for this method when dealing with energy levels below left-hand cuts [, ].",0
"Specifically, the chiral EFT approach relates scattering amplitudes with finite-volume energies across the entire energy region of interest, including along the left-hand cut.",0
"We adjust the contact interactions, which parameterize the unknown short-range physics, to best fit our finite-volume energy data.",0
The plane-wave formulation of the approach 1The reduced mass of the DD system for our Set in Table I is close to the reduced mass of the B Dsystem in Nature.,0
"In this work, it helps in disentangling the contributions from Sand P-wave scattering in DD channel appearing in the A2irrep in the P2= frame.",0
"In addition, we utilize the conventional L uscher-based finite-volume quantization conditions in the partial-wave basis, which are formally valid only above the left-hand cut.",0
"The present work investigates the system cc u dwith I= for five values of the charm quark masses, where the corresponding D( )meson masses and spin-averaged mass mD= (mD+3mD )/ are provided in Table I. Set corresponds to the charm quark mass closest to its physical value.",0

"are shifted upwards with respect to the corresponding noninteracting DD energies, in particular those associated with DD in the S-wave (from T+ 1andA2).",0
"On the other hand, the DD interaction in the P-wave seems very small, as indicated by the negligible shifts of the corresponding levels from A .",0
"All five charm quark masses exhibit similar features of the energy shifts, the only difference being that the DD andD D thresholds approach each other with increasing the heavy quark mass, as expected.",0
"The aim is to extract the scattering amplitude for the single-channel DD system with I= and orbital angular momenta = , in the energy region below the D D threshold T(J) pcot (J) ip, 2Ecm= (E2 P2)/2withE= E+Econ niand E=Elat Elat ni are presented to reduce the discretization errors, as argued in Ref.",0

"The variation in the heavy quark masses is reflected in the masses of DandD mesons, DD thresholds, reduced mass, the spin average mass m Dand their corresponding hopping parameter cfor the bare charm quark mass.",0
The orange symbols correspond to the analytically reconstructed energy levels from the chiral EFT approach including one-pion exchange for the cutoff = GeV. TABLE II.,0
"The analyzed total momenta Pand irreducible representations, together with the quantum numbers characterizing DD scattering ( J, l are displayed).",0
III B determines the lowenergy constants of the DD effective Hamiltonian from finite-volume energies based on the quantization condition in the plane-wave basis.,0
"Both approaches employ the same set of nine finitevolume energy levels, which are shown by green and blue circles in Fig. .",0
"We exclude the energy level, that has dominant overlap with the DD ( )|l=2interpolator, which is the first excited energy level in the T+ 1irrep and the large volume ensemble.",0
A. Scattering amplitude based on L uscher method L uscher-based quantization conditions relate the finite volume energies extracted from lattice simulations to the partial wave scattering amplitudes.,0
"Here, the parameter a(J) is the scattering length and r(J) the effective range which are tuned to ensure that quantization conditions are satisfied for all the considered energy levels at once.",0
"The two plots in this figure present fits accounting for partial-waves = and =, with a two-parameter ERE for = and a one-parameter (constant) ERE for = .",0
This is supported by the fact that the eigenstate with dominant overlap to operator ( DD ) =2inT+ 1irrep and NL= has a negligible energy shift.,0
The momentum dependence of pcot forDD scattering with I= and partial wave = at the closest-tophysical charm quark mass (set in Table I) is represented by the band.,0
"The circles represent the simulated finite volume spectra and the corresponding amplitudes are from L uscher s quantization condition, incorporating only the S-wave.",0
"By adjusting the low-energy constants accompaning contact interactions to achieve the best fit to the lattice FV energy levels, we compute the isovector DD scattering amplitude in the infinite volume.",0
"The infinite-volume scattering amplitude Tand the effective potential Vare related via the Lippmann-Schwinger equations (LSE), as illustrated in Fig. .",0
Graphical illustration of the Lippmann-Schwinger equations solved in the infinite-volume with the partial-wave projected effective potential truncated to a given order in the EFT expansion.,0
"where Vis the effective potential in FV, Jis the Jacobi determinant arising from the transformation between the box and the center-of-mass frames, see Ref.",0
"The hierarchy of the operators is based on the expansion parameter Q {p/ b, m / b}with pbeing a typical soft momentum scale, m the pion mass and bthe breakdown scale of the chiral expansion.",0
"When pandp are on shell ( p=p ) and m > M, the OPE and, consequently, the on-shell DD partial wave amplitudes exhibit the left-hand cut at imaginary values of the momentum.",0
"We note that in general, the OPE may also have a three-body cut, corresponding to the on shell DD state (for its effect on the Tccproperties at the physical pion mass, see Ref.",0
"It should be noticed that contrary to the contact potentials, where only the most relevant interactions contributing to the irreps T+ , A and A2 are included, no partial wave expansion and truncation is made for the OPE in our plane wave expansion method.",0
"To be more specific, the Greek indices either run from to accounting for the3S1and3D1partial waves, respectively, or = = for the3P0case.",0
The scattering length a0forDD scattering with I= and l= as a function of the heavy quark mass in terms of the spin average mass mD= (mD+ 3mD ).,0
"This appears as a result of the positive energy shifts in the isovector channel, which suggests a repulsive interaction, as opposed to the attractive nature in the isoscalar sector indicated by the negative energy shifts [, ].",0
"In the following, we present the results of the analysis of lattice energy levels ranging from slightly below the DD threshold to approximately MeV above it.",0
"The highest energy point (see the blue point at the highest energy in Figs. and ) corresponds to the first excited level in the T+ 1irrep at larger volume, as shown in Fig. .",0
"Current experiments also do not observe any hadron structure features in the DD final states consistent with an isovector Tcctetraquark, which is in line with our results.",0
"Furthermore, the S wave scattering amplitude also contains a resonance pole located even further from the threshold; see Table III for its position.",0
"Therefore, it is reassuring to note that neither the zero nor the pole in the scattering amplitude affect low-energy observables, such as the effective-range parameters, extracted near the DD threshold.",0
"If the ERE approach were applicable below the left-hand cut, the intersection ofpcot 0andipwould imply a bound state and, consequently, an additional energy level that is not observed in the simulation.",0
"Scattering length a0and the effective range r0for the DD system with I= for five values of the heavy quark mass, all at fixed m MeV. Results are based on chiral EFT with two different cutoffs and including or excluding one-pion exchange.",0
The pcot 0forDD scattering with I= and partial wave = extracted from the finite-volume energy levels (EFV) using the EFT approach without and with the one-pion exchange.,0
"The results are shown for the two cutoffs and the D-meson masses corresponding to set from Table I. Red bands represent real part of pcot 0from our -parameter fits to EFV, including the uncertainty.",0
(g) No reliable results for the P wave low-energy parameters can be extracted from the energy levels inA 1shown in Fig. .,0
"Indeed, while the lowest energy level (blue point) coincides with the noninteracting energy, offering no useful constraints, the green point corresponds to a high momentum ( MeV), which alone cannot constrain the low-energy parameters.",0
"Due to SU symmetry breaking, however, their masses are not identical, leading to a small but non-vanishing contribution.",0
"In conclusion, the Wick contractions C2plays a crucial role in distinguishing between isospins I= and , with contributions specifically arising from light-meson exchanges with isovector-vector quantum numbers.",0
"The extracted DD scattering amplitude near threshold indicates repulsion, with a small negative scattering length a0, which is almost independent of the charm quark mass.",0
"This implies there is likely no exotic hadron with these quantum numbers in this energy region, at least at the employed larger-than-physical light quark masses.",0
TheDD scattering amplitude with I= has been extracted from finite-volume lattice energy levels based on the plane wave approach combined with the effective field theory.,0
This suggests that contributions to DD scattering from light-meson exchanges with isovector-vector quantum numbers (such as the -meson exchange) could be significant for the doubly-charmed tetraquark channel.,0
Future lattice studies could incorporate analogous simulations across a range of light-quark masses and lattice spacings.,0

"We leverage daily rhythm data from Owaves, a day planner app, capturing selfreported timing records of many different outputs (Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Work, Love, Play, Relax, and Miscellaneous activity labels) from 1M+ activities across individuals longitudinally.",0
We employ multiple clustering and classification approaches to test the null hypothesis that chronotype classification is not meaningfully affected by the choice of activity used to generate the classification.,0
Here we compared eight different kinds of output from the same people who logged the time of different outputs in the Owaves calendar app.,0
"We directly measured resultant chronotype similarities by Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to test for related vs. random sorting across outputs, using two forms of clustering to ensure the results were not dependent on our choice of clustering algorithm.",0
"In both hierarchical clustering on raw data ( Fig. 2A) and K-means on principal component projections of the data ( Fig. 2B), ARIs were low for all crossoutput comparisons ( Fig. 2C,D ).",0
Both Hierarchical (A) and K-means (B) clustering (here showing the same example modalities as in Fig. ) confirm a substantial differences in sorting by different outputs.,0
"A key limitation that must be emphasized is our reliance on self-reported data from Owaves, which likely results in biases, such as over-reporting or under-reporting certain activities.",0
"Large, longitudinal, and multimodal data like those generated by Owaves are rare at present but likely to become more common.",0
"We received a dataset comprising over a million activity records from the Owaves team, specifically from users who had consented to participate in the research.",0
"Post-filtering, the dataset was reduced to , rows from individuals, accounting for % of the original, non-duplicated database.",0
We sorted users by median values of their startHourTime and midHourTime to generate the matrixes which we then colored by cell value to make Heatmaps for Figure .,0
"Clustering Analysis a. Data Preparation To analyze clustering patterns, the following metrics were calculated for each activity: duration, startHourtime, midHourtime.",0
"c. Hierarchical Clustering Data was normalized using the StandardScaler().fit_transform method, similar to the K-means approach.",0
"Hierarchical clustering was then performed using the Ward s method for linkage, available in the scipy library, which minimizes variance within clusters.",0
"Similarity Analysis of Clustering Techniques To determine the similarity between clusters obtained from different clustering techniques, we performed a similarity analysis using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) values for both the hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering results for each activity type. .",0
"If the ARI scores after randomization still remain relatively high, it suggests that the original clustering was not much better than random.",0
"On the other hand, if the ARI after randomization becomes close to , it suggests that the original clustering is meaningfully better than random assignment.",0
B. Calculate ARI against itself: First calculate the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of the clustering result compared to itself.,0
C. Progressively randomize the clustering: a. Implement a loop that randomly swaps the cluster labels of two users or points.,0

The analyzer a steampunk vision of electromechanical relays and ad hoc circuitry was built to solve differential equations (ironically one of Boole s main interests as a mathematician) and pioneered by the brother of Lord Kelvin (one of Boole s close friends).,0

"Feynman would later win a Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics, and become legendary for his originality, intuition, and goofy, homespun charm.",0
"His Nobel Prize-winning work made the leap from the quantum mechanics of point-like particles to spatially extended objects called fields , and thereby helped establish the framework of quantum field theory .",0
Perhaps his most famous contribution was a graphical technique called Feynman diagrams for approximating the probability that one set of particles will collide and transform into another set.,0

"In this context, JWST plays multiple important roles: first, it holds the potential to further improve the precision of lens models; second, it provides an entirely new means of verifying systematics in previous models that are based on other telescope data (namely HST); third, with its superior resolution and sensitivity it will be crucial to exploit the large number of systems about to be discovered, which will likely be fainter than the ones analyzed so far (Oguri & Marshall ); and fourth, the extended wavelength range will enhance the detection of the extended emission (arcs) from the quasar host galaxy, providing tighter constraints on the deflector s mass distribution.",0
Preliminary models place the physical size at 150pc located 2kpc from the center of the galaxy (assuming flat CDM cosmology with h = and m=).,0
"Among the simplifications, we work within the context of a power-law model and do not consider the mass sheet degeneracy.",0
"We also show that with JWST s superior resolution and sensitivity, the mass distribution of the satellite galaxy is better constrained than with HST.",0
"When necessary we adopt a standard flat CDM cosmology with H0= km s , ,m=, b=, although we note that this choice is irrelevant from the point of view of the comparison presented here, since lens modeling is done in angular coordinates.",0
"As light is deflected by gravitational fields, we can occasionally observe multiple rays of light traversing different paths yet originating from the same object.",0
"How our image is distorted is specified by the lens equation, = ( ), with the lensed position in the lens plane ( =( 1, 2)), position in the source plane ( =( 1, 2)), and the deflection angle ( ).",0
"First is the spatial path length the light must traverse, and second is the gravitational potential the light experiences along that path (via the Shapiro delay Shapiro ).",0

"Thankfully, neglecting MSD, the source position, , and the lens potentials at the image positions, ( i) and ( j), can be determined by accurately modeling the mass of the system in imaging data; that data we denote by dJWST.",0
"Internal mass sheet degeneracy Currently, the primary source of uncertainty in the Fermat potential and time-delay cosmography at large is the masssheet degeneracy (MSD) discussed in Falco et al.",0
"In summary, by adding an infinite sheet of mass with constant uniform surface density, one can find the exact same image positions given a different source position, size, and luminosity, completely changing the physical geometry of the system and its associated Fermat potential.",0
"More formally, the MSD is a multiplicative transform of the lens equation that yields the same image positions despite a linear source displacement and transformation of the convergence field, .",0
"As discussed in the introduction, this paper is concerned with information coming from the lens model itself, and therefore we can neglect the mass sheet transformation, keeping in mind that it needs to be considered when converting the inference from Fermat potential to H0..",0
"Multiplane lensing In addition, the observed time-delays will depend on any galaxy (or massive object) having a significant impact on the deflection of our source s light, and these need not be at the same redshift as our lens.",0
"In this generalized case, we must combine the angular diameter distances of the di fferent lens planes, which is done with the multi-plane lens equation (e.g., Blandford & Narayan ; Kovner ; Schneider et al. ; Collett & Auger ; McCully et al. ).",0
"Thankfully, for quadruply-imaged quasars, it very often holds that the mass in a single plane dominates the lensing e ffect Suyu et al. .",0
"We must take into account the additional focusing and defocusing that external mass causes, which modifies the measured time-delays (e.g., Seljak ).",0
This is equivalent to adding (or removing) an external sheet of mass in the lens plane to account for the focusing (or defocusing) from the mass unaccounted for in the lens plane.,0
"The approach typically taken includes estimating the mass along the LOS combined with the assumption that the deflector s mass profile drops to zero at large radii (e.g., Fassnacht et al.",0
Higher-order e ffects must be explicitly taken into account for perturbers that are extremely massive or particularly close to the lensing galaxy (McCully et al. ). .,0
"Mass density slope/time-delay degeneracy An additional degeneracy exists between the lensing galaxy s radial mass slope and the time-delay distance (e.g., Kochanek ; Treu & Koopmans ; Wucknitz ), even within the context of power-law models.",0
"First, thanks to JWST, we have imaging of the extended arcs that are barely noticeable in HST data (see Fig. ), whose modeling directly constrains the radial mass slope.",0

"I.e., obs, cen (r) M, where the observed convergence near the center of the deflector galaxy, obs, cen , allows us to de-project the velocity dispersion, , to the gravitational potential, (r).",0
"To this end, we employ the spherical Jeans equation, d l(r) r(r) dr+2 ani(r)l(r) r(r) r= l(r)d (r) dr, with the 3D luminosity density, l(r), the radial velocity dispersion, r(r), and the anisotropy parameter that relates rto the tangential velocity dispersion t.

"JWST NIRSpec data was also taken for WFI2033, which we plan on modeling for spatially resolved kinematics in future analyses, which will enable tight constraints for more general mass models of the deflector.",0
"Therefore, wide-field photometric data is needed for photometric redshift measurements, galaxy-star classification, and measurements of the stellar masses of all galaxies i< mag within a arcsec radius.",0
"First, wavelet regularization increases the population of suitable stars for PSF generation by reducing the influence of varying noise levels among the stars on the resulting PSF model.",0

"G3 lies significantly far ( ) from the lens as to not require modeling of its surface brightness profile, however G3 may have a flexion shift large enough to require direct modeling of the mass distribution.",0
"In the previous HST power-law models, H0LiCOW XII found the mass of the satellite X to be unconstrained by the imaging data, with an SIS Einstein radius of E=+ .",0
Flexion Models for time-delay cosmography feature higher-order corrections of the lens potential for any mass a ffecting the system that is not explicitly included in our lens models.,0
"The second order corrections for an external mass a ffect on the lensing potential is given by the external convergence correction (Sect. ), which changes the scale /magnification of the lensed image, and the external shear term (Sect. ), which results in a stretching of the lensed image.",0
"We also join the centers of the two S rsics describing the bulge and disk components of D. For both the satellite and G2, we bind the center of their mass profiles with their light profiles.",0
"This allows us to solve the lens equation to constrain six of the lens mass parameters, one for each of the independent, relative positions of the images.",0
"Our uncertainty in the data is given by the -D resampled Poisson, readout noise, and flat-field variance estimates summed in quadrature, which we then scale by the weight map to account for the drizzling procedure.",0
"We introduce a likelihood penalty for models where the main deflector s mass profile is significantly more elliptical than, ormisaligned with, its light profile, inspired by the approach of Schmidt et al. .",0
"We add a flat prior to ensure the axis ratio of the mass profile, qL, agrees within of the lens-light s axis ratio, qLL, ensuring that qLL qL<.",0
"Similarly, we enforce a constraint to ensure that the position angles of the mass profile, L, and the lens-light profile, LL, are aligned.",0
"Specifically, we penalize configurations where the angular di fference between these two position angles exceeds a certain threshold, which is a function of the mass profile s axis ratio, qL.",0
"This condition ensures that the mass and light profiles remain well-aligned, particularly for more elliptical systems where misalignment is less tolerable.",0
"To optimize the lens model, we first use a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to identify high-likelihood regions, then refine those solutions with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to fully map out the posterior distributions.",0
"Further, goodness-of-fit statistics on imaging data alone cannot distinguish models with diverging physical interpretations, as profiles can become masssheet transforms of each other (Sect. ).",0
"Satellite Constraints The PEMD models in H0LiCOW XII found satellite X to have mass consistent with zero, indicative of poor constraints from the HST-based data.",0
"In addition, their models found an o ffset between the mass and light centroids for the main deflector of ( pc, assuming flat CDM cosmology with h= and m=).",0
"The influence of satellite X (lying to the north-west) was proposed as a partial potential explanation, as the mass centroid was found to be south-east of the light.",0

"Among these, inflation has emerged as the most compelling framework [ ], and it now constitutes one of the key pillars of the standard cosmological model, CDM.",0
"According to the theory of inflation, quantum fluctuations during an early period of accelerated expansion give rise to initial perturbations, which evolve into the structures we see in the Universe today.",0
"The statistical properties of these fluctuations are encoded in the primordial power spectrum (PPS), making it a vital probe for understanding inflationary physics.",0
"These early perturbations are also imprinted on cosmological observables, with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) serving as a particularly powerful tool for studying the PPS.",0
"This is largely due to the CMB s high-precision measurements and its ability to probe a wide range of spatial scales, providing strong constraints on the physics of the early Universe [, ] The simplest models of inflation, particularly canonical single-field slow-roll models [], predict initial scalar1perturbations to be adiabatic and Gaussian.",0
"These fluctuations are fully described by a nearly scale-invariant PPS with amplitude Asand scale-dependence 1While inflation also predicts the generation of tensor perturbations, we only focus on scalar perturbations for the remainder of this work.",0
"However, more complex models of inflation predict deviations from near scale-invariance and can also lead to distinctive features in the PPS.",0
Constraining the shape of the PPS thus offers a unique possibility to constrain the dynamics of the early Universe and test different models of inflation.,0
Deviations from near-scale invariance can also be constrained by going beyond the standard Asandnsparametrization of the PPS.,0
"In addition, various studies have explored oscillatory features that might be superimposed on the standard nearly scale-invariant spectrum, which could arise from more complex inflationary models or early-Universe physics [ ].",0
"This approach allows for arbitrary shapes of the PPS, free from any assumptions about inflation, and thus facilitates the comparison with a variety of inflationary models.",0
"Other techniques include using inversion methods to directly solve the integral equations linking the PPS to cosmological observables (e.g., CMB anisotropies) using transfer functions [ ], Bayesian approaches leveraging probabilistic frameworks for PPS inference [ ], and deconvolution algorithms such as the Richardson-Lucy method iteratively correcting for the blurring effect of transfer functions, similar to image deblurring techniques [ ].",0

"In order to further assess the robustness of both the INSandNUTS-based results, we perform a series of consistency checks by varying key hyperparameters of each algorithm.",0
"As can be seen, our constraints on the PPS are prior-dominated at the largest scales (up to kmin ), which we attribute to cosmic variance and our use of a compressed lowlikelihood.",0
"Conclusions In this work, we present a novel, fully-differentiable pipeline to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum (PPS) generated from inflation.",0

"The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability.",0
"To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance.",0
"The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates.",0
"We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net.",0
"We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by % and the nuclear energy generation by %, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps.",0
Massive stars ( M M ) usually end their lives in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) events where the core of the star collapses to form a neutron star or a black hole releasing gravitational energy.,0
"This arises from the stiffness of the extensive set of fully-coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs)1governing stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, making it extremely challenging to evolve stellar models with large nuclear reaction networks beyond core carbon burning.",0
"As a result, studies of late burning stages in massive stars are often performed using small nuclear reaction networks containing around isotopes (e.g., Aguilera-Dena et al.",0
"iXiZi/Ai(where Xi,ZiandAiare the isotopes abundances, atomic number and mass number, respectively) similar to large nuclear reaction networks prior to the collapse.",0
"However, during advanced burning stages, the evolution of the core is highly impacted by weak reactions, which are not included in the small nuclear reaction networks.",0
"Moreover, the explosion is sensitive to the structure of the silicon and oxygen shell formed after the end of silicon burning (e.g., Ertl et al. ; Ott et al. ; 1A set of ODEs is considered stiff when the ratio of the largest to the smallest absolute eigenvalue of its Jacobian matrix is very large, indicating widely varying scales within the system.",0
"Computing the pre-supernova (SN) neutrino losses and hence neutrino flux received at Earth requires large nuclear reaction networks that include weak reactions as well (e.g., Patton et al. 2017a; Patton et al. 2017b; Kato et al. ).",0
"Therefore, various studies have developed methods to address the computational challenge associated with employing large nuclear reaction networks in stellar nucleosynthesis calculations.",0
"In this study, we employ neural networks, which are universal function approximators (e.g., Cybenko ), to address the computational challenges posed by nuclear burning in massive stars.",0
"We focus on silicon core burning and develop neural network-based emulators, hereafter will be referred to as Nuclear Neural Networks (NNNs), designed to replace the solver of the nucleosynthesis ODEs in stellar evolution and hydrodynamical codes, and carry out a proof-of-concept to asses their performance.",0
"NNNs take the logarithm of the temperature and density along with the isotopic composition of a burning region as input, and predict the new composition and energy generation in that region after a given timestep based on the datasets they were trained on.",0
"In Section we show the isotopic abundances, electron fraction and energy generation predictions of our NNNs and compare their performance to results obtained from nucleosynthesis calculations performed with a small nuclear reaction network at fixed temperatures and densities.",0
"We perform nucleosynthesis calculations with large isotope nuclear reaction networks at fixed temperatures and densities (Section ) corresponding to advanced burning stages in stars (Section ), and design neural networks (Section ) that produce machine learning models (Section ) capable of emulating these results.",0
"Integrating these models into stellar evolution codes will enable the evolution of massive stars with large nuclear reaction networks without the need of solving the nucleosynthesis equations, facilitating the production of reliable CCSN progenitors on a larger scale. .",0
"+X k,lrkl,i(T) , where XiandAiare the abundance and mass of isotope iin the nuclear reaction network, muis an atomic mass unit, and T are the temperature and density of the burning region, and rabis the conversion rate of isotopes ato isotope bper unit volume.",0
"Decoupling the evolution of the nuclear reaction network from the stellar structure equations allows us to follow compositional changes based on the nuclear physics input alone, i.e., without the effect of other physical uncertainties such as mixing induced by convection or rotation.",0
"Furthermore, it facilitates the ODE solving process at high temperatures anddensities that is extremely challenging otherwise due to the stiffness of the coupled structure and nucleosynthesis equations.",0
"To determine the relevant parameter space for emulation, we evolve massive stars with initial masses of MZAMS = M according to the test case 20M premstocore collapse ofmesa-r23., changing the nuclear reaction network.",0
"we present the temperature (top panel) and density (middle panel) tracks of stellar models evolved with the nuclear reaction networks mesa (orange curves) and mesa (purple curves), and a rotationally-induced chemically homogeneous evolution of a MZAMS = M black hole progenitor modeled using a nuclear reaction network of isotopes (light blue curves; from Gottlieb et al. ).",0
"We create datasets for training using two different nuclear reaction networks, mesa 80andmesa (see Appendix A), which are determined based on Farmer et al. and by examining the compositions resulting from networks with a different number of isotopes (see Appendix B).",0
"For each nuclear reaction network, we sample the temperatures and densities of each burning region logarithmically in the regimes .2K<T<.9K 2We note that the mesa test cases are designed to run rapidly by sacrificing physical and numerical accuracy.",0
"For training the nuclear neural networks (NNNs), we consider a range of parameters that correspond to the conditions encountered in stellar models.",0
"We show the time evolution of the central temperature (top panel), central density (middle panel) and timesteps taken by simulations (lower panel) of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses of MZAMS = M and a nuclear reaction networks composed of isotopes (orange; this paper) and isotopes (purple; this paper), from post oxygen core burning to collapse.",0
"However, we find that narrowing our parameter space by using typical composition from inner regions of massive star evolved with mesa results in NNNs with poor performance, as the broader coverage significantly enhance the generalizations ability of the NNN trained models.",0
"Using the parameters sampled by the methods above, we generate = 106different combinations of temperatures, densities and nuclear compositions for each nuclear network.",0
The dataset size was chosen based on experiments showing that further increasing the training dataset does not improve the loss values or the predictions for the parameters of interest (equations and ).,0
"The emulators are composed of an input layer that contains the temperature T(on a logarithmic scale), density (on a logarithmic scale) and initial composition {X}i, several hidden layers and an output layer that consists of the composition, normalized nuclear energy generation term enucand normalized neutrino-loss term after a given timestep.",0
"The input layer maps the initial conditions to a hidden layer of neurons, and from there they are mapped between the rest of the hidden layers with neurons each, until we obtain the composition and normalized energy terms predicted by the NNNs.",0
"For NNNs trained on datasets produced with the nuclear reaction network mesa 80and mesa , the total number of layers is Nlayers = and Nlayers = , respectively.",0
"+Zdt 0 dt , where qis the sum over the rest mass difference between reactants and products for all nuclear reactions per unit mass and nucis the nuclear energy generation per unit mass per unit time.",0
"The NNNs map the + Nisoinputs, where Nisois the number of isotopes in the nuclear reaction network, into a higher-dimensional representation, enabling the model to extract and identify underlying patterns.",0
"The optimal number of layers Nlayers varies between the two nuclear reaction networks: for NNNs with Niso= isotopes we find Nlayers = results in the best performance, whereas for Niso= we find Nlayers = is the most effective (see Fig.",0
We use the L1 loss function (Edgeworth ; Tibshirani ) on a logarithmic scale for the composition and on a linear scale for the normalized energy terms.,0
"Our choice of the loss function is motivated by the goal of accurately predicting small abundance values on a wide range of scales, as common for nuclear compositions.",0
We use the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba ) which is a scholastic gradient descent method for its adaptive learning rate properties.,0
"We chose a learning rate of 4based on preliminary experimentation, ensuring steady convergence without drastic fluctuations.",0
"In this Section, we present the predictions of the NNNs, and evaluate the errors in key quantities critical for late burning stages of massive stars and the generation of reliable core-collapase progenitors.",0
"We compare these uncertainties to those that result from using the small nuclear reaction network ap-prox21 cr60 plus co563(see Appendix A), which includes isotopes.",0
"We define the error in the predicted abundance of each isotope compared to the target abundance found by runningbbqwith a large nuclear reaction network ( mesa ormesa ) as Xi=|Xi,NNN Xi,target|, where Xi,NNN is the abundance of an isotope predicted by the NNN and Xi,target is the target value the NNN is trying to predict, and average over the errors in our entire test dataset Xi= Xi = NtestNtestX j=|Xi,NNN,j Xi,target ,j|.",0

"3We use approx21 cr60 plus co56 for the comparison, which is the standard approx21 nuclear reaction network with the addition of 56Co and the replacement of56Cr with60Cr, since it was designed to better match the central Yevalues produced by large nuclear reaction networks.",0

"; purple pluses) and by % for mesa (top panel of Fig. ; orange pluses).For the energy terms, the small net errors are large, since it does not account for weak nuclear reactions at advanced burning stages.",0
"In the case of the nuclear energy generation term enuc(middle panel of Fig. ), the small net errors are very high throughout silicon core burning, reaching % error.",0
"Improvement in the results using Nuclear Neural Networks (NNNs) compared to the small nuclear reaction network, obtained by dividing the small net error by the NNN error and converting the result to a percentage.",0
"The top, middle and bottom panels present the percentage of improvement in the values of the electron fraction Ye, nuclear energy generation term enucand neutrino-loss term , respectively.",0
"In the case of the neutrino-loss term (bottom panel of Fig. ), the behavior of the error is similar for both nuclear reaction networks.",0
"We note that since the NNNs emulate the results of bbq and have no information on the underlying nuclear physics of the system, the sum of the nuclear and neutrino energy densities predicted by the NNNs will not amount to the sum over the rest mass difference between reactants and products for all nuclear reactions.",0
"Therefore, it is necessary to train the NNNs to predict both enucand for given initial conditions, rather than predicting one and inferring the other from equation .",0
"Examining the NNN predictions of the compositions, we find that while in the best cases they yield the exact same abundances as obtained with the large nuclear reaction networks for most of the isotopes, the worst predictions give compositions completely unrelated to the target values.",0
"TO STELLAR EVOLUTION MODELING Building on this proof-of-concept, the next step would be to integrate the NNNs into a stellar evolution code and assess their performance in full stellar evolution simulations.",0
Replacing accurate ODE solvers with NNN trained models has the potential to significantly accelerate modeling of massive stars.,0
"compares the time required to produce the testing datasets with bbq using a nuclear reaction networks with (empty orange squares) and (empty purple squares) isotopes, to the time it takes the NNN trained models to predict the compositions and energy terms of these datasets (filled orange circles for NNNs trained on mesa 80datasets and filled purple circles for NNNs trained on mesa datasets) for the range of timesteps we explored in this study.",0
The addition of more isotopes (and consequently more ODEs and terms in each equation; see equation ) significantly increases the time required by bbq to Figure .,0

"Overall, we can see that in the case of mesa 80NNN is more efficient than bbq in finding the composition and energy terms by a factor of -, and for mesa the efficiency grows by in favor of NNNs (without accounting for the one-time computational cost of generating the training sets).",0
"Comparing to the time required to produce the same bbq test sets with the small, isotopes nuclear reaction network (blue empty squares), we find NNNs are still times faster.",0
"Since in late stages of modeling massive stars nuclear burning takes the vast majority of computational time, implementing NNNs in stellar evolution codes could significantly reduce the computation time needed to evolve models with large nuclear reaction networks.",0
"In particular, this will be of crucial importance for multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations of SN explosions, which typically rely on stellar evolution mod-els with small nuclear reaction networks as their starting point (e.g., Fields ; Fujibayashi et al.",0
"Furthermore, the models trained on small timesteps could be useful in emulating nucleosynthesis during the explosion itself, though might require larger nuclear reaction networks.",0
"While covering the parameter space regime of the most common CCSN and black hole progenitors (see Fig. ), we note that lower mass stars that explode in electron capture SNe4have lower central temperatures throughout the final stages of their evolution (e.g., Wang et al. ), and higher mass stars that undergo pulsational pair instability SNe typically exhibit lower central densities (e.g., Woosley ; Renzo et al. ).",0
"They would be used only for burning regions with parameters within the training 4We note that modeling electron capture SNe requires large nuclear reaction networks with an extensive net of weak reactoins (see e.g., Jones et al. ).",0
"It is essential to train models on additional timesteps and nuclear physics input, as well as conduct parallel tests alongside accurate solvers and assess the accumulation of NNN errors over multiple timesteps.",0
", these tests should evaluate how well energy is conserved in the stellar model, as NNNs emulate the energy terms without explicitly enforcing thermodynamic consistency.",0
Other important uncertainties concerning nucleosynthesis in massive stars are currently overlooked by stellar evolution codes.,0
"The overall uncertainty in the measurement of reaction rates (see Fan et al. and Smith et al. for frameworks designed to explore nuclear reaction networks uncertainty) would have a great influence on stellar evolution outcomes (e.g., Fields et al. ).",0
"Another example is the contribution of excited states in out of equilibrium nuclei to nuclear energy generation (e.g., Misch & Mumpower ) and neutrino energies (e.g., Farag et al.",0

Empty orange (purple) squares represent the time it takes bbq solving the nucleosynthesis ODEs for all test datasets ( output files) with a nuclear reaction network that consists of isotopes.,0
In this study we developed neural network-based emulators (Section ) and conducted a proof-of-concept to evaluate their ability to predict the composition and energy generation during late burning stages of massive stars (Section ) to lay the ground work for future integration into stellar evolution codes (Section ).,0
"The large number of isotopes required to accurately model nuclear burning presents a significant numerical challenge, limiting our ability to study these evolutionary stages and to produce reliable progenitor models for CCSN simulations.",0
"To overcome this, we designed neural networks and trained them on datasets produced using the nuclear module of the stellar evolution code mesa , accessed through the wrapper bbq.",0

"We usedPyTorch lightning to design NNNs that receive the temperature (on a logarithmic scale), density (on a logarithmic scale) and composition (on a linear scale) of a burning region as input, map them through multiple hidden layers, and output the updated composition, normalized nuclear energy generation term, and normalized neutrino-loss term after a given timestep (Fig. ).",0
"% (top panels of Fig. ), which is % higher than the accuracy obtained with the commonly used small nuclear reaction network (top panel of Fig. ).",0
"As the electron fraction is crucial in determining the explodability of massive stars, an improvement in several factors could result in a different outcome that better reflects reality.",0
"Examining the nuclear energy generation rate for datasets produced with and isotopes, we found that across all explored timesteps the NNNs produced errors at least half the size of those from the smaller network (middle panels of Figs. and ).",0
"and show that the NNNs perform % better than the small net for short timesteps, while resulting in comparable and larger errors for dt s. Comparing between the typical times for obtaining the compositions and energy generation terms by solving the nucleosynthesis ODEs with bbq and predicting them with our NNN trained models, we found that NNNs have the potential of accelerating stellar evolution simulations performed with large nuclear reactionnetworks by a factor of (Fig. ), making them a promising tool for generating more reliable CCSN progenitors on larger scales.",0
"Before integrating them into stellar evolution simulations, however, it is important to asses the accumulation of NNN errors throughout silicon core burning, and to compare the improvement in their results with respect to the commonly used small nuclear reaction networks and other nuclear physics uncertainties.",0

"It is designed to obtain central electron fractions that match more closely the results from larger networks B.A BUG IN SOME LARGE NUCLEAR REACTION NETWORKS IN MESA To find the minimum size of the nuclear reaction network required to give accurate enough values of the composition and electron fraction, and identify the most suitable network for generating the NNNs training sets, we examined the compositions from bbqruns using networks of varying sizes: , , , , , , , , , and isotopes at different timesteps.",0
From comparing the lists of isotopes between the different nuclear reaction networks we concluded that the presence of tritium in the medium nets (and its absence in the smaller and larger nets) led to this prominent difference in the equilibrium compositions.,0
"Specifically, we tracked down the difference to the following reaction n + n + He4+ He4 h3+ Li7, (B1) which was unexpected given that the probability of a four-particle reaction is typically negligible.",0

"Finally, in the very high energy (VHE, > GeV) gamma-ray band, the advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA, Cherenkov Telescope Array Consortium et al. ) will o ffer unprecedented opportunities to detect transient emission associated with the most extreme astrophysical events.",0
"Additionally, we also investigate the impact of the mass distribution and the NS EoS on the NSNS results, as well as the e ffects of the NS EoS and the BH spin on the BHNS outcomes.",0
"The NSNS population was the same as assumed in Colombo et al. , in which the mass distribution was calibrated with current observational data from GW detections and Galactic NSNS systems (see Figure A.).",0
"To analyze how the NSNS mass distribution impacts our results, we also considered two variations: a Gaussian and a uniform mass distribution (see also Schwab et al.",0
The Gaussian has a mean value of M with standard deviation of M and it is based on the masses of galactic NSNS binaries ( zel et al. ; zel & Freire ).,0
"The SFHo EoS predicts a maximum non-rotating NS mass of MTOV= M and a radius of R1.= km for a M NS, while the DD2 has MTOV= M andR1.= km.",0
"Hereafter, we call fiducial the NSNS population constructed adopting the mass distribution from Colombo et al. and the SFHo EoS, treating the other combinations of mass distributions and EoS as variations over this fiducial model.",0
"Specifically, we relied on the BH and NS mass distributions from the standard parameter set (model A) detailed in Broekgaarden et al. .",0
"This results in a BH mass distribution that extends into the lower mass gap, particularly with BHs having masses below M .",0
"Prior to GW observations, the existence of such low-mass BHs was widely debated, largely due to X-ray binary observations in the Milky Way, which suggested a sharp cuto ffat around M for BH masses ( zel et al.",0
"These waveform models depend on several parameters, including the detector-frame chirp mass, mass ratio, dimensionless spin parameters of the binary components, luminosity distance, sky position, binary inclination angle, polarization angle, time and phase of coalescence, and the NS tidal deformability (Iacovelli et al. 2022b).",0
"The sky localization areas are computed within the Fisher-information-matrix formalism, valid in the high-S /N limit, in which the GW likelihood is approximated as a multivariate Gaussian near the peak (see e.g. Vallisneri for a comprehensive discussion of the formalism and its limitations).",0
"A detailed description of how ejecta masses and velocities, and accretion disk masses are estimated for NSNS and BHNS systems using analytical formulae informed by numerical relativity is provided in these previous studies.",0
"In brief, this model adopts a simplified description of the emissivity obtained from a delta function approximation of the average single-particle spectrum.",0
"Our methodology, which is similar to that in Salafia et al. , assumes that a constant fraction of the jet energy density, restricted to regions with a bulk Lorentz factor , is emitted in the form of photons.",0
We also decreased the parameter that sets the e fficiency of conversion of disk mass into jet energy (indicated with the symbol in equation B1 of Colombo et al. ) by a factor .,0
"For NSNS systems observed within a viewing angle v , we also included a cocoon shock breakout component, modeled following the characteristics of GRB 170817A (Abbott et al. 2017d), namely a luminosity LSB=1047erg/s and a cut-o ffpower-law spectrum with F peak photon energy Ep,SB= keV and low-energy photon index = .",0
This relatively stringent S /N threshold also enhances the reliability ofthe parameter estimation forecasts based on the GWFAST Fisherinformation-matrix (Iacovelli et al. 2022a).,0
"In our fiducial population, only about % of the mergers produce some mass remnant ( mout>), potentially powering an EM counterpart.",0
"The GRB prompt horizon is smaller than the GW one: this occurs because only events with low BH masses, and hence an intrinsically fainter GW signal, lead to a NS disruption outside of the BH ISCO.",0
"Consequently, the combined GW +GRB detection horizon is defined by the GW detection of events involving BHs below a specific mass threshold.",0
"The di fferent markers represent di fferent mass distribution choices: triangles denote the fiducial distribution used in Figure , while squares and circles represent a Gaussian distribution centered at with a standard deviation of , and a uniform distribution between and MTOV, respectively.",0
"Regarding GW detections, represented by black markers, we observe an increase in detection rates as we move from the Gaussian distribution to the fiducial and uniform distributions, which correspond to more massive NSs on average.",0
"For KN +GW detections (blue symbols), the only noticeable effect is an increase in the horizon, from z90% toz90% , when assuming the uniform mass distribution, due to an increased fraction of events with a massive accretion disc, whose winds produce a strong KN emission.",0
Di fferent marker shapes indicate di fferent adopted mass distributions (triangle: fiducial; square: uniform; circle: Gaussian).,0
"For the SFHo EoS (filled symbols), the rates do not di ffer appreciably between the Gaussian and fiducial mass distributions, but they increase when assuming the uniform distribution, due to the increased fraction of events with massive accretion discs (see Figure A. for a comparison between mass distribution and ejecta and accretion disc masses).",0
"Therefore, when assuming DD2, the fiducial and Gaussian distributions mostly produce supramassive or stable NS remnants, leading to a reduced jet production rate (see Figure A., where the HMNS formation condition is indicated by a pink line).",0
"The variations in the mass distribution and EoS naturally alter the fluence distribution, preventing a match with SGRB observations unless the jet and prompt emission models are adjusted.",0
"In this case, no variations in the mass distribution were considered: this is because we find that most of the mass distribution di fferences in the model variations explored in Broekgaarden et al. appear at high BH masses, while the mass range relevant for EM emission changes only slightly.",0
"The only exception is for models that assume the rapid SN model from Fryer et al. , but the support for that particular model, which produces a gap below M in the distribution of BH masses in binaries, has weakened in the last years, especially because of GW observations of objects that fall in such mass gap (Abac et al. ).",0
"This is due both to the change in the EoS where DD2 leads to more deformable NSs and, consequently, larger ejecta masses and to the inclusion of the more optimistic spin assumption, which increases the fraction of events capable of producing an EM counterpart (see Figure A. for a comparison of the mass distribution with the ejecta and accretion disc masses).",0
"In Figure , we present the distribution of rest-frame spectral energy distribution (SED) peak energy Epeakversus isotropicequivalent energy Eisofor NSNS (left-hand panel) and BHNS (right-hand panel) events that meet our detection criteria for both the GW signal and the GRB prompt emission.",0
Rest-frame SED peak photon energy Epeakversus the isotropic-equivalent energy Eisofor our NSNS (left panel) and BHNS (right panel) populations.,0
"For BHNS mergers, our results are less optimistic: in fact, only a small fraction of these events are expected to generate EM emission, primarily because tidal disruption of the NS occurs outside of the BH ISCO only under favorable conditions, such as low black hole mass, high BH spin, and large NS deformability.",0
"The fraction of reasonably well localized events increases by a factor of around four with a network of two L-shaped ET detectors, while a much more drastic improvement comes when considering ET in tandem with two CE detectors, bringing the fraction of well localized events (for which a multi-wavelength follow-up can be realized with conceivable resources) up to more than % of the detected sources.",0
"We examined the impact of variations in the NS EoS, BH spin distribution, and mass distributions on our detection rates.",0
"For NSNS systems, the primary source of error in the detection rates is the uncertainty in the local merger rate, while variations in the mass distribution and EoS generally result in smaller deviations, except in certain cases involving GRB emission, due to the specific conditions assumed for the launch of relativistic jets.",0

We analyze the m and m phase curve properties and find a strong wavelength-dependent difference in how the properties correlate with physical parameters as well as evidence that the phase curve properties are determined by multiple physical parameters.,0
"Taken together, the observed phase curve behavior suggests that different physical processes are responsible for establishing the thermal phase curve at different pressures, which are probed by different wavelengths, and that further 3D GCM modeling is required to investigate the reason for this complex dependence on planetary properties.",0
Thermal emission is highly sensitive to both the temperature profile and the vertically integrated column abundances and thus it is highly desirable to have phase curve measurements at multiple wavelengths (Heng & Showman ; Showman et al. ; Zhang ).,0
"The full planet parameters table available online includes values for radius, mass, log(g), equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, period, time of mid-transit, inclination, eccentricity, omega, impact parameter, transit duration, and transit depth.",0
"If we were observing over all wavelengths, the flux term would converge to T4, where is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant and Tis the black-body temperature.",0
"However, channels and of Spitzer IRAC are each roughly micron wide, therefore the flux is estimated by integrating a blackbody function, B , over the respective wavelength range like such: Swain et al. -. . . . . .",0
"The contours represent different sigma levels (orange = >, green , and blue <) where the median and standard deviation of the distribution are reported in the title of each diagonal plot.",0
"The thermal phase curve of an exoplanet represents the variation in observed flux as a function of orbital phase, primarily due to the changing viewing geometryof the planet s day and night sides.",0
The retrieved parameters values and uncertainties (see Figure ) are derived from posterior distributions using a nested sampling algorithm.,0
A nested sampling algorithm is efficient at probing parameter spaces which could potentially contain multiple modes and pronounced degeneracies in high dimensions; a regime in which the convergence for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow (Skilling ; Feroz & Hobson ; Feroz et al. ).,0
"The algorithm s efficiency is due to iteratively exploring smaller and smaller portions of a prior parameter space with sampling constraints being updated by local likelihood values (i.e., sample unlikely areas in a sparse manner and vice versa).",0
"None-the-less we monitor and quantify the quality of the instrument model by removing our determination of the astrophysical signature and then using three diagnostics contained in the Residual Statistics plots: light curves before and after application of an instrument model, histogram of residuals before and after application of an instrument model, and the power spectral density (PSD) of the light curve before and after application of the instrument model (see Figure ).",0
The observations for targets in this catalog vary substantially in terms of level of systematics (as seen in the range of shapes of the blue data in the Residual Statistics diagnostic plots).,0
"By applying the Residual Statistics diagnostics across the catalog, we find that the instrument model produces residual light curves that are flat and visually free of artifacts, Gaussian-like residuals typically around times the photon noise, and PSDs that are flat.",0
"The parameters Rp/Rs,Fp/Fs,C1, and C2(see Equations , , and ) are the parameters that determine the observed properties of the phase curve.",0

"using this new method, which relies on a joint analysis of the kSZ and -point functions (Alvarez et al. ; Ferraro & Smith ).11This forecast is within a factor of two of the cosmic-variance-limited error bar from the large-scale E-mode polarization targeted by satellite missions such as LiteBIRD (LiteBIRD Collaboration et al. ).",0
"Using the unique redshift independence of the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect, SO will extend tSZ cluster detection into the epoch in which the first massive, virialized structures formed atz .",0
"Thermal SZ surveys from ACT, SPT, and Planck have led the field in constructing clean, complete, nearly mass-selected cluster samples, with the latest catalogs comprising several thousand galaxy clusters in total (Hilton et al. ; Planck Collaboration ; SPT, DES Collaboration ).",0
"SO will thus provide the community with a homogeneous, well-defined catalog for follow-up studies out to high redshifts, with clusters in the unique z > discovery space (Mantz et al. ), enabling a broad range of multiwavelength science, including X-ray analyses with eROSITA (Merloni et al. ).",0
Mass estimates will be enabled by galaxy weak lensing data from Rubin and Euclid for clusters at z and by SO s own CMB lensing data at higher redshifts.,0
"12The exact pressure profile parameters used are: P0= , c= , = , = , and = , with a hydrostatic mass bias b= used to set the normalization of the pressure mass relation.",0
"Relativistic tSZ measurements will yield simultaneous inference of the electron pressure and temperature (and hence density) in massive halos, thereby allowing new approaches to cluster mass estimation and novel constraints on intracluster medium physics, particularly in combination with X-ray data (see, e.g., Mroczkowski et al. , for a review).",0
"Both frequencies will yield a similar number of detections at the baseline noise, and both flux measurements help to constrain the spectral energy distribution of these galaxies.",0
"The possibility thus arises that deeper observations, reaching sensitivities below the CIB confusion limit, could be undertaken in sub-regions of the LAT survey, which would allow techniques such as probability of deflection approaches (P(D); e.g., Glenn et al. ) to set constraints on the CIB population beyond the confusion limit.",0
"Aside from measuring flaring events and stochastic variability, these data can be used to search for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) which are expected to have sinusoidal light curves.",0
"The low-energy bump (Urry ), spanning the radio to UV, peaks in the millimeter and is due to synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons.",0
"The emission mechanism behind the high-energy bump, which spans the UV to gamma-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, is still under debate.",0
"Its origin is either leptonic, inverse-Compton scattering of lower energy photons (Dermer & Schlickeiser ; Maraschi et al. ), or hadronic, proton-synchrotron radiation or photo-pion production (Dermer & Atoyan ; M ucke & Protheroe ).",0
Cross-correlating blazar light curves over a range of wavelengths can elucidate the physical processes that shape and change blazar SEDs.,0
"However, few of these studies have included millimeter-wavelength light curves (e.g., Hood et al. ), even though millimeter-wavelength emission is a strong indicator of synchrotron radiation.",0
"Insights into the polarized Galactic interstellar medium Arcminute-resolution millimeter-wave maps of the SO footprint, which includes much of the Galactic plane, will be valuable for answering many questions about the physical mechanisms responsible for polarized Galactic emission, via measurements of the dust and synchrotron spectral energy distributions, and detections or upper limits on polarized CO line emission and anomalous microwave emission (Hensley et al. ).",0
"Recent ACT observations of the Galactic center (Fig. ; Guan et al. ) offer a glimpse of the physical processes probed at SO frequencies, which will complement multiwavelength observations (e.g., Butterfield et al. ; Heywood et al. ).",0
"These models predict a strong divergence of the dust total intensity and polarization spectra i.e., a wavelength-dependent polarization fraction in the frequency range probed by SO.",0
"However, analyses of data from Planck and the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for Polarimetry (BLASTPol) find that the difference in spectral indices between dust total intensity and polarization at submillimeter wavelengths is only on the order of a few percent at most (Ashton et al. ; Planck Collaboration et al. 2020c; Shariff et al. ).",0
"Using sky models from the Python Sky Model (Thorne et al. ), we forecast that SO measurements combined with Planck andWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP ) data will measure dustto ( dust) = ., sufficient to test the two-component dust model (Hensley et al. ).",0
"Solar system bodies and exo-Oort clouds Reflected sunlight from objects falls off rapidly with distance from the Sun, so the strongest limits on massive outer Solar System objects come from their intrinsic thermal emission.",0
"The strongest bounds on unknown giant planets are set by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE ), excluding planets more massive than Saturn closer than , AU (Luhman ).",0
"The spectra of smaller, faster-cooling planets peak at longer wavelengths, well suited for millimeter observations (see Naess et al. (2021a) for details on the model assumed here).",0
"Observations of asteroids at millimeter wavelengths have shown a consistent deficit in flux as compared to expectations from the infrared (e.g., Johnston et al. ; Webster et al. ).",0
"With the new generation of CMB experiments, however, it has become possible to make catalogs of asteroid flux in the millimeter.",0
"Both experiments found a systematic flux deficit in the millimeter, with Orlowski-Scherer et al. finding a spectral shape to the deficit wherein the deficit was more severe at and GHz than at GHz.",0
"Typically, the millimeter emission is synchrotron radiation produced by particles accelerated as a shock plows into an ambient medium.",0
"For decades, observations at centimeter wavelengths have been used to study the explosion and environment properties of explosive phenomena such as supernovae (SNe; e.g., Weiler et al. ), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; e.g., Chandra & Frail ), tidal disruption events (TDEs; e.g., Alexander et al. ), and novae (e.g., Chomiuk et al. ).",0
"Whitehorn et al. ), and these data have also been used to put millimeter-wavelength flux limits on known extragalactic transients (Herv as-Caimapo et al. 2024b).",0
"Growing evidence suggests that some massive stars shed a significant fraction of their mass in the final stages of their lives (Smith ), perhaps due to vigorous convection in the late stages of nuclear burning (Quataert & Shiode ; Shiode & Quataert ) or binary interaction (e.g., commonenvelope evolution; Chevalier ).",0
"Another important class of extragalactic transients is long-duration GRBs (LGRBs), produced in the powerful jets launched by collapsing massive stars (Piran ).",0
"Liang et al. ; Nakar ), which are a potential site of high-energy neutrinos (Murase et al. ) and cosmic rays (Zhang et al. ); and (iii) looking for dirty fireballs (Dermer et al. ), i.e., jets with lower initial Lorentz factors than classical GRBs.",0
"SO has the potential to conduct the most sensitive, unbiased survey of millimeter-wave reverse-shock emission over half the sky.",0
"In addition, millimeter observations are sensitive to outflows with lower energies than centimeter-wavelength observations (Alexander et al. ).",0
"In the framework typically applied to model supernova centimeter-wave observations, the electrons are presumed to be accelerated into a power-law energy distribution (e.g., Chevalier ).",0
"and AT2020xnd (Perley et al. ) show evidence for a separate emission component at millimeter wavelengths ( GHz) that does not fit the standard model used to describe the late-time low-frequency ( < GHz) data (Ho et al. , ; Margutti et al. ).",0
"For ordinary SNe we use an observationally constrained rate (Li et al. ; Perley et al. ), and luminosities of the handful of events detected at millimeter wavelengths to date (Berger et al. ).",0
"ACT also recently reported an observation of a classical nova (Biermann et al. ), one of only a few observations of nova outbursts at millimeter wavelengths (Chomiuk et al.",0
"Several wide-field surveys will cover the entire sky to a depth comparable to 2MASS (Moore & Kasliwal ), including WINTER (Lourie et al. ).",0
"SO adds an important dimension to these complementary experiments with its sensitivity to polarization, which is a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between different classes of sources.",0
"In addition to the new detectors, the planned infrastructure also includes a new photovoltaic power system, supplying % of the power needs of the observatory, as well as an improved data pipeline that will facilitate map delivery to the community and detection of millimeterwave astrophysical transients.",0
These include improved constraints on the scale dependence and Gaussianity of the primordial perturbations (reaching (floc NL) = ); improved constraints on new light relativistic species (reaching (Neff) = .); tight constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses ( (Pm ) = .,0
"In general, the high-SNR component-separated blackbody temperature and Comptonymaps, as well as the reconstructed gravitational lensing maps, from the complete SO LAT survey will enable a broad range of cosmological and astrophysical science, which we have only briefly covered in this paper.",0
"As evidenced by progress in cosmology in recent decades, a data set this rich will enable additional science that has yet to be envisioned or forecast here.",0
"The sensitive, large-area maps of millimeter-wavelength emission in both total intensity and linear polarization will enable a wealth of Galactic and extragalactic science, and will open new discovery space in the time domain.",0

"Notably, students demonstrated improved recognition of radians in physical contexts (% correct responses) compared to mathematical ones, suggesting that students rely on familiar physical equations as cognitive reference points when applying mathematical concepts.",0

"In introductory physics courses, especially at the high school level or in algebra-based college physics, there exists a hybrid approach to these representations.",0

Approximately % of participants correctly identified that the standard harmonic oscillator equation assumes angle measurements in radians.,0
"The observed improvement in recognizing radians in physics may stem from students relying on their familiarity with well-established physical equations, rather than a conceptual understanding of why radians must be used.",0
"A similar pattern has been observed in mechanics education, where alternative conceptions persist despite students strong confidence in their reasoning.",0
"Research on students understanding of force and motion has shown that misconceptions in mechanics are often accompanied by high confidence, reinforcing the idea that such errors are not merely the result of missing knowledge but rather stem from deeply ingrained alternative conceptions [].",0
"This interpretation is further supported by our linear regression analysis, which identifies explicit uncertainty statements as the most significant predictor of reduced confidence.",0
This reinforces the idea that confidence in incorrect responses is not merely a function of accumulated coursework but rather stems from deeper cognitive structures and alternative conceptions.,0
"Engineering curricula often emphasize structured mathematical problem-solving and applied differential equations, which could contribute to stronger performance in these tasks.",0
A key assumption in physics education is that success in foundational courses such as Mechanics and Calculus should correlate with the student s ability to apply fundamental mathematical tools correctly in physical contexts.,0
Our findings indicate that this assumption does not hold: self-reported grades in Mechanics and Calculus were not significant predictors of success in either Q3 or Q4.,0
"Chi-square analyses revealed no significant associations between performance in these courses and correctness, except for two isolated cases Calculus scores in Israel for Q3 and Mechanics scores in India for Q4 neither of which held consistently across other countries.",0
"To further investigate, we conducted a multivariate logistic regression analysis that holds other explanatory variables constant, allowing for a clearer assessment of the independent effect of grades.",0
"In this analysis, neither the mechanics nor the calculus scores were statistically significant predictors of success in Q3 or Q4.",0
"This result suggests that even students with strong technical backgrounds in Mechanics and Calculus struggle to correctly identify and apply trigonometric derivatives, reinforcing the cognitive blind spot hypothesis.",0
"These findings align with previous research in Physics Education Research (PER), including Mazur [], who demonstrated that algorithmic expertise does not ensure conceptual understanding.",0

":Global Galactic Parameters describe SSP physics and comprise the high-mass Chabrier IMF slope, IMF, which e ffectively sets the number of CC-SNe a SSP generates and (logarithmic) Type Ia SN normalization, log10(NIa), which controls the total number of SN Is per SSP.",0
"(2018c, Tab. ), and we note that the SN II yields are renormalized such that the IMF-weighted yield ratios at each metallicity are equal to those from the Kobayashi et al. mass range models alone.",0
"To facilitate best comparison with Ilustris TNG, we further set the maximum SN II mass as M (matching the IMF upper mass limit), adopt stellar lifetimes from Portinari et al. and do not allow for any hypernovae (in contrary to Philcox et al. )).",0
"Neural network emulator for CHEMPY Despite the simplifications made by the GCE model CHEMPY , the run-time of CHEMPY and the high-dimensionality of the parameter space incurs some di fficulties when sampling the distribution of the global parameters ={ IMF,log10(NIa)}.",0
We design the NN as a simple feed-forward neural network with hidden layers and neurons in the first and neurons in the second layer.,0
"The same NN can be used for all nstarsstars (and run in parallel), reducing a set of nstarsruns of CHEMPY to a single matrix computation.",0
"/github/da abase neural network emulator) we can easily model the set of nel chemical abundances {Xj i}for the i-th star as: {Xj i}=CHEMPY ( , i,Ti), where jindexes the chemical element.",0
"The final model was selected after extensive hyperparameter tuning, varying: the architecture between Neural Spline Flow (NSF; Durkan et al. ), MAF, and MAF with rational-quadratic spline (MAF-RQS), the number of neurons between , , , , and the number of transformations between , , , , optimizing over the test set for both the highest mean log posterior probability and the best calibration as measured by the TARP value (Lemos et al. ).",0
We circumvent this by approximating each single star posterior by a Gaussian and fit for the parameters of mean and covariance.,0
"Therefore the resulting factorized posterior from eq. is again a Gaussian and can be expressed with mean and variance as: = ( N) prior 2 prior ( N) 2 prior 2= ( N) 2 prior Given the tiny and simple neural network that represents our NPE, we note that the above assumption of Gaussianity in each of the single star posteriors not expected to notably increase our pipeline s error.",0
In order to demonstrate the performance and robustness of our methods we use three mock data-sets: .Mock observations drawn from CHEMPY from the same yield set as the training data for the neural network emulator.,0
"Additionally we draw Tiuniformly in the range [,]Gyr to minimize overlap with the neural network training birth-time limits when observational uncertainties are included.",0
This is particularly important since sample variances play a large role when using small samples of stars as also noted in Philcox & Rybizki .,0

"9Note, as for the CHEMPY mock data, we exclude any particles with Ti<[,]Gyrto ensure that the true times are well separated from our training age limits, avoiding neural network errors.",0
"Notably, SBI retained high accuracy in scenarios where HMC struggled, particularly for the high-mass slope of the IMF ( ISM).",0
"By training neural posterior estimators on forward simulations from the CHEMPY model, we achieved precise and accurate inferences for two key parameters: the high-mass slope of the initial mass function ( IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova rates (log10(NIa)).",0
This e fficiency makes SBI uniquely suited for analyzing the massive datasets expected from next-generation spectroscopic surveys.,0

Appendix B: Neural Posterior Calibration Since SBI relies in neural networks to approximate posterior densities one important point is to check that neural network hyperparameters are well chosen and that posterior estimates are trustable.,0

"As such, SBC can be viewed as a necessary condition (but not su fficient) for a valid inference algorithm: If SBC checks fail, this tells you that your inference is invalid.",0
"Hence, SBC can tell us whether the SBI method applied to the problem at hand produces posteriors that have well-calibrated uncertainties, and if the posteriors have uncalibrated uncertainties, SBC surfaces what kind of systematic bias is present: negative or positive bias (shift in the mean of the predictions) or overor under-dispersion (too large or too small variance).",0

A Generalized Theory of Mixup for Structure-Preserving Synthetic Data Chungpa Lee Jongho Im Joseph H.T. Kim Yonsei University Yonsei University Yonsei University Abstract Mixup is a widely adopted data augmentation technique known for enhancing the generalization of machine learning models by interpolating between data points.,0
"We demonstrate that while mixup improves model performance, it can distort key statistical properties such as variance, potentially leading to unintended consequences in data synthesis.",0
"Through theoretical developments, we provide conditions under which our proposed method maintains the (co)variance and distributional properties of the original dataset.",0
"Numerical experiments confirm that the new approach not only preserves the statistical characteristics of the original data but also sustains model performance across repeated synthesis, alleviating concerns of model collapse identified in previous research.",0
"INTRODUCTION Mixup is a prominent data augmentation method (Zhang et al., ) that generates new instances by linearly combining observed instances, applicable Proceedings of the 28thInternational Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) , Mai Khao, Thailand.",0
"By training models on these interpolated samples, mixup enhances the generalization performance of state-ofthe-art neural network architectures (Verma et al., ; Yun et al., ; Guo, ; Sohn et al., ; Kim et al., ; Baena et al., ; Chen et al., ; Zhang et al., 2022b; Sun et al., ).",0
"However, this interpolation process reduces the variance, which inevitably distorts the statistical structure of the original dataset both marginally and jointly.",0
"In this regard, mixup-based synthetic datasets achieve better performance in training machine learning models from sacrificing non-representative instances, such as the tail instances, in the dataset.",0
"Our findings provide insight into how mixup alters the statistical structure of synthetic data in comparison to the original, thereby explaining why standard mixup, while beneficial for improving machine learning model performance, can lead to unintended effects in data synthesis.",0
Our key contributions are as follows: We theoretically derive a set of conditions for a mixup weight distribution that preserves the (co)variance for any pair of continuous variables in a general setting.,0
"We prove that the mean and variance of any numerical variable in a dataset, conditioned on a categorical variable in the same dataset, can be maintained within a specified error bound, which can be controlled by a function of mixup weights.",0
"As an additional contribution, we propose a new class of mixup weight distributions that satisfy these theoretical conditions, thereby preserving the original data structure with respect to both mean and variance.",0
"Our numerical experiments show that the proposed mixup method generates synthetic data that preserves fundamental distributional properties, leading to more accurate statistical inferences.",0
"Additionally, it offers the advantage of allowing explicit control over the degree of preservation of the original data structure.",0
"While the synthetic data generated by Beta or Unif is shrunken, the proposed EpBeta preserves the original data structure.",0
Another quantity of interest is the covariance because synthetic data is often required to preserve the correlation of the original data.,0
"Though they did not use in their proof, this preservation is essentially a consequence of the correlation-preserving property of the synthetic data when the mixup is conducted with equal weights as in ; the following result can shorten the proof of Zhang et al. , see Appendix A..",0
"This is motivated by the fact that preserving the mean and variance of the continuous variables conditional on the categorical variable is often necessary in data analyses; i.e., when the height of students in a school exhibit different distributions depending on gender, synthetic height datasets need to preserve their mean and variance for each gender.",0
"Both expressions in Theorem are weighted sums of two terms with the same first term E X L=l , indicating that E X L=l partly uses the same information of the original data.",0
"Assuming that the variance of the synthetic data is preserved, we can establish the following upper bound for the conditional variance.",0
"X + u  WX, WL,  ( u  WX, WL,  )   E X L=l E X. Similar to Corollary , one can make the difference of the conditional variance smaller by controlling the right side of where the only quantity at the modeler s disposal is u  WX, WL,  .",0
It is natural to employ = for the general-weight mixup as well because this cut point choice is more likely to preserve the conditional mean and conditional variance as shown in Corollary and Theorem ; we use = in what follows unless specified otherwise.,0
"In this section we propose a new mixup scheme in data synthesis that can preserve key statistics such as the mean, variance and their conditional counterparts as discussed in Sec. .",0
"Restricting the distribution s support to [ ,] does not distort the mean of the synthetic data, but it reduces the variance inevitably as shown below, which can be found in, e.g., Proposition in Kim and Kim .",0
"EpBeta( , ; , ) EpBeta( , ; , ) x0....0probability densityEpBeta(, ; , ) EpBeta(, ; , ) EpBeta(, ; , ) EpBeta(, ; , ) Figure : (Left) All ( , ) pairs that gives structure-preserving synthetic data for choices of ( 0, 1).",0
"Thus it is clear that the support of weight distribution must be expanded from [ ,] in order to obtain variancepreserving synthetic data.",0
"The following simple example illustrates that the mixup weights generated from a constrained normal distribution with support ( ,+ ) can produce variance-preserving synthetic data.",0
"This result, coupled with Theorem , suggests that can be viewed as a modulator that controls the amount of additional information to be borrowed from the original data.",0
"On the left plot in Fig. , each curve represents ( , ) pairs that satisfy Theorem for a selected ( 0, 1) choice; each point on the curve therefore produces structure-preserving synthetic data.",0
"The solid-line part of each curve further satisfies Theorem with equality for = , so that the conditional mean and variance are almost preserved; for visual simplicity, we choose ( , ) pairs that make both sides of equal with .",0
"EXPERIMENTS As in Sec , we propose the EpBeta distribution as a mixup weight distribution that more effectively preserves the original data distribution when generating synthetic data.",0
"These synthetic datasets are evaluated and compared in terms of relative bias of key statistics, statistical inference, and the machine learning efficiency.",0

This approach integrates a novel transformer-based autoencoder architecture to extract features from rs-fMRI signals with an innovative regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) clustering algorithm for the delineation of FNs.,0
Overview of TReND framework TReND is an automated self-supervised transformer-based autoencoder framework that incorporates confidence-adaptive masks to extract salient temporal features and employs geodesic-guided RNMF-KMeans clustering for robust neonatal FN delineation.,0
"To robustly parcellate neonatal FNs, we propose a clustering approach that synergistically integrates an advanced initialization strategy with regularization parameters [].",0

At saturation temperatures higher than this temperature limit the process of chemical interaction of H or N2 impurity molecules and the C matrix occurs with the formation of a new chemical compounds C 60Hx and (C 59N).,0
"The new effect of low-temperature quenching of photoluminescence has been explained by the appearance of effective capture centers of the excitons which occurs as a result of the chemical interaction of N impurity molecules and the C matrix, and the non-radiative deactivation of electronic excitation.",0
"As the temperature increases above T g, the probability of molecule reorientation increases, which inevitably leads to a violation of the coherence of states, a decrease in the exciton mean free path and, as a consequence, to an increase in the probability of excitation deactivation without radiation.",0
"The main contribution to the decrease in I at T>T g is made by the luminescence of localized states (""deep X-traps""), the concentration of which is determined, among other things, by the degree and nature of filling of intermolecular voids with impurity particles.",0
The presence of two particles in one intermolecular void has an additional braking effect on the rotational motion of fullerene molecules in the crystal lattice sites.,0
"Therefore, as our experiments on the luminescence of the C +N2 complex show, the T g point shifts toward lower temperatures, which, unlike the case of hydrogen saturation, indicates a weak impurity-matrix interaction with a simultaneous weakening of the bond between C molecules in the crystal lattice.",0
"With an increase in the saturation temperature, the diffusion mechanism of sorption into the fullerite lattice for both hydrogen and nitrogen undergoes a transition to a chemical interaction of the impurity with the matrix (chemisorption) and an adsorption crossover is observed.",0
"Based on luminescent data, a comparative analysis of the mechanisms of interaction of hydrogen and nitrogen impurities with the C60 matrix in two saturation modes was carried out. .",0
"Methods and materials For the experiments on studying the temperature behaviour of the photoluminescence of the C60+H2 and C +N2 complexes, polycrystalline samples in the form of powder with a granule size of about mm and a purity of at least % were used.",0
"In accordance with the Xray structural analysis data on the change in the lattice parameter upon saturation of C with N molecules [, ], intercalation modes were selected that clearly corresponded to the mechanisms of either only physical sorption for both impurities or those that already ensured a confident impuritymatrix chemical interaction.",0
"Thus, according to [], a purely diffusion mechanism of intercalation at a gas pressure in the cell of P= atm corresponds to a mode with a system temperature of C. From the totality of the obtained results it follows that at P= atm in the region T C the probability of chemical interaction of hydrogen with C is extremely small.",0
The cryogenic part of the experimental setup allowed changing the sample temperature in a wide temperature range of K and stabilizing it during the experiment with an accuracy of K. A -Ne laser with E exc = eV ( nm) was used to excite photoluminescence.,0
"The luminescence measurement technique, the experimental setup, and the analytical processing of the experimental results are presented in []. .",0
Localization of the Frenkel exciton on such inclusions sharply increases the probability of radiative transitions forbidden by symmetry for C molecules in an ordered lattice [].,0
"At sorption temperatures above C for hydrogen and C for nitrogen, respectively, the diffusion saturation mechanism is most likely replaced by direct chemical interaction between the molecules of the matrix and the impurity.",0
"The presence of molecules with different degrees of hydrogenation is accompanied by an increase in non-uniform stresses in the crystallites and, naturally, leads to a diffuse type of photoluminescence spectrum and its shift to the high-energy region.",0
Experiments on the study of the behaviour of the fullerite luminescence intensity with temperature changes have repeatedly shown their exceptional informativeness for understanding the features of the dynamics of transfer and relaxation of electronic excitations.,0
"For these samples, an increase in Tg was observed, which is caused by the growing interaction in the impurity-matrix system.",0
"In contrast to the above case of hydrogen physical sorption, there is no energy shift of the characteristic photoluminescence spectral bands.",0
"And if for the sample saturated at a temperature of C only changes in the quantitative parameters of the radiation are observed, then for the second sample with a saturation temperature of C we observe a radical rearrangement of the spectrum with a strong shift to the low-energy region and a noticeable decrease in the radiation intensity.",0
"An increase in the saturation temperature above C for the C +N2 system leads to a change in the diffusion mechanism of sorption to a chemical interaction of the impurity with the matrix molecules and, as a consequence, to the formation of a new nitrogen-containing substance, and possibly a mixture of several different substances based on C .",0
"As mentioned above, all previously studied two-component systems based on C , obtained by the diffusion sorption mechanism, are characterized by both a constant value of the quantum yield from low temperatures to the glass transition temperature and a subsequent decrease in intensity.",0
"Singleparticle filling of the intermolecular space with N impurity, on the contrary, facilitates mutual reorientations in the matrix nodes.",0
"Low photoluminescence intensity in the low-temperature region can be due to the emergence of complex molecular complexes during the nitriding of fullerene molecules, which play the role of quenching centers with a certain activation energy and a long lifetime.",0
"Naturally, with increasing temperature, the energy contribution of the vibrational states of these centers increases and, consequently, the probability of releasing localized electronic excitation increases.",0
"Comparison of the transformation of spectral-luminescent characteristics and their temperature behavior for the extremely saturated complexes C +H2 and C +N2 in the diffusion mode, relative to pure fullerite C , showed the opposite effect of hydrogen and nitrogen on the rotational subsystem of the crystal structure of the matrix and the efficiency of excitation transfer, respectively.",0
"If hydrogen complicates mutual reorientations of neighboring matrix molecules and increases T g, then nitrogen, on the contrary, facilitates them and thereby lowers T g.",0
"This initial formulation led to a surge of investigations exploring CE across a broad spectrum of physical systems, ranging from high-energy physics [ ], to astrophysics and cosmology [ ], and statistical physics, including phase transitions and critical phenomena [ ].",0
"Typically, trial functions, (x), are used to approximate solitonic solutions, with optimization performed by minimizing their energy.",0
"However, when multiple ans tze yield degenerate energy values, a complementary measure is required to distinguish between them.",0
"Unfortunately, the precise construction of the CC remained nebulous; for analyzing kinks the energy density was used to construct the modal fraction, while for the analysis of bubbles it was the eld itself.",0
"A similar study was performed on polytropic models of stars, with a small change in the de nition needed to describe objects with a nite radius: The modal fraction was de ned only for modes whose wavelengths were smaller than the diameter of the object, arguing that there is no informational contribution coming from length-scales larger than those needed to describe an object.",0
"This trend extended to astrophysical systems; polytropic stellar models displayed maxima in CC at the Chandrasekhar limit, beyond which gravitational collapse ensues.",0
"Such behavior is expected, as the power spectrum narrows near criticality due to an increasing dominance of longwavelength uctuations.",0
"The Hamiltonian governing the system is given by: H[ ] = J 2 T A , whereJ >0is the ferromagnetic coupling constant, andAis the adjacency matrix de ning nearestneighbor interactions.",0
"A key quantity characterizing local interactions is the energy of each spin, de ned as: = J 2 T A , where is pointwise multiplication.",0
"The left column shows spin con gurations, while the right column displays the corresponding energy distributions based on Eq.",0
"Heating remains the same, but sampling transitions to the Wol algorithm [ ], where clusters are ipped until 2Nspin ips have occurred before recording a con guration.",0
"Reported CIM values correspond to the unbiased estimator of the mean over partitions, with uncertainties given by the unbiased estimator of the standard deviation.",0
"Figures 2and3 display simulation results for both 2D and 3D Ising models, focusing on magnetization and energy congurations, respectively.",0
"In the low-temperature regime, long-wavelength modes dominate, but the uctuation power spectrum, which excludes background magnetization, remains approximately white.",0
"Secondly, for each lattice size in either dimension, the drop in magnetization CE maximizes above the critical temperature, and below it for the energy CE.",0
"This mimics the well-known nite size scaling behavior of the susceptibility and speci c heat, which too are built from the uctuation elds of the spin and energy, respectively [ ].",0
"However, the two physical quantities use powers of the temperature in their de nitions, which suppresses the high temperature behavior of the uctuating eld statistics.",0
"Firstly, for the magnetization CE drop, the hot temperature tail appears higher than its cold counterpart, while for the energy CE drop, it is the opposite.",0
"As with the duality in the CE drops between magnetization and energy, the energy CC density in 3D behaves analogously to the magnetization CC density, with high-low temperatures reversed.",0
"However, our results complicate this interpretation, as the placement of extrema di ers depending on whether energy or magnetization CC is examined.",0
"Many quantum phase transitions, for instance, defy characterization through conventional symmetry-breaking paradigms, instead relying on entanglement-based measures to identify universal behavior [ ].",0
"The presence ofI indicates that CC is fundamentally tied to how power is distributed across spectral modes, modulating CE based on how concentrated or dispersed the spectral energy is.",0
"The rst equation represents the e ective information content of the system after accounting for the dominance of a particular mode, while the second and third de ne CE and CC in terms of rescaled variables that incorporate system size.",0
"Mar trate, we can say E. coli has less relative multicellularity than the worm Caenorhabditis elegans whose development includes creating organs; the loss of a multicellular behavior by evolution would reduce an animal s relative multicellularity; the programming of a new multicellular behavior by synthetic biology would increase an organism s relative multicellularity; etc.",0
"Synthetic biology approaches have also used E. coli colonies to program new multicellular behaviors [ ], mimicking and mod-eling higher organisms.",0
Such fluid flow biofilms are sometimes regarded as selection experiments [] as they are only formed by strongly-attaching cells that may be rare within populations.,0
"E. colicolonies and fluid flow biofilms, by definition and experimental practice, are usually clonal communities ( i.e., wherein all members have derived from a single parental cell).",0
The relative importance of different communities and their corresponding experimental methods is debated among those studying the multicellular behaviors of bacteria.,0
"E. coli cells are small ( 2 m long) and we therefore imaged at maximal optical resolution; E. coli cells divide in minutes, so with the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in mind (i.e., reconstructing a digital periodic signal requires it to be sampled at least twice the rate of its frequency), we imaged every minutes.",0
We made these findings using experiments that allowed cells freedom of motion while also keeping them within the limited depth-of-field of high-magnification.,0
Such systems could be used to study natural bacterial multicellularity or to troubleshoot multicellular synthetic biology approaches.,0
E. Dynamic graphs for multicellular communities Graph theory (often used interchangeably with network theory ) is the study of sets of objects and the connections between them.,0
"This point may also suggest limits on the ability of artificial intelligence (AI), which extrapolates general patterns from existing data, to understand multicellular biology.",0
"This could be by design: structurally rigid fimbriae, which grow to m, would sterically block cell repositioning if they were present; and sticky extracellular matrix components (curli and polyglucosamine) would reduce cells freedom of motion and might additionally attach them to surfaces or adhere them to other cells.",0
"Hence, though mostly lacking after rosette formation, flagella-mediating folding appears to self-regulate the multicellular geometry of communities during extension.",0
In this case fracturing rate depends on the strength of cell-cell adhesion in communities and external or cell-produced forces.,0
"Though experimentally straightforward, biofilms had not been investigated by using the same strain but with two colors, though similar approaches are common in studying range expansion within colonies on solid media [ ].",0
Considerable support also comes from biofilm experiments showing chains once attached and that biofilms themselves grow through successive attachment of chains on top of one another.,0
"Rosette formation (with its balance of forces) and multicellular extension (with its moderate stability) require hydrostatic conditions, which are common in nature and generally encountered near physical surfaces.",0
"For molecules like AI-, the quorum needed in liquid cultures [] could result from cells trying to sense a multicellular signal while being separated into individuals by external forces.",0
"Production of the extracellular matrix, a interwoven mesh of proteins and polysaccharides, within lumens further controls communication; it can selectively limit diffusion of molecules and concentrate others near cell surfaces [].",0
But it may be in the future: E. coli actively stabilizes and extends its inner volume while adapting its properties by extracellular matrix components like curli [].,0
Rosette formation establishes an inner space in just two cell divisions from the first cell and it orients cells to synchronously grow in tube-like communities based on their natural division geometry.,0
"Though multicellularity in a simple sense is an inevitable consequence of cell division: unless separated by their own actions or external forces, sister cells would remain together.",0
"In this case, cells remain together even if they are actively trying to separate, and their arrangement is determined by their shape and the force of their cellular growth.",0
"Regarding their multicellular graphs ( Fig. ), nodes are added by division and cannot be lost; edges are determined by steric effects of surface constraints and cell shape and packing statistics.",0
"Steric forces can push cells on top of each other and into three dimensional communities, in which case organization is dependent on adhesins as well as [, ].",0
"In a strict sense, division is not required and would confound statistical description of aggregation if not controlled for experimentally.",0

"Constrained-organization : community organization is dictated by an external surface, colonies being the canonical example, as cells are forced to grow multicellular-ly.",0
Mechanics and packing statistics effectively capture organization in these communities; graph propagation is determined by cell division and physical constraints.,0
"Thermodynamic equilibrium models treating cells as particles capture key aspects of these communities; graph propagation is random and depends on density and surface properties, which determine the probabilities of collision and adherence, respectively.",0
"Post-rosette formation, E. coli produces extracellular matrix components, fimbriae and curli, to propagate the inner space between cells and regulate its shape.",0

"This kind of risk can indeed be associated to the probability of realization of systemic events in which a large number of institutions default together (see e.g. Montagna et al., ; Gourieroux et al., ).",0
"Under these general assumptions, we propose a recursive algorithm to derive portfolio losses distribution modeling explicitly default clustering.",0
"The paper is structured as follows: Section presents a review of the literature, Section introduces our contagion model and describes the algorithm for the portfolio loss distribution.",0
"Section concludes, while proofs of theoretical results are provided in Appendix A. Literature review One of the main problems in credit modeling is the default clustering: it has been observed, especially during recessions, that defaults are not uniformly spaced in time but rather tend to concentrate over small periods of time (see e.g. Azizpour et al., presenting evidence of default clustering in the US market).",0
"The most used approaches to introduce dependence among defaults (via exposure to common factors, by correlating the default intensity processes, and by direct application of copula methods) struggle to replicate the observed clustering pattern.",0
"Similarly, Azizpour et al. find that the amount of default clustering cannot be explained by the exposure to observable and latent factors, showing strong evidence of contagion dynamics.",0
"Still, the direct modeling of the correlation between default intensity processes introduces a weak dependency resulting in a lower joint probability of defaults than expected for highly correlated entities (Jouanin et al., ).",0
Onevalidalternativeistoexplicitlyenrichthemodelingframeworkwithcontagionorinfection mechanisms; this increases the probability of observing extreme losses in the portfolio and can also account for default clustering.,0
Adding this particular dependency structure introduces a looping mechanism that makes calibration problematic: the probability of default of each name can impact and is impacted by the probability of default of the others.,0
"InNeuandK hn,firmscanhaveeithermutuallysupportiveorcompetitiverelationships betweenthem; adefaultwillhencedecreasethedefaultprobabilityofcompetitorsbutincrease the same quantity for firms that had positive inflows from the name in distress (for example suppliers/clients).",0
"The solution proposed by the authors leads to closed form results for the loss distribution at the cost of quite strict assumptions: the portfolio considered has to be homogeneous with respect to the probability of idiosyncratic default, the infection rates and the losses given default (LGD).",0
"ThemutuallyindependentBernoullivariables Xi(t), Vi(t), Ui(t),i= , ..., n,haveprobability P{Xi(t) = }=pi, P{Ui(t) = }=ui, P{Vi(t) = }=vion a time horizon [,t].",0
"We stress that piis not the final probability of default of the name, as the latter (i.e. pi:=P{Zi= }) is the result not only of pibut also of the rate of infections from the other names as well as its own ability to benefit from immunization via ui.",0
"We present a useful proposition that is proved in appendix A and that provides P{Zi= }, the probability of default of a single name.",0
"The above result shows that the marginal default probability of entity iis a function of its idiosyncratic default probability, its immunization ability and the component I{i}.",0
"We further partition the probability space on the basis of the indicator function ICthat is equal to one if there is at least one infection active and zero otherwise: IC= ,ifPn i=1XiVi> ,otherwise.",0
"n(h, k, t )represents the probability of realizing hunits of losses in an uncontaminated world of nnames, in which there are also kunits of losses at risk should an infection appear.",0
"On the other hand, n(h, k, t )represents the probability of realizing h+kunits of losses in a contaminated universe of nnames of which hare due to idiosyncratic defaults and kare due to pure infection.",0
"Moreover, the final distribution of the portfolio losses does notdepend on the order chosen when adding names in the above algorithm.",0
The following result ensures instead that the probability of observing no losses is a (decreasing) function only of the pi.,0
"Using the above result, we can be sure that the probability of observing no losses will decrease in time if the probabilities of idiosyncratic default in the two specifications of the model are increasing i.e. t1< t2, p i(t1) pi(t2), i= P{Ln(t1) = } P{Ln(t2) = }.",0
"The idea is to consider a system with two possible regimes: at time t, we assume that the world is in any of two states: a contagion state with probability , and a common factor state or correlated default state with probability .",0
"From an economic standpoint, the approach is consistent with a market in which the two potential states can manifest, players are uncertain about the possible future state of the world, and assign a probability to each of them.",0
"This application will hence show the tractability of the system of equations -, and the quality of fit of both the contagion model and the mixture model, in comparison with the one factor Gaussian model that serves as a baseline benchmark.",0
"ConcerningtheContagionmodels(CON),thefullimplementationofthemodelinEquation would require the calibration of 3nparameters, and would be impractical.",0
We propose thus a restricted version of the model with only a single free parameter to control how much probability of default comes from idiosyncratic effects versus contagion ones.,0
"The proposed relationship are motivated by economic considerations: The individual probability of default contains information on both idiosyncratic and contagion risk, in a proportion regulated by the parameter .",0
Note that we need <1as we always need at least one initial idiosyncratic event to trigger contagion effects; Thevi(t)are in an inverse relationship with pi(t); this reflects the fact that healthier firms have a bigger impact in case of idiosyncratic default than riskier ones; the market is expecting default of risky firms (hence the high probability of default) and therefore the shock when the event finally happen is minor.,0
"It is worth noting that we get the calibration to marginal info embedded in our multivariate model almost by construction; The idiosyncratic probability of default pi(t)is, for every i, directly proportional to pi(t) and hence it is increasing in time.",0
"Thanks to the comments made after proposition , with this choice we also guarantee that the probability of observing no losses is a decreasing function of time; We underline that this specification of the model is still handling heterogeneous portfolios (the marginal probability of defaults of the names are different from each other).",0
"Finally, the mix model (MIX) has three parameters: and for the correlated defaults and contagion states , respectively, and the mixing probability (see Equation ). .",0
"Since some of the quotes were very close to zero, we added a translation of in the quotes used in the objective function to avoid denominator close or equal to zero to improve the numerical stability of the optimization.",0

"The implementation of SU( N) lattice gauge theories in the original formulation by Kogut and Susskind [] is notoriously difficult on both classical and quantum computers, at least if one is interested in the limit of gauge coupling g , corresponding to the continuum limit of the lattice theory.",0
"In combination with local gauge invariance, the non-Abelian structure of such theories and the practical requirement for digitization and truncation lead to non-localities in formulations suitable for this limit, or severe increase in resource requirements.",0
We have tested this approach in the free theory and found that the continuum energy levels and eigenstates are recovered in the limit of continuous gauge symmetry.,0
Like the position operator in quantum mechanics the link operator modifies the wave function by multiplying with the gauge link degree of freedom labelled by xandk.,0
"When decreasing g2the entanglement between links increases with the wave function only being non-vanishing for configurations where all the Px,ij .",0
"Furthermore, one could now make use of the fact that the wave function of the system only is non-vanishing for Px,ijclose to the identity.",0
"This could be exploited by choosing a basis for the wavefunctions that is suitable for approximating wavefunctions distributed around Px,ij=1well.",0
In the following we will enforce Gauss law by adding a penalty term Hpenalty = X c Qc to the Hamiltonian of the theory.,0
"DISCRETISING THE OPERATORS As the Hilbert space of wave functions is in principle infinite-dimensional, in general a discretisation and possibly a truncation is needed for a practical numerical simulation.",0
"The full Hilbert space of the theory can be decomposed into products of wave functions on single gauge links |{fx,k} =O x,k|fx,k .",0
"Thus, it is sufficient to find discretisation schemes for the single link wave functions fx,k(U) :G C. More specifically, we will use the finite element canonical momenta we presented in Ref.",0
The rotation matrix R is needed to ensure that the planes of the lattice are not aligned with the faces of the unit cube.,0
: Sketch of the truncation procedure used in the dual Hamiltonian: On the left sphere we show the expected shape of the plaquette wave function towards weaker coupling.,0
"Furthermore, much better matching with the analytic predictions can be achieved, when correcting for energy contributions by the penalty term.",0
"The penalty term however, leads to an overestimation of the ground state energy and mass gap, while the plaquette expectation value is notably smaller than predicted.",0
"This suggests, that the correct states are still found, but their electric energy is underestimated by the meshed operators.",0
This is likely because states with a large plaquette expectation value have more electrical energy and thus also lead to larger discretisation errors in the penalty term.,0

"By choosing Tr optimally for each coupling value, we then numericallyshow that the relative deviations of the mass gap of the theory are independent of the coupling value.",0

"Introduction Over the past decade, novel challenges have emerged within the do main of nancial risk management, as well as in the modelling and treatment of high uncertainties (see fo r instance [,,]).",0
The corresponding contemporary challenges generally lead to the stud y of optimization problems involving an objective function with values in a preordered hyperspace by a convex cone.,0
These are set-valued optimization problems where the objective functions usually have as codomain the set of the nonempty subsetsofarealnormedvectorspace.,0

"[] extended this work by proposing a topological fram ework for conlinear spaces, devoted to handling set-valued optimization problems, called set order topolo gy.",0
"From now on, we will refer to any space of set-valued maps whose codomain is a conlinear space eq uipped with the set order topology as a set order functional space.",0
"In the context of set-valued optimization, stability analysis refers to the study of the asymptotic behavior of solution sets under data perturbation.",0
[] introduced the concepts of external (or upper) and internal (or lowe r) stability for set-valued optimization problems based on the set approach [ ].,0
It should be noted that virtually all re cent work dealing with the stability of minimal solutions to set-valued optimization problems pays particu lar attention to the structure of the codomain of the objective function (often called image space).,0
"Most of the work on the topic has studied Painlev eKuratowski and/or Hausdor convergence of sequences of solu tions of approximated set optimization problems to solutions of the original problem in the image space (see [ ,,,,]).",0
"It is worth noting that in the context of vector optimization, several concepts of Gamma convergence have been proposed to address stability analysis (see for instance Oppezzi and Rossi [ ,] and Geo roy et al.",0
"Therefore, since issues related to the structure of the image spa ce have gained much attention in the litterature, we proposeto study stability analysisin the context of set ordertopology, which is well suited when studying set-valued optimization problems.",0
"In this work, we int roduce a new set order functional space called Geo roy space along with the notion of Geo roy minimality for set-valued optimization.",0

"In the dynamic version of the problem, the goal is to design a data structure that supports both efficient queries and updates, i.e. insertions and deletions in S. This problem has been widely studied in various settings, ranging from points in the plane to more general distance measures and even points within simple polygons.",0
"Updating sites often results in local changes to the solution or data structure, while updating the domain may incur many global changes.",0
We present a near-linear size in both the number of sites and the complexity of the polygon data structure with sublinear update and query time.,0
"Aronov [ ] showed that the so called geodesic Voronoi diagram in a simple polygon withmvertices has complexity O(n+m), and gave an O((n+m)log(n+m)logm)time algorithm to construct it.",0
The most prominent work that we are aware of that specifically maintains some data structure on top of a dynamic polygonal domain is the work by Goodrich and Tamassia [ ].,0
"An insertion may also structurally change the triangulation of the polygon (which is the foundation upon which, e.g., the data structure of Agarwal, Arge, and Staals [ ] is built).",0
"We overcome these challenges, and present the first dynamic data structure for the geodesic nearest neighbor problem that allows updates to both the sites Sand the simple polygonPcontainingS. Our data structure achieves sublinear query and update time and allows the following updates on PandS(Fig.",0
"Our data structure uses O(n(log logn+logm) +m)space, supports the above updates in amortized O(n3/+m3/)time, and answers queries in expected O(n3/+n1/4m1/)time.",0
"Our data structure essentially consists of two independent parts, both of which critically build upon balanced geodesic triangulations [ ].",0
"Section describes the first part of our data structure, which can be regarded as an extension of the dynamic two-point shortest path data structure of Goodrich and Tamassia [ ].",0
"Our main technical contribution is in Section , which describes the second main part: a (static) data structure that can answer nearest neighbor queries in a subpolygon QofPthat can be specified at query time.",0
"For this data structure, we need to generalize some of the results of Agarwal, Arge, and Staals [ ], which we present in Section .",0
The main component is a balanced geodesic triangulation with dual tree T. A secondary dynamic point location data structure [ ] is build for this geodesic triangulation.,0
"Overview of the data structure Our dynamic nearest neighbor data structure for a dynamic simple polygon consists of two independent data structures: a Dynamic Shortest Path data structure, which remains up-to-date, and a Cone Query data structure, which is static and is rebuild after a number of updates.",0
"Furthermore, we denote by Pand mthe polygon and number of vertices and by Sand nthe set of sites and its size at the last rebuild of the Cone Query data structure.",0
"When given a query point q, we first use the Dynamic Shortest Path data structure to compute the distance from qto each of the newly inserted sites, i.e. in S\ S. This gives us the nearest neighbor of qamong these sites.",0
"To find the nearest neighbor of qamong S, we first use the Dynamic Shortest Pathdata structure to find O(k)regions inP, where each region Ris paired with an apex pointvRon R. Each regions has the property that the shortest path P(p,q)from a point p Rtoqis given by P(p,vR) P(vR,q).",0
This means that the nearest neighbor of qinP of the sites S Ris the same as the nearest neighbor of vRin Pof the same sites S R. This is where the Cone Query query data structure comes into play.,0
"After querying the Cone Query data structure for each of the O(k)regions generated by theDynamic Shortest Path data structure, we return the nearest neighbor of qamong S, which is the closest of these O(k)sites.",0

"Introduction The study of quantum gravity has always been a frontier and hot topic in fundamental physics, the main reason is that people find that the singularity problem and information loss problem have been arisen in the study of black hole and also find that general relativity and quantum theory are incompatible under the current framework [ ].",0
"The starting point for many quantum gravity models is the belief that Lorentz symmetry may be violated at ultra-high energy scale, such as Email address: @whu.edu.cn (Jinwen Hu) Preprint submitted to Elsevier March , 2025arXiv:.03522v1 [physics.gen-ph] Mar near the Planck energy scale.",0
"The most typical model to hold this view is the double special relativity model (DSR model), which not only considers the speed of light to be a constant, but also introduces another constant called minimum length or maximum energy , which leads to a modification to the energy-momentum dispersion relation of particles at extremely high energy scale [, ].",0
"The research on the DSR model can be seen in many literature, and which is believed to be able to solve some challenging problems in the ultra-high energy field [ ].",0
"[] (i.e., our previous work) we proposed another possible Lorentz violation model, which contains only one parameter in the dispersion relation equation of particles.",0
"[] naturally returns to the Lorentz model at low and medium energy scale, and when the velocity of particle is close to cthe energy of the particle tends to a limited value (which is similar to the DSR model), rather than to be infinite as predicted by the Lorentz model.",0
"As one knows in special and general relativity the speed of light occupies a central status, so for most Lorentz violation models, the (local) speed of light is assumed to be variable.",0
"And at the same time, correspondingly, the dispersion relation of particle with rest mass m0, compared to the form as in the Lorentz model, is modified as E2=p2k2+E2 where E0=m0k2, E= m0k2denotes the particle s total energy, p= m0vdenotes the particle s momentum, and = (v,c), k=k(v,c).",0
"[] it allows the speed of light is variable between inertial systems (especially it allows the observed speed of light tends to when the velocity of light source relative to the observer is close to c), so the usual quantum relation of photons (i.e., Eq. ) will no longer be applicable in this case.",0
"The answer is that our current quantum theory is built on the basis of Lorentz symmetry, and if the energy is high enough that the Lorentz symmetry is obviously broken, the quantum theory should be modified.",0
"One piece of evidence is the proposal of various models of quantum gravity, which aim to explore the new physics that may emerge when energy is pushed to a very high level.",0

"After decades of effort, the mechanism, experiment design and numerical simulation subjecting to the cyclotron maser have been analyzed extensively [ ].",0
"[, ], the author found that the Compton scattering mechanism of virtual photons can be used to analyze the spontaneous radiation in a cyclotron maser (In the spontaneous radiation theory of the free electron laser, the periodic static magnetic field in the oscillator is also regarded as virtual photons, which are then converted into real photons by the Compton scattering between virtual photons and relativistic particles []).",0

"Here one may be confused that why the correction coefficient corresponding to photon s energy and momentum are different, which seems to violate the intuition obtained from the Lorentz model.",0
"However, although the correction coefficients for energy and momentum are different, they are still closely related (the underlying mechanism is that time and space are a whole, while Eq. has indicated that space and time are a whole), which is shown in Eq. .",0
"The reason is that, when v > v wave shock , the timing sequence is reversed, which has been discussed in Section Doppler effect of photons .",0
"and that when v=n, = (here it should be noted that, although 2= in this case, both the momentum and energy of photons are finite, which has been stated in the paragraph following Eq. ), and when v (n,), 2increases dramatically and tends to be another non-zero value, which is obviously different from the results predicted by the Lorentz model that in the case where v c, the observed wavelength of light by the observer in the laboratory system is close to (correspondingly, the momentum and energy of the photon are infinite). .",0
"Inverse Compton scattering The interaction between photons and other particles is often occurred in the high energy field, for example, the interaction between gamma-photons and nuclei, the interaction between gammaphotons and nucleons, etc.",0
"The scattering between extremely relativistic particles and photons is called inverse Compton scattering process, for that photons can obtain energy from particles in this process.",0
"Unlike the Compton scattering process, in which the particles are basically stationary, in the inverse Compton scattering process the particles are extremely relativistic.",0
"However, their method of deriving the relationship between the scattered photon and the incident photon is the same, that is, they all use the law of energy conservation and momentum conservation shown in Eq. .",0
"a a2 h m0( cos ) where 1 and 2 represent the wavelengths of incident and scattered photons observed in S respectively, denotes the scattering angle.",0
"Next we consider the case where = (for that in this case a maximum energy can be obtained by the photon from the particle), and correspondingly it has = .",0
"it can be seen that when n=v/c,P2has a maximum value, that is Pmax = nv/ch 1q v/c n(n+v/c)2h m0+ ( nv/c) 1 v/c n(n+v/c) h 2h m0 vwave shock + 1( vwave shock ) where vwave shock comes from Eq. .",0
"For the observer in S, if the observed energy of the electron is much greater than that of the incident photon, Eq. can be further simplified as Pmax 2m0 vwaveshock And in addition, what we are more interested in is that what would happen if v c, in which casen .",0
"we can obtain lim v cP2= lim v ch 22h m0+ 1 2=hq lnQ Q 12h m0+ lnQ Q 1 1 As one knows, in the Lorentz model, when the velocity of the electron is close to the speed of light, the maximum energy that a photon can obtain through inverse Compton scattering process tends to be infinite.",0
"However, if Qis not equal to (when Q= , then n and the model discussed above will return to the Lorentz model), then the maximum energy that a photon can obtain through inverse Compton scattering process will have a limit, which is shown in Eq. , and further when the velocity of electron is high enough to be close to c, the maximum energy that a photon can obtain instead drops to another non-zero and limited value.",0
"it can be seen that the maximum energy that a photon can obtain is not related to the wavelength of the incident photon, and the ratio of the maximum energy that a photon can obtain to the rest energy of an electron is a constant, which is very interesting.",0
"That is, in inverse Compton scattering, no matter what the energy of the incident photon is, and no matter whether the extremely relativistic particle is an electron or a proton or other particle with mass, the ratio of the maximum energy that a photon can obtain to the rest energy of the extremely relativistic particle is a constant.",0
"One model used to explain this mechanism is the lepton origin model, which considered that the high energy radiation comes from the inverse Compton scattering process between relativistic electrons and low energy photons [ ].",0
"Since some special objects with extreme physical properties, such as the blazars, can produce extremely relativistic particle jets, and the microwave background radiation (CMB) provides natural low-energy photons, then there provides a cosmic version of inverse Compton scattering.",0
"Therefor, we expect to test the value of Q by analyzing the ultra-high energy radiation spectrum in such a cosmic scenario, for that whether the value of Qis will have a very different effect on the ultrahigh energy radiation spectrum, which is shown in this section. .",0
"Summary The Lorentz violation model is widely studied in the ultra-high energy field in recent years, especially is considered in various models attempting to unify the general relativity and quantum theory [ ].",0
"[] the energy limit of the particle is related to the rest mass of the particle, while in the rainbow model it is not, but is assumed to be a constant (the constant is usually considered to be the Planck energy or near the Planck energy).",0
"[] that the speed of light observed by an observer moving with a velocity vrelative to the light source is nc, then it will forces us to have to modify the usual quantum relation of photons in the Doppler effect.",0
"[], we find that light can also arise the shock phenomena (in vacuum) just like sound wave, and further we obtain the conditions for light to generate a shock wave, that is, v=nc, and in the case where nc<v<c the timing sequence will be reversed, but it doesn t violate the law of causality for that the timing sequence can be reversed in independent events (but not in dependent events).",0
"and the electron is discussed, and we find that unless we define a suitable correction coefficient for the quantum relation of photons, the photons energy will be infinite in the case where v=nc, which makes it impossible to discuss the Compton scattering process between photons and electrons over the whole range of v [,c), in other words, due to the infinite energy of photon in the case where v=nc, the Compton scattering between photons and electrons will be invalid.",0
"So in order to avoid that we defined a suitable and concise correction coefficient for the quantum relation of photons to make the energy of photons have a limited value over the whole range of v [,c), especially in the case where v=ncorv c. Here it should be noted that, due to the limited information or knowledge we have at present, we are not yet able to obtain the specific correction coefficients for the quantum relation of photon satisfying Eq. , but we can obtain three key constraints for the possible correction coefficients, which is shown in Section Spontaneous radiation in cyclotron maser .",0
"By analyzing the Doppler effect and Compton scattering effect of virtual or real photons in the cyclotron maser, we can obtain the wavelength formulas of spontaneous radiation and synchrotron radiation.",0
"The important conclusion we have drawn is that we find in the case where v c the wavelength observed by the observer in the laboratory system does not tend to , but tends to a non-zero value, which is different from the results derived from the Lorentz model that the wavelength tends to and the corresponding energy and momentum of photon tend to be infinite.",0
"Even in the case where v=nc, the wavelength is , but the energy and momentum of photon are both finite, which ensures the Compton scattering is valid over the whole range of v [,c), since in Ref.",0
"Further, the inverse Compton scattering phenomenon based on Eq. is also discussed, and we find that there is a limit to the maximum energy that can be obtained by photons in the collision process between relativistic particles and low-energy photons, and this case occurs when the velocity of particle satisfies v=vwave shock .",0
"When the velocity of particle is greater than vwave shock and close to c, the energy that can be obtained by the photon decreases sharply and tends to be another limited value.",0
"This conclusion is also very different from that predicted by the Lorentz model, in which the energy that can be obtained by the photon tends to be infinite as the velocity of particle approaches to c. Generally, the main purpose of this paper is the same as that of Ref.",0
"[], that is, to avoid the energy or momentum of particles (i.e., any particles, including photons) to be infinite (otherwise it will make the real physical situation invalid in certain cases), and which is also inspired by the idea in some quantum gravity models [, , ].",0
"Therefor, this paper also show us another possible experimental scheme to determine the value of Q, although it still requires extremely high experimental energy.",0

"Given the increasing availability of financial text data and the growing impact of machine learning in market prediction, the integration of sentiment indicators into algorithmic trading models has become a rapidly expanding area of research (Tetlock et al., ; Heston and Sinha, ).",0
"The increasing reliance on quantitative sentiment measures has led to a rapid rise in studies using textual analysis and machine learning to predict financial market trends (Tetlock et al., ; Heston and Sinha, ).",0
"Sentiment analysis is now commonly integrated into algorithmic trading models, where real-time news feeds and investor sentiment indices inform buy and sell decisions (Rao and Srivastava, ; Karoui, ).",0
"Brown and Cliff further showed that investor optimism and pessimism influence asset pricing, with excessive sentiment often leading to stock market mispricing.",0
"Advancements in natural language processing and machine learning have shifted sentiment analysis toward text-based methodologies, allowing researchers to extract investor sentiment from financial news, earnings reports, and corporate disclosures.",0
"Jegadeesh and Wu found that analyst reports and corporate disclosures play a crucial role in shaping investor expectations and asset pricing, further validating the role of text-based sentiment measures.",0
"Their research highlights the superior accuracy of deep learning-based sentiment extraction, particularly in the context of algorithmic trading and quantitative investment strategies.",0
"The increasing reliance on real-time sentiment insights has made sentiment analysis an indispensable tool for hedge funds, investment banks, and quantitative traders, reinforcing its role in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and risk assessment.",0
"Some studies have attempted to enhance lexicon-based sentiment classification by incorporating sentiment modifiers such as word pair relationships and negation detection algorithms (Schumaker and Chen, ; Li, ).",0
"However , even with these improvements, lexicon-based methods remain constrained by their static nature, prompting researchers to explore machine learning-based sentiment models (Heston and Sinha, ).",0
Machine learning techniques have improved sentiment classification by learning patterns from labeled datasets rather than relying on fixed word lists.,0
"To address these issues, semi-supervised and weakly supervised machine learning models have been introduced, allowing sentiment classifiers to self-train on partially labeled datasets.",0
"Research has combined lexicon-based sentiment scores with machine learning-derived features to enhance sentiment classification for financial news, earnings reports, and social media sentiment tracking (Tetlock, ).",0

"A fully connected layer processes the -dimensional vector and transforms it into three logits, which are raw scores indicating the model s confidence before probability normalization.",0

"The model assigns the sentiment label based on the highest probability , classifying the text as positive with a confidence level of percent.",0
The model determines that there is a percent probability that the sentiment is positive rather than neutral or negative.,0
This probability-based approach ensures that sentiment classification accounts for contextual nuances rather than just word frequency .,0
"A BER T-based model like FinBER T provides a probability distribution over sentiment categories, a final classification based on the highest probability , and optional raw logits, which researchers can analyze or adjust.",0
"Instead of determining whether a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral outright, GPT-type models assign probability distributions over possible sentiment-expressive words based on context.",0
"Sentiment scores in GPT-based models are computed using a softmax function, which converts raw logits into probability distributions over vocabulary tokens.",0
"In GPT-based models, softmax is applied to predict the probability of specific words that might convey sentiment, such as optimistic, concerned, or uncertain.",0
"If the model predicts optimistic as the next word after but analysts remain, the probability of a positive sentiment classification increases.",0
"The ability to provide explanatory sentiment analysis makes GPT-type models invaluable for financial analysts, hedge funds, and algorithmic trading firms that rely on nuanced sentiment insights rather than basic sentiment categorization.",0
"Conclusion Financial sentiment analysis has evolved into a crucial area of research, with applications ranging from stock market prediction to algorithmic trading.",0
"However , advancements in natural language processing and machine learning have enabled more sophisticated text-based sentiment models, improving accuracy and predictive power .",0

"A key observation in large model inference is that each parameter is accessed precisely once during token generation, eliminating any potential for parameter locality optimization.",0
"Flexible Tensor Preservation: Heuristic Parameter Management When the tensor sizes within each model layer are the same size, balanced memory locking can evenly distribute available memory across all layers.",0
"Most parameters are associated with attention tensors ( , , ) and FFN tensors ( , , , ), typically with an approximate : size ratio between one attention tensor and one FFN tensor.",0
"For example, when available memory is small, prioritizing attention parameters can save as many tensors as possible in memory, reduce the number of IO operations, and implement larger-size IO through FFN tensors.",0
"When memory is considerable, saving all FFN tensors can minimize memory fragmentation and the difference in residual size between layers, keeping each layer s IO overhead uniform.",0

When memory is limited: Attention tensors are prioritized if memory is insufficient to hold one FFN parameter for all layers.,0
"Intermediate cases: When memory falls between these two extremes, FFN parameters are selected incrementally until the remaining memory cannot hold one FFN tensor for all layers.",0
This heuristic ensures that the remaining parameters across layers and any unused memory fragments do not exceed the size of a single attention tensor.,0
"When the remaining memory cannot hold an extra tensor for all layers, we prioritize the attention tensor to reduce the differences across layers and prioritize the large-size IO of FFN.",0
"Implementation The FlexInfer framework was implemented with lines of C/C++ code, extending llama.cpp [ ] to incorporate asynchronous prefetching, balanced memory locking, and flexible tensor preservation.",0

"Kuhn s Theorem for Games of the Extensive Form with Unawareness Ki Vin Foo Burkhard C. Schipper March , Abstract We extend Kuhn s Theorem to games of the extensive form with unawareness.",0
"Kuhn s Theorem states that a game of the extensive form has perfect recall if and only if for each mixed strategy there is a behavior strategy that is equivalent in terms of the probabilities of reaching nodes in the game tree (Kuhn, ).",0
Almost the entire literature invokes the perfect recall assumption and often invokes in some form or another Kuhn s Theorem.,0
"In that regard, it is fair to say that Kuhn s Theorem is one of the most fundamental theorems on games of the extensive form.",0
"Not surprisingly, it turns out that this property is also crucial for us proving the analogue of Kuhn s Theorem for games of the extensive form with unawareness.",0
"We formalize these two notions of a strategy being consistent with a node or information set in a game of the extensive form, show their relationship, and extend Kuhn s Theorem to both of these two notions in games of the extensive form with unawareness.",0
Kuhn s Theorem for games of the extensive form with unawareness helps to establish the foundation of games with unawareness.,0
"Verifiable disclosure and the failure of unraveling of information is analyzed by Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper ; see Li and Schipper for an experiment.",0
Note that so far we treat nature like any other player except that at terminal nodes we do not assign payoffs to nature.3We do not need to require that nature moves first or that nature moves according to a pre-specified probability distribution (although these assumptions can be imposed in our framework).,0
We extend the definitions of information set reached to mixed and behavior strategies in the obvious way by considering nodes/information sets reached with strict positive probability.,0
"Kuhn s Theorem In games of the extensive form without unawareness but with perfect recall, Kuhn s Theorem asserts that for every mixed strategy profile there is an equivalent behavior strategy profile.",0
Kuhn s Theorem can be extended to games of the extensive form with unawareness using a notion of equivalence based on the notion of reaching nodes.,0
"For any node n, any player i I0, and any opponents profile of strategies s i(including nature if any), let (n| i, s i) and (n| i, s i) denote the probability that ( i, s i) and ( i, s i) reach node n, respectively.",0
"P(n )in n Treaches n. In the following, we extend for better comparison a textbook proof of Kuhn s Theorem (e.g., Maschler, Solan, and Zamir, , Chapter ) to the more complicated set up of games of the extensive form with unawareness.",0
"It allows us to show which modifications are necessary as compared to standard games, and emphasizes that the basic idea of proof remains the same although the setting is considerably more complicated.",0
This is significant because strategies are defined for each information set (rather than decision node) of player i. Proof of Lemma .,0
"Theorem In every game of the extensive form with unawareness, if player ihas perfect recall, then for every mixed strategy of player ithere exists an equivalent behavior strategy.",0
"= , define i(hi(n)) in an arbitrary way provided that it constitutes a probability measure over actions available at hi(n).",0
Observe that both the numerator and the denominator of the right-hand side of Equation are independent of nodes in hi(n).,0
"To show that for all n Di, i(hi(n)) is a probability measure over Ai(hi(n)), note first that, in the case ofP si Si(n) i(si) = , this follows directly from Equation .",0
"While most textbooks in game theory just focus on the arguably more relevant direction of Kuhn s Theorem for standard games without unawareness as Theorem does for games with unawareness, Kuhn s original theorem is a characterization.",0
"Corollary In a standard game of the extensive form (i.e., without unawareness), a strategy profile sreaches nif and only if noccurs with s. We extend the definitions of information sets occurring to behavior and mixed strategies in the obvious way by considering nodes/information sets occurring with strict positive probability.",0
"For any node n, any player i I0, and any opponents profile of strategies s i(including nature if any), let o(n| i, s i) and o(n| i, s i) denote the probability that node noccurs with ( i, s i) and ( i, s i), respectively.",0
"Since information sets can be viewed as functions of nodes, realization-equivalent strategies are also realization-equivalent with respect to the probability of information sets occurring.",0
"Theorem and Lemma now imply immediately the following corollary: Corollary In every game of the extensive form with unawareness, if player ihas perfect recall, then for every mixed strategy of player ithere exists a realization-equivalent behavior strategy.",0

Existing CSR methods rely on anatomical T1-weighted data and map them into the dMRI space through inter-modality registration.,0

"First, recent advances in dMRI have demonstrated the ability to successfully perform tasks like tissue segmentation and cortical parcellation directly from dMRI data [ ,,,,], tasks that previously relied heavily on anatomical T1w data.",0
"The implicit methods [ ,,,] predict intermediate voxel-wise surface representations (e.g., signed distance function, SDF), followed by post-processing methods such as topology correction using fast marching algorithm [ ] and mesh extraction using marching cubes (MC) [ ].",0

Stars form from this gas according to a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF) and evolve according to Wiersma et al. evolutionary tracks.,0
Mass and metals are sent back into the ISM via asymptotic giant branch (AGB) winds as well as Type Ia and II supernovae.,0

A star-forming gas cell from the region producing the feedback is selected probabilistically to transform into a wind particle .,0
"This wind particle then travels (with gravitational interactions, but without hydrodynamic forces) until it reaches a certain density threshold or a fixed time has elapsed.",0
"The wind particle is then dissolved, dumping its mass, momentum, thermal energy, and metals into the gas cell where it ends up.",0
"Wind particles are launched in a bipolar manner, with the direction given by v (where vand are the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the original gas cell in the rest frame of the halo) and the velocity based on the local 1D dark matter velocity dispersion.",0
"Whereas the stochastic thermal implementation of EAGLE imparts energy locally into neighboring particles, the hydrodynamically decoupled wind particles of Illustris are non-local by construction.",0
"Here we analyze the highest resolution run (Illustris-, hereafter synonymous with Illustris itself) which has particles and an initial baryon mass resolution of .",0
"We use the highest resolution run of the ( Mpc /h) volume (i.e., TNG50-), which has 21603resolution elements and an initial baryon mass resolution of 104M .",0
The SIMBA simulations (Dav e et al. ) are the successor to the MUFASA simulations (Dav e et al. ) and are run using the meshless finite mass (MFM) code gizmo (Hopkins ).,0
Wind particles are randomly assigned as cool ( T 103K) or hot (temperature set by the supernova energy minus the wind particle s kinetic energy) such that % of the wind particles are in the hot phase.,0
Also unique to SIMBA is that the mass loading factors of the winds are adopted using the results of higher resolution models that more explicitly resolve the behavior of winds in the ISM (Angl es-Alc azar et al. 2017b).,0
"At high redshift ( z >), however, these mass loading factors are manually suppressed to allow for the growth of galaxies.",0
"In this work, we make use of a ( Mpc /h) box with 5123particles (m50n512; hereafter simply SIMBA) and an initial baryon mass resolution of .",0

"It is likely that this behavior, both in the scatter and the medians, is a result of the mass distribution of the sam3We note that we perform the regression on the medians weighted by the number of galaxies in each mass bin instead of through every gradient individually to avoid the least squares algorithm from over-fitting to outliers (see Appendix C).ple changing with increasing redshift, as we will discuss in more detail in the next section.",0
Each of the models of this work employs an ISM treatment that gives rise to smooth stellar feedback (see Section ) which allows for (i) the enhancement of nuclear metallicity through inside-out growth and (ii) the persistence of the radially decreasing metallicity profiles through cosmic time. .,0
"As noted in Section , each simulation sample has a slightly different minimum stellar mass owing to the varied mass resolutions.",0
"To that end, this section first addresses how the gradients of galaxies in different mass bins evolve and then investigates the implications this has on the interpretation of the results of Section .",0
"The gradient evolution of star forming galaxies in a combination of EAGLE (dotted), Illustris (solid), TNG (dashed), and SIMBA (dot dash) broken into four stellar mass bins of width dex ranging from .0M to .0M as labeled in each panel.",0
"Generally, we find that galaxies in the lowest mass bins ( M < 109M ) tend to have virtually no redshift evolution ( dex /kpc/ z).",0
"The caveat here, of course, is that there are virtually no galaxies in any of the simulations here at stellar masses of greater than .0M atz > .",0
"Looking more quantitatively, we can fit the evolution of the gradients with a linear regression in each simulation and in each mass bin in the same way as in Section (shown in Table ).",0
"The quantitative trends confirm those of the qualitative trends: the .0M M <.0M bin has the weakest redshift evolution4, .0M M <.0M bin has the strongest, with the other two mass ranges having moderate evolution.",0
"at z in SDSS, who find that gradients are the most negative in galaxies with stellar masses of .0M < M <.5M (see, e.g., their Figure B1).",0
"Although, it should be noted that in the simulations at z= galaxies with stellar masses ranging from .0M < M <.0M tend to have the most negative gradients.",0
"On the Mass Dependence of Metallicity Gradients in Smooth Stellar Feedback Models In the previous sections, we found that galaxies in simulations that employ smooth stellar feedback have 4It should be noted though that there is a slight dip in the evolution of the gradients at z in the .0M M < .0M bin.",0
"Figure shows the metallicity gradients from EAGLE, Illustris, TNG, and SIMBA (broken down into the same mass bins as Figure ) normalized by a proxy for the size of the galaxy.",0
"In the lowest mass bin (.0M M .0M ), we find that the aforementioned dip in the strength of gradients at z (see footnote ) is reduced significantly when normalized by galaxy size.",0
"Similarly, galaxies in the highest mass bin ( M ) have very flat metallicity gradients when normalized by size that remain very flat with time.",0
"Galaxies with stellar masses of .0M M .0in EAGLE, Illustris, and TNG have virtually no redshift evolution in their gradients from z= when normalized by galaxy size.",0
"More concretely: (i) the EAGLE wind model depends on metallicity that allows for more efficient feedback at high redshift, (ii) the TNG wind model has a minimum wind speed meant to produce more efficient feedback at high redshift, and (iii) SIMBA manually decreases mass loading factors at z > to allow for more efficient galaxy growth.",0
"Finally, it should be noted that the exact normalization of the gradients in dex /RSFRis not the same between the four mass bins, notwithstanding the high redshift deviations.",0
"One possible explanation for this is the increase in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback for higher mass galaxies in the simulations (see, Booth & Schaye for EAGLE; Vogelsberger et al. for Illustris; Weinberger et al. for TNG; Angl esAlc azar et al. 2017a for SIMBA).",0
"While a detailed examination on the effects of AGN feedback on the galaxies is out of the scope of this work, it is possible that increased AGN feedback could be acting as another mixing agent in the ISM flattening metallicity gradients in higher mass galaxies. .",0
"Naturally, this means that the sample of galaxies in the smaller EAGLE box will be shifted towards lower masses (in the case of Tissera et al. , towards M .0M ).",0
"Thus, by preferentially omitting higher mass galaxies, the evolution of the gradients should be expected to be slightly flatter in the small EAGLE box.",0
"and ., respectively), the star formation histories and treatment of the ISM with an equation of state are more similar to those of high resolution simulation with strong feedback bursts (e.g., FIRE, Muratov et al. ; ).Regardless, this apparent literature tension highlights the need for robust comparisons between multiple simulation models8in single works.",0
"We first caution that the metallicity values measured in these simulations are mass-weighted, whereas those of observations are light-weighted.",0
"However, it has also been observed that the strength of the negative gradients does seem to depend on the mass of the galaxies (Belfiore et al. ).",0
"The mass dependence is seen in the simulations, too, albeit with a slight shift where the most negative gradients tend to be in slightly lower mass bins (i.e., .0M < M <.0M ).",0
"Interestingly, all of the galaxies measured in the literature thus far at z= show positive gradients across a wide range of stellar masses (.6M M .0M , Cresci et al.",0
"Beyond the impact of observational systematics, each of the simulations employs a subgrid equation of state for the dense, star forming ISM (see Section and references therein for more details).",0
"Considering the stellar masses of these systems, there is perhaps hints of a tension between the observed gradients and those of the simulations analyzed in this work, in particular with the Arribas et al. SPT0311E galaxy.",0
"In this work, we analyze the gas-phase metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies across a wide mass (.0M < M .0M ) and redshift range ( z ) in EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA.",0
"In more detail, we find that different stellar mass bins have different metallicity gradient evolution (Section and Figure ).",0
We find that galaxy stellar masses of .0M .0M have virtually no redshift evolution out to z= (although gradients are slightly more negative around cosmic noon).,0
"Meanwhile, galaxies of lower intermediate (.0M .0M ) and very high masses(.0M .0M ) have a moderate amount of redshift evolution.",0
We find that much of the mass-dependent redshift evolution of the gradients disappears when normalized by galaxy size (Figure ).,0
Gradients in these simulations then persist relatively uninterrupted owing to the relatively smooth feedback produced by the equation of state ISM.,0
"This redshift range is where the smooth feedback simulated galaxies ubiquitously have strong negative metallicity gradients, regardless of stellar mass.",0

APPENDIX A.ON SIMULATION MASS RESOLUTION DEPENDENCE The simulations analyzed in this work are of varying mass resolutions (see Section ).,0
We therefore dedicate this appendix to understanding the extent to which the results of this paper are dependent on the mass resolution of the chosen simulation.,0
The natural testing ground for this is the IllustrisTNG simulation suite as it has a (very) wide range of box sizes and mass resolutions within a fixed galaxy formation model.,0
We note that we do not modify the methodology of the main text in any way in this section (including the selection criteria based on the mass resolution of the simulation; see Sections and ).,0
"The first advantage of using the TNG suite for this analysis is that TNG50and TNG100are comparable mass resolution to EAGLE ( mbaryon = 106M ) and Illustris ( mbaryon = 106M ), while TNG50-, TNG100-, and TNG300are comparable to the mass resolution of SIMBA ( mbaryon = ).",0
"The second advantage is that the comparable resolutions span multiple box sizes and, consequently, varying mass ranges (see Section and ).",0
"Broadly speaking, TNG100and TNG50are comparable mass resolution to EAGLE (refL0100N1504 , as analyzed in this work) and Illustris (Illustris-, as analyzed in this work), whereas TNG300-, TNG100-, and TNG50are comparable mass resolution to SIMBA (m50n512, as analyzed in this work).",0
"The top two rows show the initial baryon mass resolution ( mbaryon ) and simulation box size ( Lbox), respectively, for each of the TNG runs analyzed in Appendix A. The remainder of the table is organized identically to that of Table .",0
We note that the top left panel is identical to that of Figure as none of the other TNG simulations are high enough mass resolution to robustly measure gradients at M <.0M .,0
Figure shows the evolution of the metallicity gradients broken down into the different stellar mass bins (similar to Figure ).,0
"The same general trend as noted in Section is true here: the strongest metallicity gradient evolution is present in galaxies with masses .0M M <.0M , with weaker evolution at higher (.0M M <.0M ) and lower masses (.0M M <.0M ).",0
"The first is cosmic variance; while the same box size runs (e.g., TNG50-, -, and -) were run with the same initial conditions, the larger boxes have different initial conditions.",0
"The second is that the gradient evolution mass relationship is notdiscrete, rather it is more continuous than the summary four stellar mass bins suggest.",0
"Small changes in the populations, such as there being more low-mass galaxies in TNG50and high-mass galaxies in TNG50at z >, have significant impacts on the resultant gradients.",0
"It is also worth highlighting that in the highest mass bin, at z >, the gradients have significant gradient evolution not seen in Figure .",0
"Here, however, we find that there is some evidence that these massive galaxies have quite strong negative gradients at these early times.",0
Throughout this work we quote the evolution of metallicity gradients in terms of a linear regression to the median gradients as a function of redshift weighted by the number of galaxies in each mass bin.,0
"The best-fit linear regression parameters using all galaxies, opposed to Tables and which use regressions through the median weighted by number of galaxies at each mass bin. speculated on in Section ) have a significant impact on the overall derived gradient evolution.",0
"This is because our fitting methodology ( numpy.polyfit )10uses a least squares algorithm, punishing significant outliers.",0
"Recently, a series of uniqueness theorems has revealed that the physical principles used to constrain amplitudes often constitute an overdetermined system [ ], implying that naively distinct physical principles are, in fact, notindependent.",0
"Most surprisingly, unitarity and in some cases locality were shown to emerge for free from other principles, such as gauge invariance, infrared (IR) behavior, ultraviolet (UV) scaling, or the color-kinematics duality.",0
"That these two foundational axioms of QFT are somehow emergent is not an unfamiliar statement: from a holographic perspective, the unitary and local bulk evolution encoded in the S-matrix is expected to emerge from new properties at asymptotic infinity, phrased only in terms of on-shell momenta.",0
The latest addition to this suite of defining principles is the hidden zeros [] specific kinematic configurations of external particle degrees of freedom where amplitudes vanish.,0
"However, finding such a uniqueness theorem at loop integrand level was previously considered not only difficult but fundamentally illdefined.",0
"The notion of a unique loop integrand is ambiguous for two reasons: internal loop momenta tailored to individual Feynman diagrams can be changed arbitrarily without affecting the physical amplitude, and in massless theories, one manually tosses out / terms arising from tadpole and external bubble contributions, artificially destroying any single-loop cut structure in the integrand.",0
"In scalar theories, the kinematic data for an n-point scattering amplitude is specified by the momenta of all external particles k i, satisfying momentum conservation and theon-shell condition.",0
"Unitarity, through the optical theorem, dictates that the residue on any pole of a tree-level amplitude must factorize into a product of appropriate lower-point amplitudes.",0
"For example, as shown in Fig. , each triangulation with a curve Xi,icorresponds to a Tr( 3) diagram with a tadpole, and those with Xi+,i (and no Xi,i) have massless external bubbles scaleless contributions to the integrand which famously vanish in dimensional regularization after integrating.",0
"C, we will prove that imposing any of these big mountain zeros forces the integrands in both Tr( 3) theory and the NLSM to vanish.",0
"The first term is the same for any c = in a particular zero, whereas the kinematics and particle content of the two tree sub-amplitudes depend on c , the zero, and whether we are describing Tr( 3) or the NLSM.",0
"This is because, for i = , setting Y+ = on the support of an ( i, )-zero does not force any other kinematic variables to vanish, ensuring the residues on both sides of Eq.",0
"Doing so promises to reveal other secret structures in the Tr( 3) surface integrand, but would likely first require a proof of the same fact at tree-level.",0
"Since, for this diagram, the ( ,)-zero condition only permits the removal and reattachment of the full two-particle pole, we instead now use the (,)-zero to move leg and separate it from leg .",0
"As was demonstrated in the main proof, B n+ andB n+2on the support of the zero+cut are the same functions of planar variables, just with arbitrarily distinct coefficients aiandbi.",0

"Planets with masses and densities similar to Uranus and Neptune are common among transiting exoplanets (e.g., Johnson et al. ), but our most detailed information about their prototypes comes from a single Voyager flyby of each planet in the 1980s.",0
"For all their rich structure, most regions of Saturn s main rings are roughly uniform in density, and hence are conducive to observation of a spectacular array of spiral waves (see Tiscareno & Harris ) induced by resonances with orbiting satellites (e.g., Cuzzi et al. ) or Saturn normal modes (Hedman & Nicholson and aforementioned references).",0
"We consider scenarios in which nonaxisymmetric ring modes are detected, and their driving frequencies andazimuthal wavenumbers mmeasured, in high-resolution imaging or stellar occultations by an orbiting spacecraft.",0
We show that a single detection of a low-wavenumber Uranus mode resonating in the rings could eliminate a large fraction of models.,0
"If all modes are presumed to have the same energy, the radial velocity signal is expected to be dominated by acoustic overtone (p) modes.",0
"P modes are trapped sound waves, and hence have special value for discriminating interior structure by virtue of probing the sound speed in the interior.",0
"These modeling efforts can be broadly separated into two categories, those built around physical equations of state (EOSs) on one hand, and empirical models informed weakly if at all by an EOS on the other.",0
"The former category (e.g., Nettelmann et al. ) emphasizes compatibility with experimental data and physical interpretability, including direct inferences about composition and temperature structure.",0
"For example, a homogeneous polytrope satisfying Uranus s mass, radius, spin, and J2requires n and implies a density at P= bar of 1= 4g cm , overestimating the density implied by Voyager radio occultation data by a factor of approximately (Lindal et al. ).",0
"A stably stratified water cloud may also host its own internal gravity waves, but the negligible amount of mass involved makes their observation unlikely.",0
"The intervening discontinuities in andc2 smodify the spectrum of f and p modes and also introduce interface modes, which stem from the gravitywave response to small displacements of an interface between two fluid layers of differing densities (Vorontsov et al. ).",0
"Gradient model : similarly to Fuller , we start with a simple reference polytrope of index nenvthat satisfies Uranus s mass and radius, designate the region < r < r ias the core region, and enhance the density there by a constant factor grad>.",0
"In the gradient model, the polytropic constant Kenv=P/ 1+/nenv of the underlying reference polytrope is adjusted during structure iterations such that the model converges to the desired total mass M=MUto a specified tolerance.",0
"pressure continuity at the interface relates the two polytropic constants ( Kenv, Kcore) and Kcoreis adjusted to achieve Uranus s total mass.",0
"Hence, we choose a total mass tolerance 5MUto yield a fractional frequency error less than %, safely smaller than the error introduced by our approximations concerning rotation (see Section below).",0
"Each iteration enforces the prescription for (r),c2 s(r) described above where rcorresponds to the mean radii of the isopotential surfaces.",0
"Constraining the density profile After Uranus s mass and equatorial radius, the primary constraint on interior structure is J2, which we fit directly by adjusting one of the parameters during ToF iterations (similar to, e.g., Militzer & Hubbard ).",0
We calculate the effectthat these jet streams have on the zonal gravity field by solving a thermo-gravitational wind equation (TGWE) model as in Mankovich et al. .,0
We treat Uranus s winds assuming the -bar level has wind speeds consistent with Voyager and Hubble data (per Soyuer et al. s fit; their Equation ) and apply a simple exponential decay as a function of radial distance from the -bar surface.,0
"Brunt-V ais al a frequency (dot-dashed, read on right axis) is plotted as a fraction of Uranus s dynamical frequency (Equation ).",0
"Given the small number of data being fit for our gravity-only samples, we naturally recover a highly degenerate posterior probability distribution.",0
Oscillation modes We solve the fourth-order system of ordinary differential equations describing the adiabatic oscillation modes using GYRE2(Townsend & Teitler ).,0
"We label the interface modes asm i, not to be confused with inertial modes (see Dewberry & Lai ; Friedson et al. ), which are limited to lower frequencies 2 Uand generally yield weaker gravity and radial velocity perturbations per unit mode energy compared to the modes considered in this paper.",0
"Gradient inner boundary radiusa(,) MCMC grad Core density enhancement factor ( ,) MCMC Kenv Reference polytrope proportionality constant Any Adjusted to fit total mass d Decay depth of jet streams, units Req (,) MCMC PU Bulk rotation period, h ( ,) MCMC Table .aThese quantities are specified as a fraction of the volumetric mean radius Rof the P= bar surface, which varies along with the oblateness from one model to the next.",0
"Our best information about the amplitude spectrum of normal modes in a giant planet comes from Saturn, where the amplitudes of ring waves excited by Saturn can be used to constrain the amplitudes of the perturbing modes (Hedman & Nicholson ; Afgibo & Hedman ).",0
We show in Appendix A that Uranus f modes can generate observable ring signatures if their nondimensional amplitudes areof the same order of magnitude as the Saturn f modes responsible for the waves observed in the C ring.,0
At these locations GYRE enforces jump conditions to guarantee continuity of the radial displacement and Lagrangian pressure perturbation.,0
"In models with rigid (non-oscillatory) cores, zero radial displacement is enforced at core boundary; otherwise, GYRE applies its default inner boundary condition imposing regularity of the eigenfunctions.",0
"At the surface of the model, GYRE applies boundary conditions on the Eulerian gravitational potential perturbation and the Lagrangian pressure perturbation that follow from the vanishing of the background density.",0
"The fundamental modes manifest the fact that if the planetary surface is perturbed locally, gravity acts as a restoring force and the disturbance propagates away as a wave.",0
"Compared to other types of modes, the radial phase coherence of f modes (no nodes as a function of radius; n= ) means that they produce intrinsically larger gravity perturbations for a fixed mode energy.",0
These are internal gravity waves restored by buoyancy; their existence hence requires stable stratification N2> somewhere in the interior.,0
"P modes hence propagate in the envelope outside a characteristic turning point where 2=S2 , at which point refraction from the increasing sound speed causes the wavevector to become purely horizontal and rays turn back toward the planetary surface.",0
P modes are oscillatory where their frequencies are greater than the Lamb frequency (thick dashed curve; see Equation ).,0
G modes are oscillatory where their frequencies are less than the BruntV ais al a frequency (thick solid curve; see Equation ).,0
Dotted regions are evanescent zones where mode amplitudes decay with distance from their wave propagation region but are still generally nonzero.,0
The grey shaded region at low frequency indicates the inertial frequency range <2 Uin which the Coriolis force becomes an important restoring force and our approximations regarding rotation (Section ) are no longer valid.,0
"The fact that N < S 2throughout the interior enforces a strict frequency hierarchy between g, f, and p modes in this case.",0
"Its frequency may be less than or comparable to the f mode frequency or even low-order p mode frequencies, depending on the properties of the interface (see Equation and Section ).",0
"This category includes Rossby and other inertial modes; these generally have smaller intrinsic gravitational perturbations than f/g/interface modes at fixed mode energy and so may be less amenable to detection in the rings, although they may have been detected in Saturn s C ring (Hedman et al. ; see Friedson et al. ).",0
"Each prograde Uranus mode with inertial frequency given by Equation has a pattern speed p, mn = mn/mwhich, fed into the OLR condition (see Mankovich et al.",0
"For f modes the interpretation is typically clear because their frequencies are well separated as a function of , per the f 1/2scaling of Equation .",0
"Rotational splitting (Equation ) and planetary structure also affect these frequencies, but rarely to the point of inducing confusion between successive m values for a given observation (see Figure in either Mankovich et al. or A Hearn et al. ).",0
"In these cases some guidance is providedby the tendency of higher modes to have shorter radial wavelengths, leading them to evanesce more rapidly between their wave propagation zones and the planetary surface.",0
"Furthermore, higher components of the perturbed gravitational potential decay more rapidly with radius in the vacuum exterior to the planet.",0
"It remains possible however that the processes responsible for mode excitation and damping could favor certain wavelengths (or values), confounding these simple expectations.",0

"Notably, these two scenarios happen to yield similar density profiles in Uranus: the rigid core models produce rcore= .040RU(mean and standard deviation) and the gradient models produce equivalent core radii ( ro+ri)/ = .",0
"Still other interpretations of the same data could produce more radically different solutions for Uranus s interior structure, but based on the relatively large gravitational potentials associated with f and n= g modes, we consider the two scenarios shown here to be the most likely.",0

"This can be understood as a result of a phase shift experienced by acoustic waves as they encounter the interface (Roxburgh & Vorontsov 1994a), introducing a periodic modulation into the mode frequencies whose period is controlled solely by the acoustic radius of the jump (see also Monteiro et al. ).",0

"Uranus s weak intrinsic flux might invite skepticism in this regard, but the possibility of a hot, convective interior insulated from the cold atmosphere by a thermal boundary (e.g., (Nettelmann et al. ; Leconte & Chabrier )) suggests that a large reservoir of fluid kinetic energy cannot be ruled out.",0

"We study the + flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field.",0
This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background s decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate.,0
"We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as t with < and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field.",0
The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.,0
"I. INTRODUCTION Domain wall networks have been thoroughly studied in the context of primordial cosmology, since such configurations generically form when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken and their presence can have dramatic consequences on the history of the early universe [ ].",0
"Numerous analytical [, ] and numerical [ ] studies have pointed out that domain wall networks reach a so-called scaling regime where their decay is governed by a power law i.e. where the energy stored in the domain wall network scales as t with > .",0
"It should be mentioned that there exist regimes (the so-called spinodal instability , or domain wall precursor , regime) where a full quantum treatment is possible [ ] but it is unclear to what extent this is relevant to realistic cosmological scenarios.",0
"In this work, we pursue a hybrid approach in which the domain wall network is treated as a classical field configuration (t, x) whose main decay channel is via particle-antiparticle pair production in a second field (t, x) treated quantum mechanically.",0
"We further assume a sine-Gordon potential V( ) cos for the broken symmetry field , along with a V( ) 2coupling to the quantum field .",0
The integrability properties of the sine-Gordon model in + dimensions ensure that the decay of the field configuration primarily occurs via quantum radiation of quanta.,0
[] where the scattering of one kink-antikink pair in the presence of quantum radiation was studied in detail and the outcome of the collision (annihilation or elastic scattering) was found to depend finely on the relative velocity.,0
"Here we will rather be interested in the time evolution of global properties such as the total energy of a kink-antikink ensemble, its kink number density or, the total radiated energy.",0
"Averaging over these distinct simulations yields a late time scaling law for the total energy in the kink-antikink background that seems to slightly disagree with the classical one, = , that is usually considered in the literature (see e.g. []).",0
IV with a discussion of the limitations and possible improvements of our results as well as their relevance to cosmology.,0
"We can use this class of exact solutions of the field equations for = to build the desired ensemble of nkink-antikink pairs by simply pasting together (at time t= say) nalternating kink and antikink profiles centered at positions xi(separated by distances larger than the typical kink width, |xi+ xi| /m), and with randomly generated velocities vi.",0
"In the absence of interactions with the quantum radiation field ( = ) the subsequent dynamics of the kinkantikink ensemble is given by the + -dimensional sine-Gordon equation +m2sin = , whose integrability properties ensure that the system s evolution reproduces a stable multiple-kink-antikink solution.",0
"Intuitively, non-negligible particle production in this channel will occur when the kink-antikink ensemble, acting as a dynamical background for the quantum field , ceases to be adiabatic, i.e., whenever a kink-antikink collision occurs.",0
This can be obtained by varying action with respect to and replacing any operator depending on the quantum field in the resulting field equation by a quantum expectation value.,0
"For arbitrary separations, one should use the corresponding analytical solution of the sine-Gordon equation, obtained by using the B acklund transform [].",0
"This is most readily accomplished in the Heisenberg picture where the quantum operator obeys the (linear) field equation + 2+ ( cos ) = , where (t, x) is treated as a given classical background.",0
"| (t, x)| using any of the tried and tested methods developed for computing particle production in time dependent backgrounds.",0
"In summary, we can find the semiclassically backreacted dynamics of the discretized system by numerically solving theN2ordinary differential equations for the quantum field already given in Eq.",0
In the next section we will use this method to investigate numerically how the quantum decay of a generic kink-antikink ensemble occurs.,0
"We then would build an initial kink-antikink ensemble configuration 0(x) as in , and finally evolve it by solving the coupled equations and with initial conditions given by and , respectively.",0
However we immediately get faced with the computational limitations of our setup since the algorithmic complexity scales with N2i.e.,0
"Initial profile of the renormalized average energy density in the quantum field , 0(x) = (t= , x), of which iis the discretized version.",0
"We use a position Verlet method [] with a time step dt=a/, which leads to total energy conservation with % accuracy for the duration of our time evolution.",0
"[], the implementation of the renormalization scheme makes our numerical results largely UVand IR-independent, i.e., insensitive to the choices of NandL. In this work, we are in particular interested in the time variation of the energy in the classical kink-antikink E E E tEnergy FIG. .",0
"Time evolution of the energy in the background (solid line), the renormalized energy in the quantum field (dashed line), as well their sum (dot-dashed dark blue line).",0
"(for the previous choice of parameters, = , = ) along with the (renormalized) energy in the quantum field , E =a 2Tr Z. Z Z. Z + 2 . Z.Z Z. Z  .",0
These expressions are somewhat ambiguous because in the presence of interactions there is no good way of defining the energy of a subsystem.,0
"However it is clear that both E andE reduce to the energy in and to the quantum average of the energy in (up to an additive constant) respectively, when = .",0
"Moreover, by using the field equations, we can readily check that the total energy, E=E +E is a conserved quantity (even when = ).",0
We therefore expect these definitions to correspond to the intuitive notions of energy of the classical background and energy in the quantum radiation at least for weak coupling and as long as the background stays classical.,0
"Much has been said about this topic in the literature [ ] but in this work we will adopt a naive criterion for classicality of : we will assume that as long as the energy in the excitations (i.e., the renormalized energy) is less than the energy in ,E E , the background can be treated classically and the semi-classical approximation holds.",0
"Since our numerical setup trades the full field theory for a system with finite degree of freedom system, we also would expect the radiated energy in to eventually return to the classical background.",0
"After a short initial phase during which E is approximately constant (before kink-antikink collisions start occurring), and during which E is negative (a sign that no real quanta are present), the decay of the classical background occurs approximately step-wise: for each kink-antikink collision, a real wavepacket is produced and emitted [], which leads to a sudden decrease in E (and a corresponding increase in E ).",0
"Time-evolution of the energy in the background E for an ensemble of n= kink-antikink pairs averaged over a sample of NS= different realizations, corresponding to different, randomly chosen, initial conditions.",0
"We notice that, as expected, the total energy of the system is conserved to a good approximation, which increases our confidence in the stability of our numerical calculations (see Appendix A for other consistency tests of our numerical methods).",0
"The idea is to then plot the average energy in the classical kink-antikink ensemble background, E , over all these realizations.",0
"Time evolution of the energy in the background E forn= (orange) and n= (dark blue) for three different samples of kink-antikink ensembles each: two independent samples of NS= realizations, and one sample with NS= realizations.",0
"Due to the limited size of our statistical sample (Ns= ), the computed value of the exponent has an associated uncertainty which can be estimated using the following equation = logEstart+ logEend logtend logtstart= Estart/Estart+ Eend/Eend logtend logtstart, where EstartandEendare the values of E at times tstartandtendrespectively.",0
"Moreover E is obtained by averaging over the Nsrealizations, so we can estimate Estartand Eendby the corresponding sample standard deviations divided by NS.",0
Notice that since E +E is constant the scaling parameter also controls the average rate of quantum particle production in the field at late times.,0
"Time-evolution of the energy in the background E for an ensemble of n= kink-antikink pairs averaged over a sample of NS= different realizations, for different values of the coupling .",0
"In particular, we notice from Fig. , for small values of coupling, , the energy lost by the background is negligible for the duration of our runs ( t= m ).",0
"In this work, we studied the dynamics of classical multiple kink-antikink configurations of a field in + dimensions coupled to a quantum field .",0
The non-adiabaticity resulting from the collision of kink-antikink pairs result in the excitation of the quantum field and thus produce quantum radiation.,0
Our main goal was to quantify the rate of quantum decay of the background at late times and investigate whether a scaling regime sets in.,0
The full quantum problem including the effects of backreaction of the quantum field on the classical background was tackled by discretizing the field theory model and using the semiclassical approximation.,0
"Time-evolution of the energy in the background E for an ensemble of n= kink-antikink pairs averaged over a sample of NS= different realizations, for different values of the quantum field mass .",0
we show the time evolution of the energies in the background ( E ) and the quantum field ( E ) starting from this initial configuration.,0
"As can be seen in the figure, the decay does not occur in a smooth way since there are only kink-antikink pairs and every time a pair annihilates there is a noticeable jump in the energy.",0
"In order to be able to identify a scaling regime for the late time quantum decay of the kink-antikink ensemble, one would need to consider configurations with a large number of pairs and be able to evolve them for a long enough time.",0
"It is important to mention here that we cannot strictly trust the simulations after the background has lost more than half its initial energy because by that time the assumption that the background is classical presumably ceases to be true, and the semi-classical approximation breaks down.",0
The above limitation becomes particularly clear when investigating how the scaling exponent depends on the coupling or the mass of the quantum field.,0
"Of course a much more interesting setting would be to study the quantum annihilation of domain wall networks in higher dimensions ( + or + ), but this would be even more computationally intensive and would require parallelization.",0
For typical runaway bubble walls (Lorentz factor ) this energy can be large and in the presence of a sufficiently large coupling with dark matter can produce SHDM with the correct relic abundance.,0
"Analogously to the current work, the classical kink-antikink ensemble background could be extended to an ultra-relativistic domain wall or bubble wall network, and the quantum particles would correspond to the SHDM candidate.",0
"Although further investigations are necessary, the toy model discussed here could thus be interpreted as a proof of concept for the full physically relevant simulation where generically classical decay due to self-annihilation will compete with the quantum decay mode studied in this work.",0

"Non-Gaussianities in Collider Metric Binning Andrew J. Larkoski American Physical Society, Hauppauge, New York , USA (Dated: March , ) Metrics for rigorously defining a distance between two events have been used to study the properties of the dataspace manifold of particle collider physics.",0
"The probability distribution of pairwise distances on this dataspace is unique with probability , and so this suggests a method to search for and identify new physics by the deviation of measurement from a null hypothesis prediction.",0
"To quantify the deviation statistically, we directly calculate the probability distribution of the number of event pairs that land in the bin a fixed distance apart.",0
This distribution is not generically Gaussian and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean entries in a bin scales inversely with the square-root of the number of events in the data ensemble.,0

"[] effectively isolates three-particle correlations from iterated two-particle correlations in each event individually, and then averages over events.",0
"While such a measure of higher-point correlations is useful and informative, it is rather distinct from what is measured on the cosmic microwave backlarkoski@aps.orgground.",0
"As close as possible analogously, we would like to measure non-Gaussianities on the universe of particle collider events, from multi-point correlations between entire events themselves.",0
This approach requires a robust definition of distances between events because the space on which particle collider data live is extremely high dimensional and varies event-by-event.,0
"Additionally, because collider event data is continuous-valued and drawn from some continuous distribution, there are general proofs that the probability distribution of pairwise distances between events, or the distribution of two-point event correlations, is unique with unit probability [].",0
"This analysis will be completely general, but we will consider specific motivated examples from particle collider physics to illustrate our results.",0
"on coordinate space according to some distribution pE. In our collider physics context, this would be particle momentum phase space, and we denote individual points on this space corresponding to a complete event and the momentum of all of its constituent particles as x.",0
"Further, the contribution to the variance from such nonGaussianities scales like n3in the large number of events nlimit, while the mean only scales like n2.",0
"As such, we generically expect that non-Gaussianities dominate the variance with fixed bin width and large number of events n. In this the case, the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean scales like n /, lim n N n /.",0
"Intriguingly, even though the number of pairs that contributes to the distance distribution is proportional to n2, the distances are correlated and this correlation reduces the relative scaling of the standard deviation to be exactly as expected from Poissonian statistics of ni.i.d.",0
"In that case, this implies that the dataspace exhibits some enhanced symmetry at the distance scale so that the probability is unchanged by translation from point xto another point on the space.",0

"Comparing the transmission spectrum with atmospheric models that incorporate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects suggests that the planetary mass is likely between to MJ, much lighter than the upper limit previously derived from radial velocity measurements.",0

"In this paper, we present new time-resolved detections of the infrared Ca iitriplet lines, taking advantage of the wider wavelength coverage of GHOST and the increased SNR provided by the m mirror of Gemini South.",0
"Since the blue arm of GHOST covers wavelengths relatively devoid of strong telluric lines, the blue and red spectra were joined together to produce one telluric model per exposed phase; the data were cut at A and the blue spectra were scaled to the same level as the red by matching the medians of the last blue flux values to the first red flux values.",0
"This is justified given that both detectors were configured to start and end each exposure simultaneously, thus covering the same time interval and airmass range.",0
The resulting molecfit model was interpolated back onto the original wavelength grid of the separate blue/red spectra and divided out to remove the telluric contamination.,0
"We accounted for Doppler shifts due to Earth s barycentric radial velocity and the systemic velocity, but not the stellar radial velocity due to the uncertainty in the mass of HAT-Pb and the fact that it is a rapidly rotating star with broad spectral lines.",0
"Correcting for this would require a model that simultaneously accounts for the planet s atmosphere and the wavelength-dependent RM effect (e.g. Dethier & Bourrier ), which is beyond the scope of this work.",0
"Using Equation from Langeveld et al. , the measured absorption depths ( ) from Table can be converted to relative atmospheric heights (normalized to Rp) at which most of the absorption occurs.",0
i.e. the radius of the planet at this wavelength appears to be % larger than than the white-light planetary radius due to the absorption occurring within the atmosphere.,0

We do not analyze the CaiiH and K lines in this initial study with GHOST due to the spectrograph focusing issue and the bluest wavelengths suffering from low SNR.,0
"Moreover, the measured mass of HAT-Pb is only an upper limit (Zhou et al. ), so it is possible for the planet to have a lower mass, which in turn would lower Time-Resolved Transmission Spectroscopy of HAT-Pb the bulk density and decrease the atmospheric pressure for the same altitude.",0
"Using this framework, we created six NLTE atmospheric models: three with constant Ca abundance ( solar) but varying planetary mass (the MJupper limit, MJ, and 1MJ); and three with constant planetary mass ( MJ) but varying Ca abundance ( , , and solar).",0
"Figure shows a comparison of these NLTE models to the observed Ca iitriplet lines in the combined transmission spectrum, with the constant abundance models in the top panels and the constant mass on the bottom.",0
"For the constant abundance models, it is clear that MJis not a realistic mass for HAT-Pb, since the observed absorption lines are significantly deeper than simulated.",0
"Therefore, it is likely that the true mass of HAT-Pb lies somewhere in between these values comparable to the mass of other UHJs that also show strong absorption features (e.g. WASPb, WASPb, WASPb).",0
", we fixed the mass to 2MJto investigate if a super-solar abundance could deepen the absorption and provide a closer match to the observations.",0

"In this model the energy associated with the -component is independent of the number of layers, , therefore it is associated with a contribution coming from the surface of the film (i.e., the first and last layers) .",0
"Additionally, it is noted that the coexistence of superconductivity with a different order parameter, such as charge density waves, does not alter the fundamental framework of our phenomenological model.",0
",, Notably, previous tunneling investigations were conducted at temperatures of K , mK20 and below mK , , whereas our experiment was conducted at = K. This suggests that the observed transition may be a distinct feature of intermediate temperature regime .",0
"While tunneling experiments have also been conducted at = K, these were limited to bulk crystals, where suppression of surface states is significant.",0
"It is also important to highlight that tunneling experiments using STM cannot fully encapsulate the sample, as the top surface must remain expos ed.",0
Our experimental study suggests that encapsulating the sample with hBN on both surfaces might be crucial to prevent degradation and enabling measurement of the intrinsic properties of the sample or to strain the NbSe as discussed above.,0
"This limitation could be addressed through device -based tunneling experiments, where the top tunneling electrode is deposited on a thin hBN layer.",0
Future SOT measurements at millikelvin temperatures will be necessary to directly compare these results with tunneling experiments.,0
"Thirdly, measurements are sensitive to the order parameter only near the critical temperature, making it impossible to probe transition s occurring at intermediate temperatures as in our experiment .",0
"Specifically , irrespective of the theoretical framework, our experimental methodology serves as a powerful tool for detecting surface superconductivity and the concurrent suppression of bulk superconductivity.",0
"The utility of Pearl -length measurements extends beyond this investigation, as they serve as a sensitive tool for probing the superconducting nature of thin films under various experimental conditions, such as elastic strain, electric field perturbations, or alterations in temperatur e.",0
This approach aimed to prevent degradation of the samples and maintain their integrity throughout the experimental process.,0
"Additionally, the larger diameter causes lower period of the quantum interference pattern of the SQUID critical current versus applied field.",0
"To initiate the experimental process, we applied small mT magnetic fields to induce the creation of multiple vortices within the sample.",0

Chestnut St., Chicago, IL , USA ABSTRACT Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels.",0
"Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range.",0
"Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.",0
We aim to gain more insight into BBH astrophysics by using population synthesis simulations to predicted the observed population.,0
"These simulations model the evolution of BBH progenitors, predicting the resulting observable parameters of sources for different input astrophysics and formation scenarios, which will we refer to as hyperparameters.",0
"ML has been used in various aspects of GW data analysis in order to increase efficiency of dataquality improvement, waveform modelling, searches and parameter estimation (Cuoco et al. ).",0
The interpolation may either be done by reconstructing the probability distribution across different input hyperparameters given a set of observations (Delfavero et al. ) or by emulating how the astrophysical population varies across hyperparameter space.,0
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to emulate populations, training the DNNs on kernel density estimation (KDE) reconstructions of the population (Mould et al. ) or binned distributions (Riley & Mandel ).",0
Normalising flows are a type of generative machine learning algorithm which can model complicated probConstraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows ability densities; they are therefore well suited to this problem.,0
"Applications of normalising flows to population inference problems have given fast and accurate results for population analyses of stellar mass BBHs (Wong et al. , 2021b,a), super massive BBHs (Laal et al. ), and studies of other stellar populations (Hon et al. ).",0
"Population Models We consider five formation channels: three isolated channels (common envelope, chemically homogeneous evolution, stable mass transfer); and two dynamical cluster environments (globular clusters and nuclear star clusters).",0
"The common-envelope (CE) channel describes stellar binaries that, after one compact object has already formed, undergo unstable mass transfer leading to an envelope of the donor star s material surrounding the compact object and the donor s core.",0
"Drag forces from the envelope cause the system to harden, and the envelope is ejected with some efficiency, CE(van den Heuvel ; Paczynski ; Belczynski et al. ; Dominik et al. ).",0
"This efficiency is the fraction of orbital energy used to eject the envelope, where a value of CE greater than requires energy other than orbital energy, such as radiative energy from the stellar objects, to be used in the envelope s ejection (Ivanova et al. ).",0
"For the stable mass transfer (SMT) channel, binaries undergo only stable mass transfer during their evolution (van den Heuvel et al.",0
"Andrews et al. ): COSMIC population synthesis (Breivik et al. ) up until the end of the second mass-transfer episode, and the detailed stellar evolution code MESA (Paxton et al. , , , , ) from the formation of a BH helium star binary until the formation of the second BH.",0
"In the globular cluster (GC) and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, binaries undergo dynamical scatterings and captures due to their dense formation environments (Heggie ; Fitchett ; Antonini & Rasio ).",0
"NSCs are generally more massive than GCs, thus their higher escape velocities mean that they can retain more black hole merger remnants, and have a significant fraction of hierarchical mergers.",0
These weights account for the probability of binary formation at particular metallicities and the increasing co-moving volume probed at higher redshift.,0
"Each simulation predicts the set binary observables : the chirp mass M, mass ratio q=m2/m1(where m2is the less massive black hole component mass and m1is the more massive black hole component mass, such that q ), effective inspiral spin eff, and redshift zat which the BBH merges.",0
Evaluating the probability of the population models in the tails of the distribution therefore does not give a reliable estimate of the true probability of BBH formation in these regions.,0
"We start with a uniform prior where we have no samples to inform our result, and as we increase the number of population synthesis samples N, we place increasing weight in the population model probability ppop( | ).",0
"In parts of parameter space where there are many samples, the probability p( | ) is approximately equal to the population model probability ppop( | ), but in the tails of the distribution, we tend towards an uniformative uniform distribution.",0
"Normalising flows Normalising flows are a class of generative neural networks that are trained to find the optimal mapping between a complicated distribution and a simple latent space through a series of transformations, allowing emulation of the more complex distribution (Papamakarios et al.",0
"As we have samples from these distributions, but not the probabilities over -space, normalising flows give us a way to directly evaluate these probability distributions.",0
"The log likelihood ratio between the normalising flow and the KDE representation of the CE population model with b= and CE= , at a slice through chirp mass and mass ratio at effective inspiral spin of .",0
"The top panel shows no regularisation applied to the normalising flow or the KDE, with the likelihood ratio at the most extreme in the tails of the probability distribution.",0
"The populations with highest CEcorrespond to populations with the lowest masses and greatest redshifts, hence the lowest detection efficiency.",0
"Wong et al. (2021a) found a weak preference for low CE, using mass and redshift observations to constrain a population made up of a mixture of binaries from isolated evolution and globular clusters.",0
"Updated prescriptions for the CE phase (e.g., Hirai & Mandel ) may benefit our constraints on the inference of CE astrophysics.",0
"These populations contribute to the lower masses and effective inspiral spins close to b, and therefore may be harder to distinguish than the other channels with our observations. .",0
"This used a power-law-plus-peak model in primary mass (Talbot & Thrane ), a power law in mass ratio, an identical beta distribution for both spin magnitudes, a mixture of isotropic and normally distributed spin tilts, and a power law in redshift.",0
"While the CE and SMT channels are the primary con-tributors to the population between M M , the higher chirp mass tail is from hierarchical mergers in the dynamical formation channels, GC and NSC.",0
Our results support the notion that the underlying BBH population has contributions to the high mass population from dynamical channels (Kimball et al.,0
The distribution from the parametric result peaks at smaller masses than our result; this is a consequence of a minimum chirp mass of .3M in the population synthesis models we consider.,0
"The CE channel is the only channel than can contribute to the population for M .5M , as the other channels do not have chirp masses this low.",0
"As lower mass BBHs make up the majority of the underlying population, this drives the underlying branching fraction for the CE channel to be high.",0
"While the power-law model peaks at q= , we find a flatter distribution above q , with an excess of mergers in the range q and a dearth of mergers at symmetric mass ratios compared to the power-law model.",0
"Our results are similar to those found by Godfrey et al. , who use a data-driven model to infer the distributions of BBHs in GWTC-, finding a flatter distribution of mass ratios between q and q= .",0
"Similarly, Rinaldi et al. find a mass ratio distribution which does not show support for equal mass binaries, instead the main contribution being centred around q .",0
The results from Callister & Farr also infer a mass ratio distribution that either peaks at q= or is flat in mass ratio.,0
"While the parametric power law model is limited to a monotonic function of mass ratio, these data-driven models identify alternative structure in the data.",0
"This raises the question whether BBHs do preferentially merge with equal masses (Fishbach & Holz ), or if this is driven by assumptions in the power law model.",0
"Our results add to the evidence that the mass ratio distribution of BBHs does not peak at q= , motivating the investigation of alternative parametric models for this distribution.",0
"Compared to the parametric models, our inferred population has a greater contribution at higher chirp masses, mass ratios around .",0
"In general, our framework can be used to find the region of highest (and lowest) probability for population synthesis input hyperparameters, and determine interesting locations for further simulations.",0
"We find that our inferred population shows more structure in the distributions of chirp mass, mass ratio and effective inspiral spin than current results using parametric population models (Abbott et al. ).",0
"A similar approach could be implemented in our framework, extending our implementation of neural networksto interpolate the detection efficiency, making our results more reliable.",0

"With growing cold plasma magnetization 0, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases.",0
"Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.",0
"In recent years, kinetic plasma simulations have provided first-principles insight into the mechanisms of particle acceleration in turbulent astrophysical environments by uncovering the nature of particledynamicsovertheirentireaccelerationhistory[ ].",0
"It was shown that particles can be rapidly injected from the thermal pool into the suprathermal population by nonideal electric fields near reconnecting current sheets [,,,].",0
"This can be seen as a generalization of the second-order Fermi process [ ,,,], which involves diffusion in energy space.",0
"However, most kinetic simulations to date face a significant shortcoming: they lack a genuine steady state, due to the fact that the simulation domains employed are of finite size and closed, which leads to a progressive accumulation of energy over time and to the pile-up of particles at the highest energies [ ].",0
"Moreover, it is known that power-law distributions emerge most naturally from a competition between particle acceleration and escape.",0
"In this Letter, we develop an efficient method for achieving steady state in kinetic plasma-turbulence simulations in open domains, and we characterize the emerging steadystate statistics of particle acceleration and escape.",0
"The particle distributions exhibit nonthermal power laws extending up to the system size(Hillas) limit, where the rate of diffusive particle escape reaches the theoretical maximum (set by the light-crossing time).",0
"In our simulations, the nonthermal energy fraction of escaping particles grows with the cold plasma magnetization 0(defined below) and saturates near % at 0 .",0
We perform 3D simulations of kinetic plasma turbulence with particle injection and escape using the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code Tristan-MP v2[].,0
"Particles escape the magnetized turbulent accelerator by diffusing over a distance lescperpendicular to the mean magnetic field B0=B0 z, while at the same time new thermal particles are introduced into the domain from the external heat reservoir.",0
"In order to keep the total number of particles fixed, we insert a new thermal particle (sampled from a Maxwellian at temperature T0) at the location of every escaping particle.",0
"Employing for simplicity an electron positron composition ( me =me+=m) of mean number density n0, we explore the effect of different cold plasma magnetizations 0=B2 /(4 n0mc2)on particle acceleration and escape.",0
"We set T0=mc2[ 0( + 0)]/[ + 0], which ensures that the mean energy of the injected particles E0 mc2 0is close to the expected steady-state mean particle energy (see Eq. below).",0
Our simulations presented in the following show that large-amplitude kinetic turbulence with particle escape settles into a state where the average kinetic and magnetic pressures are of the same order.,0
"A supporting analytical argument can be provided by considering the balance between turbulent energization and energy losses from particle escape: (Eesc E0)n0/tesc b2B2 /(4 t0), where Eescis the mean energy of escaping particles, tescis the escape time, and t0is the turbulence cascade time.",0

"(b) we show the fraction of particles and of the kinetic energy contained in nonthermal (i.e., nonMaxwellian) particles.",0
"Therefore, our results show that strongly magnetized turbulent accelerators can release a large fraction of the dissipated power into escaping cosmic rays (i.e., into nonthermal particles).",0
At 0 the escaping cosmic rays amount to about % of the particles leaving the box and they carry away % of the dissipated turbulence power.,0
"In strongly magnetized turbulence, particles can be injected into the nonthermal population via nonideal electric fields at reconnecting current sheets [ ].",0
"Following the reconnection scenario, we can estimate the fraction of nonthermal particles ntfrom the expected rate of reconnection in relativistic plasmas [ ].",0
"For a cold plasma upstream of the reconnection layer [ ],Sis given by the following nonlinear equation []: S2= [ + m/]( + S2)/( S2) [ + m/]{ + ( m/)( S2)/( +S2)}/, where m 0( S2)/( +S2)is the microscale magnetization parameter, and we took half of the asymptotic X-line kinetic pressure to obtain the above formula [ ].",0
"Assuming that an order-unity fraction of particles reprocessed by reconnection is injected into the acceleration process, we finally estimate the nonthermal fraction as nt rec.",0
"[], and we obtain the energy-diffusion coefficient asDEE(E) = E(t) / t, where E(t) = E( t) E(t ), t=t t lesc/c, and the angular brackets represent an average over all particles in a given energy bin.",0
"We define the escape time based on the energydependent flux of escaping particles (e.g., [ ]) as tesc= f(E)/ fesc(E), where fesc(E)is the number of particles leaving the box per unit of energy and per unit time.",0
"We observe that this limit is approximately reached at the highest energies, corresponding to the Hillas limit, which reflects the fact that the highestenergy particles are not confined by the accelerator and thus escape via ballistic motion.",0
"Our novel approach has potential applications to a variety of moderately to strongly magnetized astrophysical objects, such as pulsar wind nebulae [ ], jets from supermassive black holes [ ], and accretion disks in active galactic nuclei [ ].",0
We have demonstrated the formation of steady-state nonthermal particle distributions featuring extended power-law tails reaching the system size (Hillas) limit.,0
"Our numerical experiments also show that strongly magnetized turbulent accelerators can release a large fraction of the dissipated power into escaping cosmic rays, which can then feedback on the ambient medium.",0
"Such a large amount of energy contained in the nonthermal tail might provide nonlinear feedback on the turbulent cascade itself [ ]; contrary to expectations, we do not observe any significant modification of the turbulence spectrum in our simulations, and this aspect warrants further investigation.",0

"Functional methods, which are successfully used to calculate spectra of baryons and mesons, see, e.g., [, ], were only recently able to catch up with lattice methods and provide a concise spectrum of pure glueballs with quantum numbers J= ,,,,P= and C= [, ].",0
The kernels of the bound state equations can be derived in the same truncation and lead to one-particle exchange diagrams and one-loop diagrams.,0
"Finally, we test the dependence of these glueball masses on variations of the input in form of available solutions that differ only in the low momentum regime.",0
"The 3PI effective action In general, solving bound state Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSEs) requires input in terms of propagators and vertices.",0
These can be determined from the underlying tower of functional equations of the theory as given by a set of Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) (or thefunctional renormalization group).,0
"To distinguish the two equations, we will refer to them as the gluon and ghost BSEs, respectively, but it should be noted that they jointly describe a glueball.",0
"Such derivatives lead to many diagrams, but using the equations of motion of the three-point functions [, ], they can be resummed resulting in the diagrams shown in Fig. .",0
"Second, due to the aforementioned resummation, the one-particle exchange diagrams in the kernels have both vertices dressed in contrast to only one dressed vertex in a ladder type truncation.",0
"The corresponding equations of motion (EOM) for these correlation functions correspond to stationarity conditions of the 3PI effective action with respect to the desired correlation function [, , ].",0
"The resulting 3PI EOMs are very similar in structure to DSEs, which are equations of motion derived from the 1PI effective action.",0

"In the three-loop truncation used here, the propagator equations indeed are equal for 1PI and 3PI except for the four-gluon vertex which can be dressed in the former and is bare in the latter.",0
"For three-point functions, the three-loop truncation of the 3PI effective action restricts the diagrams in the equations to one-loop, whereas the DSEs can have two-loop diagrams.",0
"Further details are discussed in the review article [], which also offers a graphical representation of the corresponding equations.",0
", the glueball bound state equations probe four different (nonperturbative) correlation functions: the gluon and ghost propagators as well as the three-gluon and ghost-gluon vertices.",0
"These are determined from the equations of motion of the 3PI effective action truncated at three loops, see the discussion above.",0
Propagators The propagators are the simplest correlation functions in terms of kinematics and tensor structures as they only depend on one momentum and have (in Landau gauge) only one dressing function each.,0

"In [, , ], the vertex was included as a dynamic quantity into a larger system of equations, leading to decent agreement with lattice results, as, for example, from [, ].",0
"However, later explicit calculations showed the vertex dressing to deviate from one which are in turn relevant when the vertex appears in other equations; see, e.g. [ ], for early results.",0
we compare two different setups: the functional results displayed were obtained once from the equation of motion for the ghost-gluon vertex derived from the 3PI effective action and solved together with corresponding equations for all other correlation functions and once with the EOM for the ghost-gluon vertex replaced by the 1PI DSE variant.,0
"It has been shown to be dominated by the tree-level tensor while the dressings of the other three tensors are heavily suppressed [, ].",0
"Results for glueball ground states and excited states for the indicated quantum numbers from lattice simulations [, ] and functional equations [, ].",0
"Such functions, namely the two-ghosttwo-gluon and four-ghost vertices, do not appear directly in the 3PI equations of motion, but their effects are encoded in higher loop terms.",0
"Using a single kinematic configuration, all of these tensors were calculated in [] and subsequently their effect was tested for the ghost-gluon, three-gluon and four-gluon vertices.",0
"Hence, the inclusion of such four-point functions in DSEs, or equivalently the corresponding higher loop diagrams in equations of motion from the 3PI effective action, is not expected to be relevant at the current level of precision and within the employed kinematic approximation.",0
"However, it should be noted that not only do such vertices appear differently in FRG equations due their inherent one-loop structure with only dressed vertices, but they also can have different effects there [].",0
"They then contain (nonperturbative) one-particle exchange and one-loop diagrams, see Fig. , leading to oneand two-loop diagrams in the BSEs, respectively.",0

"We observe a sizeable shift in the eigenvalue curves at space-like momenta, which results in extrapolated masses at time-like momenta differing by about MeV for the scalar glueball ground state and by about MeV for the excited state.",0

The largest effect was seen for the scalar glueball mass and of the order of % and hence well below the general error of the extrapolation procedure.,0
"Family of solutions and gauge invariance As explained in Sec. , the DSEs of Yang-Mills theory are solved by a one-parameter family of correlation functions.",0
"Since these couplings provide direct information about the interaction strength in the kernels of the BSE, it is a very interesting and nontrivial question whether different solutions from this family also lead to different glueball masses.",0
"These are, however, not gauge invariant and therefore only the extrapolated masses provide a meaningful estimate of the physical equivalence of the different solutions.",0
"To test this further, we also calculated the glueball masses with mixed input, viz., we used propagators and vertices from different members of the family of solutions.",0

The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions.,0

"Despite its simplicity, the Z2LGT coupled to matter in one spatial dimension shows signatures of confinement [ ] in one spatial dimension, reminiscent of confinement of quarks in quantum chromodynamics.",0

"In analogy to the Higgs sector, the first, second, and third terms represent the electric field energy, the gauge invariant kinetic energy, and the local self-interaction of the bosonic Higgs field, respectively.",0
"In addition to bosonic particle number conservation, this Hamiltonian possesses a local gauge symmetry which we fix to , ( ) , += in analogy to the physical Gauss law constraint in electrodynamics in the absence of background charges, see Fig.",0

"Indeed, we numerically find from our DMRG simulations that decays exponentially for long distances for all >0studied, indicating that single particles are confined for all non-zero field strengths, analogous to the hard-core boson case [ ].",0

"Strikingly, this state, reminiscent of the W-like state that emerges in the attractive Bose-Hubbard-model [ ,], has superextensive energy 2.",0
"In a grand-canonical setting, a state with superextensive energy is not a stable phase of matter because the energy cost can never counterbalance the chemical potential cost and therefore, infinitely many particles are pulled out of the reservoir [ ] (see End Matter).",0
"Therefore, for sufficiently large , the state should qualitatively change when the on-site interaction repulsion energy exceeds the pair hopping and attraction energy.",0
"For large , we find all system sizes to converge quickly, as expected from a typical many-body state with extensive energy.",0
"By contrast, for small , we find the energy density to increase linearly with system size, in agreement with the expectation from the bunching state.",0
"In this case, perturbative pair hopping is still favored, but with an amplitude which is reduced due to the higher energy cost of the intermediate state induced by .",0
"From this simple model, we expect that the state of the pairs is that of weakly-repulsive hopping particles, i.e. a superfluid.",0
"By contrast, the single-particle correlator decays exponentially, with a coherence length that increases as 2 , but does not diverge.",0
"As clearly visible from both the superfluid density and the two-particle correlator, the state of the system changes dramatically around 2 .",0
"We find that the superfluid density vanishes as and that the two-particle correlator decreases exponentially with distance, with a correlation length that diverges as 2 from below.",0
"In the canonical ensemble, a vanishing compressibility results in a finite energy cost to add a single particle to the system.",0

"The gauge constraint in Eq. then forces the fields into a N eel state, such that the overall ground state is given by| .",0
"The gauge constraint enforces that only evenparity boson states are allowed, all of which are degenerate in this regime.",0
"However, we have already established that the single-particle correlator always decays exponentially, which excludes a true long-range correlated state.",0
This indicates that single particles are mobile over short distances and that states that have single occupancies on some sites make up a large fraction of the ground state.,0
"[ ], where single particles coexist with nearest-neighbor mesons, we call this phase a plasma due to its strong similarities to an electromagnetic plasma, where ions and electrons are deconfined over short distances.",0

"For small pair/ , the value of where this finite-size crossover occurs can, however, be large such that the bunching can prevail to experimentally relevant scales.",0
"Numerically, a more in-depth study of the bunching phase using DMRG simulations is, however, challenging because of its macroscopic local particle number fluctuations, thus requiring large local Hilbert space dimensions.",0
"Therefore, quantum simulators using native bosonic degrees of freedom such as trapped ions [ ], circuit QED [ ], and cold atoms in optical lattices [ ] might be ideally suited to answer these questions.",0

The question about the stability of matter [ ] is best formulated in a grand-canonical setting in which there is an infinite particle reservoir.,0
"Stability means that the ground state of the system has a finite energy and a finite number of particles, or in other words, that there is a finite number of particles at which the energy difference between the cost of creating another particle (or a pair of particles) and the interaction energy is positive.",0
"Therefore, the ground state of such a system would be a state with infinitely many particles and an infinite amount of energy would have been absorbed by the environment.",0
"Therefore, if the energy is negative, then it must be extensive, i.e. =, because in that case, there is a such that / > , meaning that the chemical potential does what we expect it to: determine how many particles there are in the system.",0

"In single stars, magnetic braking slows rotation, but in close binaries, tidal forces synchronize rotation, leading to high spin rates.",0
This is a result of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and mass taken by stellar winds and causes a change in the angular momentum of the wind compared to that of the stellar surface.,0
"Although the total angular momentum is conserved in close binaries, to first approximation, those systems are subject to mutual tidal forces that distort their stellar shape, breaking their spherical and axial symmetry.",0
"The theory of tidal circularization and synchronization suggests that tidal torque can be decomposed into two different components: Equilibrium Tides This force results from a nonwavelike, quasi-hydrostatic tidal bulge.",0
"Dynamical Tides Describes the excitation and damping of gravity (g) waves in the radiative zones due to perturbations of the spherical mass distribution of the stars, caused by tidal potential (Zahn ; Savonije & Papaloizou ; Goodman & Dickson ; Ogilvie ).",0
"For other stellar parameters (effective temperature, radius, mass, metallicity), We used the catalog published in Berger et al. .",0
One way to test this separation line is by using a sample of known non-single stars; we expect the probability of being below the line to be higher for non-single stars compared to general stars.,0
"Moreover, since we know that short-period binaries are synchronized, we expect the probability of non-single stars with short orbital periods to be even higher.",0
"We see that we get the expected results the known non-single stars have a much higher probability to be found below the critical line than the general sample of stars, and the probability for synchronized non-single is even higher and reaching % for K and G stars.",0
"Therefore, an additional light contribution from a MS companion is expected to increase with an increased mass of the companion.",0
"Since the measurements of stellar mass might be biased in the case of binarity, instead of using the measured mass from Berger et al. , we calculated the main sequence single star mass ( Mmss) from the temperature using mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations of L M4 andR M0.8respectively.",0
"This assumes that the majority of stars are single stars, which aligns with observations of binary fraction (Raghavan et al. ); moreover, even for binary stars, systems in which the secondary is of much lower mass would contribute little and appear almost as a single star.",0
"Tokovinin et al. analyzed solar-type spectroscopic binaries and found that the probability of having a third companion is strongly dependent on the orbital period, reaching % for binaries with Porb< days.",0
"Stability is given by the ratio of the semi-major axis, which can be converted to the ratio of periods using Kepler s third law, and accounting for the stellar masses.",0
"moves the systems above the critical separation line, even within the period errors, i.e. their hosts are possibly more massive stars which could be fast-spinning even without being in a synchronized binary.",0
"For example, Knud-strup et al. analyzed exoplanets and required a R < and Mp>.3MJ, where MJis Jupiter mass, for tidal obliquity alignment.",0
"The reason is that massive planets can affect the process of Kozai-Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF), which is possibly responsible for the creation of short-period binaries.",0
"Non-massive planets would not affect KLCTF, but this implies one of the following options either the planet is unstable, or it is sufficiently wide and has a high inclination with respect to the inner binary (for KLCTF to be possible).",0
"We further explain the last point; to check the possibility that the identified binary is a triple system with an inner unidentified binary and outer companion, we checked the stability criteria for such systems using the algebraic criteria given in Vynatheya et al. .",0
We assumed an equal mass ratio among all three companions and zero inclination between the outer companion and the inner binary.,0
"Using these simplified assumptions, we were able to calculate the stability for each sample using equation in Vynatheya et al. .",0

"Equivalently, P(Y > y |F) = F(y) almost surely for all y R. That is, given that we have issued Fas our forecast, the outcome Yshould arise according to the distribution F. Tsyplakov refers to this as auto-calibration of the forecast F. More generally, calibration could be defined with respect to an arbitrary -algebra.",0

"Auto-calibration: Conformal binning While CM conformal predictive systems satisfy probabilistic calibration guarantees, Theorem demonstrates that predictive systems with stronger calibration guarantees could be obtained from more strongly calibrated distributional regression procedures.",0
"Hence, from Theorem , by choosing any binning of the covariate-observation pairs, we can construct a predictive system that is guaranteed to contain an auto-calibrated predictive distribution.",0
"If it is possible to calculate the distance between elements in X, then the covariates can be binned using clustering methods.",0

"The following theorem demonstrates that the expected thickness of the conformal IDR predictive system is bounded above, and that this bound tends to zero as nincreases.",0
"Conformal IDR has an expected thickness less than or equal to 14n /, that is, E( u[ , X n+](y) [ , X n+](y)) 14n /, y R. Our proof also yields a lower bound on the expected thickness of conformal IDR of n /.",0
"The current proof uses a bound of n /(Dimitriadis et al., , Lemma ) that holds for every realization of isotonic regression when the response is binary, and under no conditions on the data generating process.",0
"In the machine learning literature, several methods have been proposed to go beyond quantifying only first-order probabilities, and seek to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty (Kendall and Gal, ; Abdar et al., ).",0
"This interpretation is justified by the consistency of IDR: Using the notation of Theorem , the unachievable target Ghn+1X j=1 (Xj,Yj), Xn+1i converges to the isotonic conditional law L Y| A Hhn+1X j=1 (Xj,Yj), Xn+1i , and the thickness of the predictive system is exclusively due to the fact that we do not have the observation Yn+.",0
"The thickness (corresponding to epistemic uncertainty) goes to zero with n (Theorem ), whereas even in the limiting case, given Xn+, there is still (aleatoric) uncertainty about which value the realization of Yn+1will take.",0
"While conformal IDR and the conformal binning approach are threshold calibrated by construction, the least squares prediction machine also appears threshold calibrated here, suggesting that the conditional variance of temperature does not depend on the forecast.",0
"The conditional variance of the outcome depends on the value of the covariate, which is not handled well by CM conformal predictive systems.",0
"We therefore find, in both simulated and real data examples, that when the conditional variance of the target variable depends on the covariate, significant improvements in forecast performance can be obtained using conformal binning or conformal IDR.",0

"ANTIMATTER GRAVITY AND THE RESULTS OF THE ALPHAG EXPERIMENT Massimo Villata INAF, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino, IPino Torinese (TO), Italy massimo.villata@inaf.it ABSTRACT By combining general relativity and CPT symmetry, the theory of CPT gravity predicts gravitational repulsion between matter and CPT-transformed matter, i.e. antimatter inhabiting an inverted spacetime.",0
"Such repulsive gravity turned out to be an excellent candidate for explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe, without the need for dark energy.",0
"The recent results of the ALPHA-g experiment, which show gravitational attraction between antihydrogen atoms and the Earth, seem to undermine this success in the cosmological field.",0
"Analyzing the above theory, we find two solutions that can be consistent with the experimental results, while preserving the large-scale gravitational repulsion.",0
"The first highlights how repulsive gravity can be the result of the interaction with an inverted space-time, but occupied by matter and not antimatter, and therefore the antimatter present in our space-time has no reason to exhibit gravitational repulsion.",0
"Finally, it is shown that, in a Newtonian approximation of the geodesic equation, time reversal is not a necessary operation for repulsive gravity, therefore opening the possibility of an expanding cosmos with a single time direction.",0
"Keywords Universe evolution Gravitational repulsion and antiparticles Baryon symmetry of the Universe Introduction In , astronomers discovered the acceleration of the Universe expansion (e.g. [ ,]).",0
"Since then, one of the most debated problems in physics and cosmology has been the existence and nature of the so-called dark energy, which should explain that unexpected finding.",0
"In fact, a repulsive force that acts in the Universe space-time challenges any previous physical knowledge, since the only known interaction among matter on these large scales is the universal gravitational attraction.",0
"The cosmic expansion acceleration, i.e. the presence of dark energy, has been formally attributed to an additional term that introduces negative pressure into the equations governing cosmic expansion.",0
"In its simplest form, this term corresponds to a cosmological constant, which can be associated with the energy of the quantum vacuum.",0
"These alternatives involve resort to scalar fields or the application of modifications to general relativity, including extensions to extra dimensions or higher-order curvature terms (e.g. [, , , , ]).",0
Both the classical (Newtonian) and relativistic (Einsteinian) gravitation theories seem to exclude that gravity could be in any way repulsive.,0
"However, it has been shown that general relativity can be consistently extended to the presence of antimatter (which was unknown at the time of the formulation of the two theories), based on its CPT properties, which imply that matter and antimatter are both gravitationally self-attractive, but mutually repulsive [ ].",0
"[physics.gen-ph] Mar Antimatter Gravity and the Results of the ALPHA-g Experiment be explained easily and naturally (together with the well-known expansion itself), with no need for unknown ingredients such as dark energy, or changes to current consolidated theories [].",0
A particular case where general relativity can further support repulsive gravity between matter and antimatter is the Kerr space-time.,0
"In fact, in [ ], it was shown that the CPT transformation requested in R4to get matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion is equivalent to the presence of the negativerregion in the R2 S2topology of Kerr(-Newman) space-time, which can be interpreted as the habitat of antimatter.",0
Cosmological models built on this theory of repulsive gravity between matter and CPT-transformed matter (in short CPT gravity) have shown many advantages with respect to current dark-energy models.,0
"This quantity is roughly equivalent to the mass of a typical supercluster, thereby restoring a balance between matter and antimatter within the Universe.",0
"On a larger cosmological scale, the gravitational repulsion originating from the presence of antimatter concealed within cosmic voids can supply more than adequate potential energy to propel both the ongoing Universe expansion and its acceleration.",0
"Importantly, this negates the necessity for an initial explosion or the introduction of dark energy as an explanatory factor.",0
"Additionally, the discrete distribution of these dark repulsors, in contrast to the uniformly pervasive dark energy, serves as a plausible explanation for dark flows and the observations of excessive inhomogeneities and anisotropies in the structure of the Universe.",0
"Other researchers have worked on cosmological models based on matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion (e.g. [,,,,]), which was obtained by assuming that the gravitational mass of antimatter is (at least partially) negative, and not, as in CPT gravity, with masses that are always strictly positive.",0
"The Hubble expansion law is obtained, together with the acceleration of the Universe expansion, with no need for a dark-energy component.",0
"However, all this success of the CPT-gravity theory (and similar matter-antimatter repulsive-gravity theories) is seriously undermined by the recent results of the ALPHA-g experiment, which show gravitational attraction of antihydrogen atoms in the Earth s gravity field [ ].",0
"What we want to investigate here is what is wrong with CPT gravity (where the mass is always strictly positive), and find a solution that brings theory into agreement with experiments.",0
"The CPT transformation is a fundamental concept in theoretical physics, particularly in the field of quantum field theory and particle physics.",0
It refers to a combination of three discrete operations: Charge conjugation (C): This operation involves changing all particles into their corresponding antiparticles while keeping their positions and momenta in space and time unchanged.,0
"In other words, it transforms particles with a certain electric charge into their antiparticles with opposite electric charge.",0
"The parity transformation flips the spatial coordinates, effectively changing left-handed particles into right-handed particles (or vice versa) without altering other properties.",0
"Time reversal (T): This operation involves reversing the direction of time, essentially changing the direction of particle trajectories from past to future or vice versa.",0
"According to the CPT theorem [ ], the combination of charge conjugation, parity transformation, and time reversal leaves the fundamental laws of physics invariant for all known particles and their interactions.",0
"This implies that if you observe a physical process and then apply the CPT transformation to it, you should see the same process occur in reverse, with all particles transformed into their corresponding antiparticles, positions and momenta inverted in space, and time running backward.",0
"So far, experimental observations have shown a high degree of agreement with the CPT symmetry, reinforcing its significance in particle physics.",0
"The PT part of transformation , i.e. dx dx , changes the sign of each component of any four-vector and odd-rank tensor, while it will be ineffective on even-rank tensors, being applied an even number of times.",0
"When the whole CPT transformation is applied, tensors containing the electric charge will suffer an additional sign change, so that even-rank (odd-rank) tensors, which are PT-even (PT-odd), become CPT-odd (CPT-even) in this case.",0
"The gravitational equation of motion of general relativity, i.e. the geodesic equation, is d2x d 2= dx d dx d , where the affine connection represents the gravitational field and the other three elements refer to the test particle.",0
"If we CPT-transform all the four elements, we obtain an identical equation describing the motion of an antimatter test particle in an antimatter-generated gravitational field, since all the four changes of sign cancel one another.",0
"However, if we transform only one of the two components, either the field or the particle (represented by the remaining three elements), we get a change of sign that converts the original gravitational attraction into repulsion, so that matter and antimatter repel each other.",0
"Here too all the elements are CPT-odd, since the first two elements of the Lorentz-force law contain an electric charge, and therefore this force reverses when one of the two components (particle or field) is CPT-transformed, as is commonly expected from the C transformation alone.",0
"By comparing the gravitational part with the electrodynamic one, it can be seen how the electric charge qof the latter corresponds to a gravitational charge m(g)dx /d , i.e. the energy-momentum four-vector p , which is CPT-odd.",0
"This highlights how the common simplistic opinion that the gravitational charge is the mass (which is always positive and therefore gravity would always be attractive) is incorrect, while p changes sign in an inverted space-time, thus giving repulsive gravity.",0
"Possible solutions to the conflict with ALPHA-g results We note that in Equations and repulsive gravity is obtained by the PT transformation of one of the two components (particle or field), while C is ineffective.",0
This solution without antimatter would save the cosmological scenario where alternate islands of opposite space-times cause the needed gravitational repulsion to account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe.,0
"On the other hand, the Lorentz-force law in Equation is sensitive only to C (changing the sign of qand/or F ), while PT is ineffective, since the two possible changes of sign of the four-acceleration and four-velocity would cancel each other out.",0
Antimatter Gravity and the Results of the ALPHA-g Experiment Figure : Schematization of the two solutions to the conflict between CPT gravity and ALPHA-g results.,0
"It preserves the gravitational repulsion between opposite space-times needed for accelerated cosmic expansion, but without requiring matter-antimatter repulsive gravity.",0
"If the answer is yes, then the antimatter we know, which travels forward in time and does not exhibit gravitational repulsion, is not like the CPT-transformed one which occupies islands of space alternating with those of matter and causes accelerated expansion, as shown in [ ].",0
"And gravitational repulsion would be just the mechanism necessary to ensure that islands and anti-islands never meet, and that the coexistence of two opposite space-times does not cause a cosmic annihilation.",0
"Antimatter Gravity and the Results of the ALPHA-g Experiment Discussion and conclusions Unfortunately, astronomical observations cannot distinguish between the two solutions, since in both cases the radiation emitted from an inverted space-time would be received by us as advanced radiation, for which we do not (yet) have adequate detectors.",0
"The fact is that the equivalence principle, in its various forms, is implicitly considered valid when the masses and fields involved belong to the same space-time.",0
"Repulsive gravity arises from general relativity when masses and fields belong to two opposite space-times, and therefore it too is a consequence of the equivalence principle.",0
"Even the representation of space as a sheet deformed by the presence of masses, which therefore deviates the test particle from its rectilinear trajectory, is easy to understand for repulsive gravity.",0
"The test particle in an opposite space-time is below the sheet, and perceives the deformations produced by the masses as repulsive hills.",0
"In summary, there are two solutions, consisting of amendments to the original CPT-gravity theory, which allow to conserve the large-scale repulsive gravity needed for the accelerated expansion of the Universe and at the same time to get along with the results of the ALPHA-g experiment.",0
"If we then add the further assumption that the field is weak, we can easily find the vectorial form of the Newton law d2x/dt2= , which is completely insensitive to T, while the P-oddness of the field is in the gradient, and the P-oddness of the particle is in the acceleration.",0
"So we can conclude that, at least in the Newtonian approximation, the equation of motion retains the same attractive/repulsive properties as the original geodesic equation, but now repulsive gravity could act between two opposite spaces, without time reversal.",0

We use a cavity central photon energy of c= eV because total dissociation occurs at maximum efficiency at this energy (as will be discussed later).,0
"Applying the Lindblad master equation, one can describe the temporal evolution of the nuclear wave packet dynamics for the fixed-in-space model.",0
"As the wave packet oscillates on the |B, state, it reaches a region where the two diabatic states |B, and|X, are closest (see Fig.",0
"In contrast, the dissociation probability continues to rise slightly, reaching a maximum at around t= fs, after which it becomes essentially saturated.",0
"The non-Hermitian TDSE allows for the inclusion of a greater number of nuclear DOFs (rotational and vibrational) in the quantum-dynamical description, owing to its lower computational cost compared to the Lindblad master equation.",0
The results obtained from the non-Hermitian TDSE are in perfect agreement with those derived from the Lindblad equation (see Fig. ).,0
"This extended model enables the inclusion of light-induced conical intersections (LICIs), thereby providing a more accurate treatment of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics.",0
"In the lossy cavity scenario, the photon energy undergoes broadening around the cavity central frequency, resulting in the appearance of an infinite number of photon energies at both lower and higher frequencies relative to the central frequency.",0
",95At any given time, the nuclear dynamics are driven by this infinite set of light-induced conical intersections, formed by couplings at the corresponding photon energies.",0
where the lower and upper polariton surfaces are shown for selected cavity frequencies in the range of c= eV eV. Let us now explore and discuss the fixed-in-space and 2D nuclear dynamics in the nonHermitian lossy TDSE framework.,0
/ E [eV] = eV Figure : Two-dimensional polaritonic potential energy surfaces along the vibrational and rotational coordinates of the H 2molecule.,0
Figures are shown for c= eV (cavity central photon energy) as well as for eight other energy values among the infinitely many that arise within the range of energy broadening.,0
"The c= eV value is the resonance energy as well, because the two potential energy curves are the closest to each other here.",0
"Moreover, when the wave packet reaches the positions of the LICIs, nonadiabatic population transfer can take place between the upper and lower polaritonic states, allowing part of the population to transfer back from the |X, state to the |B, state.",0
"Additionally, due to the lossy nature of the cavity, photon energy broadening results in the coupling of the|X, and|B, surfaces at a range of frequencies, not just the central frequency, further perturbing the dynamics.",0
"To proceed, we set several values for the central photon energy ranging from c= eV to c= eV and calculate the dissociation probabilities.",0
", the results from the Lindblad and the non-Hermitian lossy Schr odinger equations with fixed-in-space molecules are nearly identical across all frequencies considered.",0
"This perfect agreement allows us to conclude that, for a given range of frequencies and parameters, the non-Hermitian Schr odinger equation provides an accurate description of the nonadiabatic dissociation dynamics.",0
"Using the non-Hermitian Schr odinger equation, we then compared the dissociation probabilities obtained from the fixed-in-space and 2D models.",0
Dissociation probabilities ( PD) as a function of cavity central photon energy at tf= fs obtained by the Lindblad and the non-Hermitian lossy Schr odinger schemes with fixed-in-space molecules.,0
Dissociation probabilities ( PD) as a function of cavity central photon energy at tf= fs obtained by the non-Hermitian lossy Schr odinger equation for the case of fixedin-space and rotating molecules.,0
"It is evident that both the fixed-in-space and 2D models predict the highest dissociation probability at central photon energy c= eV. Interestingly, the two descriptions yield different results for energies below c= eV, but they are quite similar for frequencies above.",0
"This disparity arises because, for central energies lower than c= eV, the photon energy broadening results in fewer coupling frequencies, which cannot fully compensate for the combined effects of molecular rotation and light-induced conical intersections (LICIs) compared to the fixed-in-space description.",0
Dissociation probabilities ( PD) as a function of cavity central photon energy at tf= fs obtained by the Lindblad master equation.,0
"As the cavity decay rate decreases, the dissociation probability curve becomes narrower, although its maximum value increases slightly.",0
"The dissociation probability is at its narrowest when = , at which situation the dissociation probability reaches its maximum value.",0
"This is because, with a finite cavity lifetime which is inversely proportional to the decay rate, the photon energy broadens, causing photons with higher energies than the central frequency to appear.",0
"As a result, for a given central coupling frequency, dissociation can also occur at energies below = eV. The higher the cavity decay rate, the shorter the lifetime, and thus the broader the photon energy distribution.",0
"Due to the infinite cavity lifetime, the energy broadening vanishes entirely, and the resonance condition is perfectly satisfied, leading to the highest dissociation rate from the|X, state.",0
"In these cases, the|X, and|B, states always intersect, and the dynamics are determined by the coupling frequencies of the photon energy broadening in the lossy cavity.",0
"This observation is consistent with the fact that the long-wavelength Floquet picture and the cavity description in the first excited state manifold are identical when the central frequency is the resonance frequency (i.e., when the two states are closest to each other).",0
", Conclusions We have explored the combined effects of molecular rotations and light-induced conical intersections (LICIs) on nonadiabatic quantum dynamics within a lossy cavity.",0
"When the cavity central frequency is below c= eV, the dissociation probability is reduced, while for frequencies above resonance, both the fixed-in-space and two-dimensional descriptions yield nearly identical results.",0
"Notably, due to energy broadening induced by cavity losses, dissociation also occurs at central frequencies well below the cavity resonance frequency.",0
"In this limit, with finite photon energy and within the framework of the first excited-state manifold, the behavior of the system is equivalent to the well-known Floquet description used in laser physics, which applies to continuous wave limits.",0

I. I NTRODUCTION Efficient and exact handling of endpoint constraints is a critical component for the parallelization of algorithms in optimal control (OC).,0
"In many real-time robotics applications, strict terminal constraints must be met within tight computational time limits.",0
"In this context, differential dynamic programming (DDP) has become the preferred approach, as it leverages the Markovian structure of the problem through Riccati recursions.",0

"Therefore, the speed of the center of mass immediately after contact is Ucm=D(U0sin 0 D 0/) DJ+D.

"Since the energy is mostly from deformation in the horizontal direction, the ball will regain kinetic energy in this direction.",0
"Due to the contact at point B, the ball will roll as the elastic energy is restored into kinetic energy in the horizontal direction.",0
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTS Experiments when the nick shot is not observed In this section we provide a detailed description of two experiments shown in Fig.,0
"Therefore, the motion of the center of mass of the ball has a negative velocity even for times longer that t2 even as the ball is already moving away from the wall in the horizontal direction, as seen on Fig.",0
"Testing several collision conditions A vast experimental campaign was conducted, including three balls, two temperatures, two incident angles, for a range of impact speeds and initial contact locations.",0

The residual term is a random parameter from a common prior F0that is unknown to the planner and normalized to have mean zero and unit variance of each component.,0
"By conditioning on the covariance matrices j, I take jto be known and equal to the consistent covariance matrix estimates from the empirical studies.",0

"Abstract Hydrogen ions , or protons , provide the medium by which energy is stored and converted in biological systems .",0
The present work provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of biological energy management by focusing on the relationship between vectorial proton flows and the geometry of energy producing organelles in eukaryotes.,0
"The leading models of proton mediated energy conversion, the de localised proton (or chemiosmotic) model and the localised proton model , are presented in a complementary perspective .",0
"While the de localised model provides a description that relies on equilibrium thermodynamic s, the localised model addresses dynamic processes that are better described using out -of-equilibrium thermodynamics.",0
Energy is absorbed to drive molecules and charges against their concentration gradient and energy is released when they move back along the concentration gradient.,0
"Because of the non -uniform distribution of electrochemical potentials, v ectorial transformations provide a connection between chemical composition, energy and space, and are at the core of biological energy management.",0
"Gradients in electrochemical potential can drive diffusion processes, if the separator is permeable , or ca n store energy as a potential difference, if it is not permeable .",0
"Vectorial p rocesses that generate charge separation are particularly relevant, because the contribution from electrostatic energy is markedly sensitive to small changes in spatial distribution.",0
"However, the ones that dominate cellular energy interconversion are the two smallest ones, the electron and the hydrogen cation, H+, i.e. the proton.",0
"In photosynthetic phosphorylation , it is the energy from light absorption that triggers the chain of reactions leading to ATP synthesis.",0
"A widespread expectation at the time was that a short lived molecular species, a high energy intermediate , was created in the early stages of oxidative or photosynthetic phosphorylation , and would then undergo rapid conversion to the ATP molecule , which acts as a more stable energy reservoir for cellular metabolism.",0
"Two proposals , by P. Mitchell and R.J.P. Williams, emerged simultaneously in the early s suggesting that the energy obtained by oxygen reduction could be transmitted by coupl ing vectorial electron and proton transfer at a membrane or at an interface (Williams initially used the word displaced , instead of vectorial ).",0
"(Mitchell, ) (Williams , ) Both of them bypass ed the formation of a high -energy molecular intermediate by attributing its role to local differences in proton concentration .",0
"Acceptance grew only gradually , over the years, wit h the publication of corroborative experiments , and with the general progress in the understanding of membrane physiology.",0
"(Mitchell, ) Equation shows one of the possible stoichiometries of the reaction, where P i represents the phosphate anion in accessible ionization states.",0
"The direct consequence of this topology is that differences in acidity between the two phases can control the thermodynamics of the reaction, and drive it towards ATP synthesis or ATP hydrolysis .",0
The observation that the relationship between proton consumption and ATP synthesis is uncoupled from the stoichiometry of Equation indicated that the role of the proton is not simply that of a stoichiometric reactant.,0
"In its mature formulation, the mode l became a general paradigm for cellular energy management that extends beyond oxidative phosphorylation .",0
"Its fundamental tenet is that the difference in proton concentration between the two aqueous phases adjoining a membrane , i.e. a proton gradient, is a medium for the storage of energy, which can be later used to drive cellular biochemistry .",0
"The energy accumulated by the formation of proton gradients and associated ionic gradients is expressed by the electrochemical potential of the proton , +, and by the electrostatic transmembrane potential , .",0
"Differences in proton concentration between the two sides of the membrane result in a protonmotive force, pmf, in units of Volts, with an associated difference in electrochemical potential, + (Equation ).",0
"(Mitchell, ) Equation is based on the assumption of a Donnan equilibrium for protons , whereas the distribution of other charged species contributes to the membrane potential .",0
"log(a H+p/aH+n) (Equation ) R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; F is Faraday s constant; aH+p/aH+n is the ratio of the activity of the proton between the two sides of the membrane, with log(a H+p/aH+n) = pH, the difference in pH between the two phases.",0
Expected values of pmf during metabolic turnover are typically between mV and mV. Equation is also applicable to dynamic process es (e.g. during proton consumption by ATP-synthase) provided that changes are slow enough to allow for the rapid re -establishment of equilibrium.,0
"The energy for creating the gradient can originate from exergonic chemical transformations, such as oxygen reduction in mitochondrial terminal oxidation, or from photon absorption, such as in the photosynthetic apparatus of the chloroplast or in the purple membrane of H. salinarum .",0
"The stored energy can later be used to drive a range of endergonic cellular processes, in addition to ATP synthesis, such as the vectorial translocation of other ions and molecules across membranes against their concentration gradient.",0
"Energy can also be consumed unproductively, by uncoupling proton source and sink while allowing the proton gradient to dissipate, a process contribut ing to thermogenesis.",0
"In recognition of their role in energy storage , protons accumulated on the p -side are sometimes called energized protons, while the membranes that support proton gradients are variously termed energized membranes, energy -transducing membranes, or energy -conserving membranes.",0
"A proton gradient between the two opposite aqueous phases is used to store energy, which is extracted by returning protons from the p -side back to the n -side, thus driving ATP synthesis by ATP -synthase (pr oton consumer B) or the translocation of another cation by an antiport (proton consumer C).",0
"Because of the quantitative relationship provided by Equation , the chemiosmotic model was amenable to direct validation from its inception.",0
"Early experiments supported its validity by showing that the pmf at the mitochondrial inner membrane is correlated to metabolic activity, such as oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis .",0
"(e.g. Reid, ) Considerable momentum was provided by the independent acid bath experiments performed by Jagendorf on chloroplasts (Jagendorf , ) , showing that a rapid increase of the external pH of thylakoids triggered the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate.",0
Analogous supporting experiments were later reported by multiple groups that achieved ATP synthesis or hydrolysis by controlling the pH gradient across ATP -synthases reconstituted in vesicles and planar bilayers.,0
"As an increasing number of experimental results became available, the following decade saw progressive acceptance of the model.",0
"In a separate proposal, Williams provided a model suggesting that the core of cellular energy management is the direct movement of protons from a proton source, typically a protein, to another protein that acts as the proton sink along a membrane.",0
"In agreement with the chemiosmotic model, it recognizes the role of vectorial processes, including proton transfer, in cellular energy management .",0
"While the localised model bypasse s the requirement for a high energy molecular intermediate, it also refrain s from involving the electrochemical potential of the proton as a physical counterpart to it.",0
The localised proton model has been presented as a more comprehensive description of the proton circuits that mediate cellular energy interconversion.,0
It is the direct transfer of protons between source and sink that is both necessary and sufficient for the purpose of energy transmission.,0
"Nonetheless, the model is consistent with experimental observations that are discordant with the chemiosmotic model and cannot be accounted for by Equation .",0
"Irreversible Thermodynamics of De localised and Localised Proton Transfer Quantitative analysis of localised proton transfer has been allowed by the application of out of-equilibrium thermodynamics , bypassing the equilibrium description provided by Equation .",0
"In this respect, they provide a tool that is better suited than equilibrium thermodynamics to the study of living systems, which are inherently out -ofequilibrium.",0
"The formalism is particularly amenable to describe vectorial processes, providing quantitative relationship s between the force that drives a transformation and the magnitude of the resulting changes (flow -force relationships) .",0
"The simple one dimensional case of flow -force relationship is shown in Equation , where J represents a flux (e.g. particles per unit area per unit time) , q is a gradient that acts as a driving force, and L is a phenomenological kinetic coefficient .",0
"J = L q Equation When applied to cellular energy conversion, q can correspond to , pH or + and the flux represents metabolic turnover, such as consumption of oxygen , or production of ATP, or other metabolites, in the case of mitochondrial preparations.",0
"Proton Mobility at the Membrane Surface The localised model is supported by several experiments that target the mobility of protons at the membrane -water interface of model systems, providing measures of interfacial proton conductivity and diffusion coefficients.",0
Theoretical investigations on the organization of membrane surfaces converge with experimental ones in identifying a preferential region for localised proton flow in the proximity of phospholipid headgroups.,0
"The region corresponds to a layer less than one nanometre in thickness, where protons are retained by an energy barrier attributed to the organization of interfacial water induced by membrane surface charges.",0
Overall experimental and theoretical reports over the past forty years have validate d the basic assumptions of the localised proton model and have created conditions for its general acceptance.,0
Sodium ions as mediators of energy transfer A milestone in cellular physiology has been the recognition that the Na+ ion can also act as a mediator of cellular energy transfer .,0
"The action of antiporters can interconvert H+ and Na+ gradients, allowing some organisms to use either ion as an energy mediator (Figures and ) .",0
"(Nirody , ) More commonly, Na+ is used alongside H+ as a mediator of energy transfer, leading to a generalized model that describes H+, Na+ and ATP as interconvertible energy currency units of cellular metabolism .",0
"Alternative and Complementary Models While localised and de localised proton conduction models have provided the currently accepted canon, alternative or complementary models of cellular energy management have been proposed by several investigators .",0
"Other proposals fully bypassed the requirement for proton flows , suggesting that transfer of energy takes place via direct interaction between membrane proteins .",0
"Proton flows and proton circuits Solutions of electrolytes are conductors, whereby ions, including protons, act as charge carriers and allow the passage of current.",0
"The hydrophobic core of the membrane acts as the dielectric of a capacitor, capable of storing energy in the form of charges on its opposite surfaces.",0
"Proton pumps are equivalent to batter ies, generating a voltage from chemical processes, or photodiodes, generating a voltage from the energy of absorbed photons.",0
"Because the quantities that characterize the electronic components , such as capacitance and resistance, are determined by the geometr y of the system , schemes such as the one in Figure exemplify the close connection between the overall architecture of the membrane assembly and its performance in energy interconversion and storage.",0
"Subcellular Architecture and Biological Energy Conversion Our current understanding of proton transfer at energized membranes has been greatly informed by the architecture of F 1F0 ATP-synthase sites, where F represents the globular subunit in the aqueous phase of the n -side, where ATP synthesis or hydrolysis occurs, and F represents the transmembrane subunit, across which the proton current flows.",0
"The most detailed structural and functional information available in this respect comes from the eukaryotic enzymes located in mitochondria and chloroplasts , the organelles dedicate d to energy production .",0
"The protein is comprised of a globular domain exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, the F domain, and by a cylindrical hydrophobic domain that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane, the F domain.",0
"(Walker , ) Proton flow across the membrane causes the rotation of the F domain and the shaft relative to the F domain , providing the energy for the conformational changes in F that lead to ATP synthesis.",0
"The transfer of protons across the membrane and along their concentration gradient releases the energy stored in the electrochemical potential difference, but does not directly supply protons for the condensation reaction in Equation , which are derived from the adjoining bulk phase.",0
"The number of protons transferred per ATP molecule synthesised is determined by the structure of the F domain, instead of Equation , and is species dependent.",0
Transfer of protons from the mitochondrial intramembrane space (p-side) to the matrix (n-side) across the F domain rotates the axis of the protein and provides the energy for the conformational changes in F that drive the synthesis of ATP .,0
"The inner mitochondrial membrane is characterized by folded protrusions that extend into the matrix, the cristae, with t he morphology of flattened sacks or tubes .",0
"It is proposed that the curvature of the membrane at the rim is impo sed by the dimers themselves (Paumard, ) (Strauss, ) , which actively shape the geometry of the p -side.",0
"Regions of high membrane curvature, such as rims and apexes, favour the local accumulation of charges and it has been suggested that the geometry of the latter is tailored to channel proton transfer in the direction of the ATP -synthase .",0
"In contrast to the p -side, the n -side displays a more open environment, being turned towards the matrix side of the mitochondrion, with characteristic distances of nm or greater.",0
Measurements of anomalous diffusion of macromolecules show that cytoplasmic crowding limits the Brownian diffusion of particles larger than ~ nm (Figure ).,0
"Their location also exposes them to the flow of protons and metabolites from a multitude of cytoplasmic processes and from the extracellular environment, complicating the assessment of the interplay of geometry and proton flows.",0
The complexes of the oxygen reduction chain are distributed in the flatter regions of the crista and pump to the intracristae space (p -side) protons from the mitochondrial matrix ( n-side) where ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place.,0
"The energy transducing membranes from these single cell organisms are not localised to organelles dedicated to energy production, but are constituents of the cellular envelope and support a wide range of processes, from signalling to metabolic turnover , that can affect proton concentrations in vivo and increase the complexity of the analysis .",0
"The Volume of the p -side as a Determinant of Energization A common feature of F 1F0ATP-synthase systems from energy producing organelles is the operation in environments that are geometrically well defined and locally constrained, particularly in the direction normal to the membrane on the p -side.",0
"The limitations of macroscopic theoretical treatments in accounting for the small dimensionality of these structures could be responsible for some of the inconsistencies reported for the chemiosmotic theory , which relies on bulk quantities to define Equation .",0
"One notable consequence of this compartmentalized geometry is that the criticism originally raised towards the chemiosmotic model, about the time needed for a proton to diffuse from membrane to bulk and the resulting negligible change on + (the Pacific Ocean analogy ) is not applicable to the mitochondrial and thylakoid systems.",0
A consequence of t he small dimensions and geometry of the p -side compartments associated to eukaryotic ATP -synthase s is that their properties are consistent with aspects of both the localised and de localised proton models.,0
"Protons can rapidly diffuse through and equilibrate in the aqueous phase of such compartments, and store energy via changes in electrochemical potential, in agreement with the description of the delocalised proton model.",0
"At the same time, the highly organized molecular scale environment allows for direct proton transfer between the two environments, modulating the energy transfer process , in agreement with the localised model description .",0
"Using the language of protic circuit representation s, the delocalised proton model describes energy storage by the battery component of the circuit, while the localised model describes the wiring of the motor component.",0
"Conclusions and Future Perspectives Current structural information on the environment of ATP -synthases in vivo supports specific aspects of both dominant models of cellular energy management, based on localised and delocalised protons.",0
"In contrast to the early competitive relationship , the models increasingly appear to be complementary descriptions of separate facets of cellular energy management.",0
"While the de localised model focuses on energy balance at thermodynamic equilibrium, the localised model and its derivatives address the mechanistic aspects of energy conversion outof-equilibrium.",0
"Other models of the mechanism of energy transduction have also been proposed over the years, then abandoned in favour of the latter two.",0
"In light of the large amount of structural information now avai lable on the compartments that regulate ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, it is now worth reconsidering if any aspects of such alternative models can be recovered and incorporated in a more exhaustive description of energy transduction.",0

Such a change could manifest in clues about how to extend current theories of funda mental physics and combine the two pillars of quantum mechanics and general relativity.,0
"In the recent past, observa tions using the cosmic microwave back ground (CMB) achieved unprecedented sub-percent errors on the parameters of this model (Planck Collaboration, ).",0

"Moreover, there is no theoretical reason to stick to the minimal CDM model, and several extensions have been considered: a universe with non-zero curvature; dynam ical dark energy models to account for the current accelerated expansion; inter acting dark matter, including different scenarios for the neutrino species; modi fications to general relativity; or changes in the nature of primordial fluctuations.",0
"At the same time, the CMB is expected to continue to bring improvements and eventually detect primordial gravitational waves, providing insights into the physics of the early Universe.",0
"As we enter the regime of high-precision cosmology, systematic errors are becom ing the limiting factor in constraining cos mological parameters.",0
Combining different experiments will help reduce such sys tematics and bring more confidence to any discovery while also lifting parameter degeneracies.,0
Here we explore the syn ergy gains in combining data from the wide-area cosmology surveys planned with the SKAO and ESO facilities.,0

Early experiments with photomultiplier tubes by Walraven resulted in the Walraven five channel spectrophotometer1and along with other instruments such as the Danish uvby five channel spectrophotometer2demonstrated that simultaneous measurement of multiple bands is superior to sequential observations of multiple bands when measuring relative colors of astronomical objects.,0
"Examples of simultaneous multi-band photometry observations include stellar pulsations of subluminous B (sdB) stars,3constraining physical properties of transiting exoplanets,4changes in the spectral energy distribution of supernovae5and characterization of spots on M-dwarf stars.",0
"Changes in seeing and transparency can still affect the recorded brightness of an object, but any variable absorption (e.g. clouds), which is colorless, has the same effect on all wavelengths,, leaving relative color measurements unaffected if the measurements are made simultaneously.",0
"The complexities of these pipelines, which can include binning higher resolution spectra, wavelength calibration, and spectral fitting techniques, may introduce biases to the retrieved information.24The common optical path and simultaneous nature of ETSI observations mean that any instrumental or environmental common path errors, including atmospheric scintillation, are greatly reduced.",0
The ETSI optical design was optimized to ensure the point source % encircled energy at all wavelengths is well below typical seeing (arcseconds) and that the PSF s would not appreciably change shape for small changes in focus (see Fig.,0
"Requirement was on-axis % encircled energy within a25.4 mspot size for the collimator and on-axis % encircled energy within a .7 mspot size for the cameras, tested at three wavelengths.",0
"To do this we ratio each spectral band of the science star to another spectral band of the same science star (see Equation below), which differs from traditional photometric measurements made by ratioing the flux of the science target to one or more reference stars (see Equation below).",0
Optimization wavelengths nm: Wavelength coverage was driven by coverage of modeled exoplanet atmospheric features and constrained by the sensitivity of the ETSI detectors. .,0
"The camera optimization was constrained by the requirements listed above, as well as the required mechanical spacing between the pupil and front lens to accommodate the prisms and clean-up filters.",0
"The camera and collimator were first developed separately, then the majority of the optimization was as a complete system in order to set the collimator-prism-camera angles as well as tune the prisms to achieve the desired spacing between filter bands (the simulated spacing between bands ranges between mand mor pixels for mpixels).",0
Final optimization of the optical design involved extensive discussion with the optical manufacturer (JML Optical) about glass blank availability and constraints on lens sizes as well as optimization of glass choices for a minimum of axial color.,0
"The field positions with missing spots are at the edge of the field and those wavelengths fall off the edge of the detector ( x , mpixels).",0
"Constraints remained on the focal length and axial color, and final optimization minimized the root mean square change in focal length at each of the ETSI filter bands.",0
"Fig The efficiency of both channels including collimator, multi-chroic, prisms, clean up filters, camera optics, and detector quantum efficiency from vendor measurements.",0
We modeled dozens of exoplanet atmospheres using Exo-Transmit28and aligned the spectral bands with detectable molecular and atomic absorption features.27Two small portions of the spectrum (nm and nm) are blocked completely in order to maintain adequate spacing between spectral bands of interest on the detectors.,0
Larger numbers of bands require the bands to be spaced equally in wave number to maximize the filter efficiency and achieve the required cut-on/off transmission slope.,0

The final prism angle and position relative to the collimator and cameras was included in the overall optical design optimization.,0
"OPTOMECHANICAL DESIGN The optomechanical concept mimics a typical experimental setup in a laboratory, with an optical bench that all optics are mounted to with the optical axis parallel to the bench surface.",0
A coordinate measuring arm (FARO Quantum) was used to measure the perpendicularity and the cylinder was shimmed with plastic shim stock to within arcmin of perpendicular to the telescope interface ring.,0
"The finished structure is very light weight, the complete instrument when mounted to the telescope is 70kg and when separated, the aluminum plate and telescope interface and carbon fiber structure (without optics, cameras, etc.) are both easily carried by a single person.",0
"ETSI has been assembled/disassembled at McDonald Observatory several times during commissioning and science observations, each time the optics and cameras have been mounted to the breadboard with no additional alignment in only a few minutes.",0
The large pixel size and high quantum efficiency (peak QE of %) make for efficient collection of photons and the readout time of 20msenables a minimum of observation time lost to readout.,0
"However, the usable field of view will be less as the original optimization was for a smaller field of view so a combination of image quality reduction and vignetting will limit the field to approximately arcminutes on the McDonald m telescope.",0
The ETSI pipeline then automatically identifies the position of each PSF using the known dispersion of the instrument and centroids these positions to find the center of mass of each PSF within a box of half the size of the elliptical apertures.,0
"The light curves were then converted to an instrumental magnitude with the standard formula mi= log10(fi) Common-path systematics (such as those from airmass, cloud cover, and atmospheric colorterms) were removed from each light curve using a time-averaged trend light curve unique to each bandpass.",0
"However, because the light from the two stars did not travel through exactly the same path prior to landing on the detector, and because not every star in the sky has a nearby, similar magnitude companion, the comparison star method is not a fool-proof method to remove systematics.",0
"Therefore, a model of the white-light transit signal was injected into each bandpass s de-trended light curve prior to measuring the transit depth at each wavelength.",0
"Observational Bias detrending: Ground-based observations will suffer from changes due to airmass, extinction from clouds, changes in the temperature of the detector, and the slight changes of the position of the star on the detector.",0
"Specifically, ETSI transmission spectra measurements are sensitive to the presence of atoms (potassium and sodium), molecules (methane, water, and TiO), and clouds and aerosols in the exoplanet s atmosphere (Rayleigh scattering).",0
These self-referenced differential measurements serve as a proxy for the measured atomic and molecular features in the exoplanet s atmosphere.,0
The uncertainties in the bins represent the scatter in the original data s spectrum at the given instrument wavelengths.,0

Abstract Measurements of the luminosity delivered to the CMS experiment during the leadlead data-taking periods in and are presented for the first time.,0
The collisions were recorded at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of TeV; the data sample is three times larger than the data sample.,0
[hep-ex] Mar Introduction The measurement of the luminosity for lead-lead (PbPb) collision data at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy sNN= TeV recorded at the CERN LHC interaction point (IP) with the CMS detector in and is reported for the first time.,0
Brief descriptions of the three luminometers and the respective algorithms used to estimate the instantaneous luminosity are discussed in the following.,0
"The PLT measures the rate of triple coincidences, where a hit is observed in all three planes, typically corresponding to a track from a particle originating at the IP .",0
"Specifically, we calculate the fraction pof bunch crossings with no detected interaction, i.e., no particle traversing through the luminometer.",0
"This method remains reliable in low detector occupancy conditions, where the probability of observing zero interactions is high.",0
"Experimental setup The parameters xand yrepresent physical dimensions of the colliding bunches, and measurements with different luminometers are thus expected to yield the same result.",0
"Experimental setup The PbPb luminosity scan program was performed in the LHC fill in December , and the program in fills , , and in November .",0
"Beam-beam effects In nucleus-nucleus collisions, the number of produced particles depends strongly on the geometrical overlap of the ions at the time of the collision, called centrality [], which is zero in head-on collisions, whereas higher values are obtained in the case of peripheral collisions.",0
The number of charged particles produced per unit of varies from event to event (from few hundred for peripheral collisions to few thousand for the most central collisions) and the large particle multiplicity of head-on collisions leads to high tracker occupancy.,0
"Beam-beam effects The strength of the mutual electromagnetic forces of the two colliding positively charged bunches changes as a function of beam separation and, if uncorrected, can bias the results obtained from the vdM scans.",0
"In addition to the beam-beam deflection, the electromagnetic forces distort the bunch particle density distributions (often called optical or dynamiceffect), depending on the beam separation.",0
The residual misalignment is inTransverse factorizability of the bunch particle density cluded by shifting the offset scans either orthogonal or along the scan direction by 2 m. Repeating the fit and the pseudo-experiments yields an effect of % in and up to % in .,0
The straight line fit takes into account the covariance of the scan combinations emerging due to shared constituent scans.,0
"A dedicated study to assess the scan-to-scan and bunch-to-bunch variations in shows that the maximal deviation from the average in both cases is covered by the relevant uncertainties (the vdM fit uncertainty for the bunch-to-bunch variation, and the standard deviation over the BCIDs for the scan-to-scan comparisons).",0
"From left to right the results are given for PLT, HFOC, and in also for BCM1F. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the measurements per BCID, accounting for statistical fluctuations.",0
"The standard deviation of the ratio over the full PbPb data taking, i.e., %, is considered as the systematic uncertainty accounting for the cross-detector stability.",0
"The systematic uncertainty related to cross-detector stability is estimated using the quadratic sum of these mean and standard deviation, resulting in a value of %, which corresponds to a range that encloses most of the various shortand long-term differences between the PLT and HFOC results.",0
"The dominant uncertainty due to transverse factorizability of the bunch particle densities is due to the nonclosure of the method driven by the large statistical uncertainty of the data, and is thus treated as uncorrelated between the years.",0
Yes Total normalization uncertainty Total integration uncertainty Total uncertainty Conclusions The measurement of the luminosity delivered to the CMS experiment during the lead-lead (PbPb) data-taking periods in and at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of TeV is presented for the first time.,0

"Recently, a handful of theories describing particular aspects of living systems have been proposed, like the free energy principle [, ], assembly theory [, ], constructor theory [, ], and others (e.g. [, ]), but these are less relevant to our purposes.",0
"In our view, the blind spot lies in the fact that some abstract theories are hard to map to concrete systems, while others take the opposite stance by describing life as the mere jigglings and wigglings of atoms .",0
"The resulting topology of states can form the basis of a process pathscape , describing the collection of behavioral paths that a system can explore from a given state, akin to a phase portrait in dynamical systems theory.",0
"Let us now introduce some useful notions from linear algebra, which will help us state some of our formal results more precisely and succinctly, though we will map our intuitions back to the system and process graphs we just described. .",0
"Moreover, the use of matrix notation simplifies the discussion of key concepts such as conserved quantities and cycles, which will be central to our formal definitions.",0
"Because Sis the matrix representation of a system, subsystems can be easily defined as matrices that are component-wise smaller than the system matrix.",0
One of the main advantages of using matrix and vector representations is the possibility of using matrix multiplication.,0
"Let us recall that for an arbitrary matrix Mof dimension m nand a column vector xof dimension n, the multiplication Mxresults in a vector of dimension m: (Mx)j=X iMijxi.",0
"Note that this is the same symbol as the matrix representation ( S0,S1), which is not the same as S1 S0, but the specific use should be clear within a context.",0
"This method resembles what is done in biochemistry, for instance, where the order of events and mass conservation in a pathway are elucidated by radioactive labeling of specific atoms in the participant molecules.",0
"Typically, when dealing with entities of non-negligible mass that adhere to mass conservation principles, the vector that represents the mass of each entity qualifies the system as strongly conservative.",0
"For reasons we explained before, we will be interested in scenarios where only a subsystem Asatisfies the cycle equation.",0
"The property implied by this theorem is referred to as semi-self-maintenance in [] and it is also part of the definition of an autocatalytic cycle in [], but we believe that in our approach these properties emerge from more fundamental processes, rather than being already part of a definition. .",0
"Notice that since the vector nis full, all internal entities will be part of some catalytic cycle in the process pimplied by the theorem, even if they do not appear as its inputs or outputs.",0
"Moreover, the breakdown of aged or dysfunctional entities becomes necessary to reuse basic building components and energy for other processes what is known as catabolism, for which anabolism serves a dual role. .",0
"We proceed as in the proof of Theorem , with the parallel composition of the transformations in u. We continue by matching inputs and outputs, ensuring that no directed cycles are formed.",0

Our experiments confirm that scaling depth as (log n)is necessary and sufficient for recognizing hard regular languages.,0
"A decoder-only (s, r, t)-universal transformer with hheads, dlayers, model dimension m(divisible byh), and feedforward width wis specified by: .An embedding projection matrix E: Qmand positional encoding function :N Qm, which we assume separates 1from other indices (Merrill & Sabharwal, ); .A list of s initial transformer layers (defined in Section ); .",0
"self-attention sublayer is parameterized by a mask m Qm, output projection matrix W:Qm Qm, and, for k h, query, key, and value matrices Qk,Kk,Vk, each of whichis a projection from QmtoQm/h.",0
The limit implements averaging-hard attention: all probability mass is concentrated on the indices jfor which the attention score is maximized.,0
"Suppose (i), (m), and (ai)(or (ai)) are present in the residual stream of a transformer at each token i. Then, there exists a -layer transformer with causally masked attention and masked prenorm that, on any input sequence, adds (bi)and (ci)to the residual stream at each token i. Proof.",0
"In Appendix C, we prove the following, which shows that the answer is yes: Theorem (Graph Connectivity) .There exists a (,,)-universal transformer Twith both causal and unmasked heads that, when unrolled log2n times, solves connectivity on (directed or undirected) graphs over nvertices: given the n nadjacency matrix of a graph G,n3 padding tokens, and s, t {, . . .",0
"Thus, while NC1circuits (which have log depth) cannot express graph connectivity unless NC1=NL, log-depth transformers can.",0
Theorem (Width Scaling) .LetTbe a fixed-depth transformer whose width (model dimension) grows as a polynomial in nand whose weights on input length n(to accommodate growing width) are computable in L. Then Tcan be simulated in L-uniform TC0.,0
"We report on an extensive set of experiments to address these questions, training models of different depths and widths on the A5state tracking task (Merrill et al., ), which is a canonical testbed for hard regular language recognition (Thm. ).",0
"Strong linear fits imply theory/experiment match for modeling the impact of depth (left, d= log2n withr2= ) and width (right, n= log2w .7withr2= ) on effective context length for the A5state tracking task, a canonical hard regular language recognition problem.",0

"C. Graph Connectivity Proof Theorem (Graph Connectivity) .There exists a (,,)-universal transformer Twith both causal and unmasked heads that, when unrolled log2n times, solves connectivity on (directed or undirected) graphs over nvertices: given the n nadjacency matrix of a graph G,n3 padding tokens, and s, t {, . . .",0

"Similar to the proof of Lem. A., the feedforward layer reads = sgn( h /(2n)), computes z= ( + ReLU( ))/, and writes zto the residual stream.",0
"Next, we can apply standard arguments (Merrill et al., ; Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023a;b) to show that the self-attention and feedforward sublayers can both be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, and the size remains polynomial (though a larger polynomial).",0

We present a new pipeline designed for the robust inference of cosmological parameters using both secondand third-order shear statistics.,0
We compress the three-point functions into the mass aperture statistic M3 ap for a set of simulated shear maps designed to model the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year data.,0

We present our findings for all relevant cosmological and systematic uncertainty parameters and discuss the complementarity of third-order and second-order statistics.,0
"Full shear three-point function measurements typically yield us data vectors with large dimensions, which are not optimal for covariance determination.",0
[] shows that the information content of the full three-point function is similar to that of the mass aperture statistic ( M3 ap ).,0
"We construct a theoretical model for the mass aperture statistic, estimate its covariance through simulations, and build a robust likelihood for cosmological analyses.",0
"In section II, we describe our theoretical model for the three-point correlation function and the mass aperture statistic, including the modeling of observational systematics and a description of our neural network emulator.",0
"B. Second and third order shear statistics To capture the Gaussian information of the shear field, we traditionally rely on two-point statistics.",0
"[] and write P ( ) =9 2 mH4 4c4Z 0d qi( )qj( ) a2( )P  , z( ) , Analogously, we can extract more information if we move beyond the Gaussian features of the field and consider its three-point statistics.",0
We theoretically model the matter power spectrum and the matter bispectrum in order to have a starting point to compute our n-point shear statistics.,0
"Similarly, we model the matter bispectrum with the BiHalofit formula [], which is shown to match the perturbation level calculation on Planck cosmology to an accuracy of % on scales with k <3hMpc .",0
"For three-point statistics, the traditional convention is to project the shear of a given point over the line that connects it to a chosen center of the triangle, which can be either the orthocenter or the centroid.",0
[] a fast algorithm to go from the matter bispectrum to the natural components of the shear three-point correlation function by performing a multipole expansion of the bispectrum.,0
C. Mass aperture statistics The mass aperture is a single measurement of the convergence signal within a circular patch.,0
"While the average convergence is, by construction, zero, we can get second-order and third-order shear information by analyzing the moments of the mass aperture.",0
"Particularly, the skewness of the mass aperture, given by M3 ap , is an efficient way to compress the third-order information that would rather be scattered along multiple triangle configurations on the three-point correlation function.",0
The mass aperture statistic can be computed either as an integral of the bispectrum or directly from the natural components of the 3PCF.,0
"We opt for the second approach, which allows us to have a theory model consistent with TreeCorr [] measurements of the mass aperture.",0
"In addition to computing the M3 ap ( ) with the DES-Y3 redshift source redshift bin integration kernels, our pipeline also computes the redshift-dependent M3 ap ( , z), which can be transformed into the full mass aperture with a line-of-sight integral.",0
This gives us the advantage of making all the three-point and mass aperture integration independent of the source galaxy redshift distribution.,0
"For higher-order statistics, it is important to maintain consistent IA modeling between second and third order correlations.",0
"F. Emulator for redshift-dependent mass aperture We build a neural network emulator for the mass aperture statistic, in order to speed up our cosmological inference pipeline.",0
"The sum of the neutrino masses m is not included as an emulator input because its dependence is not captured by the BiHalofit modeling, which is calibrated on simulations with fixed m = .06eV.",0
"Nonetheless, we do not expect this to yield any biases due to current lensing data lacking sensitivity to constrain neutrino masses.",0
A joint analysis of secondand third-order shear statistics requires modeling the covariance matrix of the joint data vector.,0
"Panels show the aperture mass statistic as a function of filter radii for different redshift-bin combinations ( i, j, k ) indicated on the upper right corner of each panel.",0
We also include a red line indicating a theoretical calculation with an artificially increased intrinsic alignment signal to show the effect of this systematic on third-order statistics.,0
Cross-covariance between the two-point functions and the aperture mass statistics estimated from CosmoGridV1 simulations.,0

"Through a preliminary comparison of our simulated covariance with jackknife and bootstrap estimates from Y3 data, we verify that our current NSIDE introduces an inaccuracy in the mass aperture covariance if we do not cut our 3PCF measurements at , which is slightly larger than two times the simulation pixel size.",0

"We use our simulated covariance to compute the total signal-to-noise ratio over all redshift bin combinations, finding it to be S/N=.",0
"In order for our likelihood model to bring robust contours on parameter space, we must accurately model three components of our covariance: the two-point correlations, the mass aperture, and the cross-covariance between both (Figures , , and ).",0
"The amplitude of both covariances is also consistent, with the average ratio of their diagonal elements being sufficiently close to unity.",0
"The cross-covariance between two-point and threepoint information is also not significant, and there is no structure on the matrix, as can be seen in Figure .",0
"Normalizing the full covariance matrix so that it has a diagonal equal to unity, we find that the largest value forthe cross-covariance equals .",0
"Even though it would be reasonable to expect that the (i,i) sections of the data vector would correlate with the (i,i,i) section of the M3 ap vector, at least more than with the other parts of the M3 ap vector, this effect can be suppressed by the S/N discrepancy between the statistics.",0
We adopt a non-Gaussian likelihood in order to accurately propagate the variance of our covariance matrix into our final parameter constraints.,0
"It has been shown by Sellentin and Heavens [] that, when using a covariance matrix estimated from simulations, a marginalization over the inverse-Wishart distribution of the true underlying covariance will yield a likelihood that follows a modified multivariate t-distribution.",0
An alternative approach is to use a Gaussian likelihood and rescale the inverse covariance by the multiplicative factors introduced by Hartlap et al.,0
"Here Nreal= is the number of simulations used to estimate the covariance, and mis a factor given by m=Np+ +Nreal +fD +fD, with Npbeing the number of model free parameters and fDthe Dodelson-Schneider factor [], which is a function of Nreal,Np, and the dimension of the data vector Nd: TABLE II.",0
We compute the inverse covariance using the measured covariance matrix from our CosmoGridV1 realizations described in Section III.,0
"The lower part of the table includes MOPED compression of the data vectors, which is discussed in Section IV B.Our fiducial data vector includes the +and functions for two-point statistics, as well as the M3 ap function for three-point correlations.",0
"For the mass aperture part of the data vector, we used our full set of data points, which correspond to four aperture values for each of the redshift bin combinations.",0
"For the modeling of the 2PCF theoretical vector, we utilize the existing modules in the cosmosis-standard-library , a supplemental library tailored for cosmology analysis.",0
"B. Data compression As we have seen in the last section, the dimension of the joint analysis data vector grows up to , which is comparable to the number of CosmoGridV1 simulations used for covariance estimate.",0
"In this case, the Hartlap factor can be significant, and even with the Hartlap factor, the simulation-based inverse covariance fails to describe the true covariant structure of the data vector elements.",0
"In this algorithm, we transform the original data vector to a compressed data vector using a linear transformation, d BT d, where the transformation matrix Bis the twodimensional matrix with shape ( Nd, Np), being Npthe dimension of the model parameter vector.",0
"The transformation matrix is designed to maximize the Fisher information after compression, and it is shown that the compression conserves the Fisher information.",0
One possibility that emerges is to use the rough estimate of the inverse covariance matrix from a small number of simulations.,0
"If we use a covariance derived with a simulation number comparable to the dimension of the data vector, the inverse variance of the data elements can be misestimated and the compression matrix can upweight the noisy data vector elements by mistake.",0
Figure shows how much our constraints from the two-point function can be overconfident when we use the simulation-based covariance from a small number of simulations to estimate the compression matrix.,0
"For this reason, we perform a partial data compression only on the 2PCF part of the data vector, for which we have an analytic model of the covariance matrix.",0
"The red contour is obtained with the MOPED compressed data vector, where the compression matrix is estimated with the analytic covariance while the simulation-based covariance is used in the likelihood during parameter inference.",0
"The blue contour is similar to the red contour, but the simulation-based covariance is used for the estimate of the compression matrix.",0
The red contour is slightly larger than the gray due to the difference between the CosmoGridV1 input cosmology and that of the analytic covariance.,0
The confidence region of the compressed data analysis is slightly larger than that of the original contour due to the larger cosmological amplitude parameter used in CosmoGridV1 simulations relative to that of the analytic covariance.,0
"With the estimated compression matrix for 2PCF, we define the compression matrix for the full data vector by forming the block diagonal matrix.",0
"Thus, we validate our analysis pipeline by performing parameter inference on a simulated data vector at CosmoGridV1 cosmology.",0
"The baryonic effect on matter clustering can be interpreted as the outward displacement of the matter particles in the host halo due to the baryonic physics, e.g. AGN feedback, star formation or gas heating.",0
"As a result, the baryonic effect prevents matter clustering at small scales, leading to the suppression in the matter powerand bispectra [].",0
"To this end, we generate a synthetic data vector of the 2PCF and the mass aperture that includes a baryonic effect similar in amplitude to that of the OWLS simulations [].",0
"For third-order shear statistics, we start by computing the suppression factor for the matter bispectrum through the fitting formula in Appendix C of Takahashi et al.",0
"In order to have a consistent baryonic effect between 2PCF and third-order shear statistics, we rescale the suppression factor accordingly.",0
"Using the suppressed matter bispectrum, we compute the shear 3PCF and mass aperture statistics, and perform a run of our pipeline on the baryon-contaminated data vector.",0
We use our CosmoGridV1 simulated covariance and perform MOPED compression on the data vector before concatenating it with the mass aperture information. ...,0
"The gray contour is the constraint from alone, while the colored contours are constraints the addition of the third order mass aperture statistic.",0
"With CDM modeling, we find that adding the autocorrelations of the mass aperture increases the FoM on the m-S8plane by %, while adding the full mass aperture data improves the 2PCF constraints on mS8by %.",0
"Adding the high signal-to-noise redshift bin combinations (,,) and (,,) of the mass aperture along with its auto-correlations only slightly increased the gain relative to the scenario restricted to the auto-correlations.",0
"This shows us that, despite those combinations bringing important contributions to the signal, it is still necessary to combine low and high redshift information to achieve the full constraining power of the mass aperture.",0
"To verify the adequacy of our 2PCF and mass aperture scale cuts in removing effects from baryonic physics, we run our pipeline on our baryon-contaminated data vector which mimics the baryonic effect present in the OWLS simulations (see Section IV C for the detail).",0
This indicates that our choice of scale cuts for 2PCF and mass aperture is large enough to cut out the small-scale data vector elements that are more sensitive to the baryonic effect.,0
"Here we use the same data vector as in our previous CDM analyses, but we allow the equation-of-state parameter w0of dark energy to freely vary within the prior range specified in Table III.",0
"Despite the negligible S8andw0individual gains, the improvement in the w0-S8figure-of-merit was found to be of %, indicating that mass aperture data helps to break the existing w0-S8degeneracy.",0
"The gray constraint uses 2PCF data alone, the red constraint uses both 2PCF and mass aperture, and the green constraint uses mass aperture data alone.",0
"As the amplitude of gravitational lensing is larger for higher source redshift bins due to the larger line-of-sight coverage, the relative contribution of intrinsic alignment is larger at lower redshift bins.",0
CONCLUSIONS We have presented results from a pipeline to obtain robust constraints on cosmological parameters using secondand third-order shear statistics.,0
The full configuration and redshift-dependent shear three-point correlations are measured from simulated shear catalogs and compressed for computational efficiency into the third moment of the mass aperture statistic M3 ap .,0
"We compute the combined likelihood of the two-point functions and of M3 ap , including the covariance matrix from a set of CosmoGridV1 shear maps.",0
"The combined effect on a joint analysis is a negligible shift in S8(below .1 ), and thus one of robustness to baryonic feedback relative to that of the individual summary statistics.",0
The gain in the m-S8FoM that we find with the full three-point correlation raises interesting questions regarding the use of higher order statistics (HOS).,0
"[] compare the m-S8FoM gain from third moments, scattering transforms, and wavelet phase harmonics, with each yielding improvements of %, % and % relative to second moments alone.",0
"Interestingly, for three-dimensional clustering analyses, recent findings suggest that the power spectrum and bispectrum come close to saturating the information content [].",0

"Algorithmiq Ltd., Kanavakatu 3C, FIHelsinki, Finland )Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, P.O. Box , FIUniversity of Helsinki, Finland An attractive way to include nuclear quantum effects in calculations is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr dinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei.",0
"This method is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method in the chemistry literature, but it is also known by many other names such as the multicomponent or the non Born Oppenheimer method in physics literature.",0
"However, two types of basis sets are required for NEO calculations: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set.",0
"In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions.",0
"I. INTRODUCTION Nuclear quantum effects, such as zero-point energy, proton delocalization, and quantum tunneling play crucial roles in many aspects of chemistry, biology and material science.",0
"An issue to note on the topic of NEO methods is the lack of standard terminology in the literature: the same method is known under several names, which is a symptom of the novelty of the field and also relates to the breadth of possible applications since the masses and charges of the quantum particles are input parameters in the solution of the coupled Schr dinger equations, the same methodology can also be used for calculations on, e.g., positrons9or muons10in atoms and molecules.",0
"As our main interest is in quantum nuclei (protons and deuteriums) and since the term NEO appears to be most widely used in chemistry, we prefer to use that term in this work, but point out that NEO methods are also widely referred to a)Electronic mail: susi.lehtola@alumni.helsinki.fias multicomponent methods or non-Born Oppenheimer methods in the wider literature.",0

"Early works employed various approaches: for example, even-tempered basis sets generated from the vibrational frequencies of the hydrogen molecule,61doubles, p, d nuclear (DZSDPN) basis sets,6or minimal 1sprotonic basissets.",0

"Conventional quantum chemistry employs Gaussian basis functions of the type r| i =Nirliexp( ir2)Ymi li( , ) where Niis a normalization constant, and Ym l( , )is a spherical harmonic.",0
"The contractions are motivated by the nucleus being a point particle in conventional calculations, which means that molecular orbitals tend to behave similarly to atomic orbitals close to the nuclei: core orbitals are insensitive to the chemical environment and do not participate significantly to chemical bonding.",0
"However, as we will show in section IV, this is no longer the case in NEO calculations: the quantum nuclei are no longer point charges, and the electron-nuclear Coulomb potential thus behaves differently close to the center of the nuclear charge distribution.",0
"As NEO calculations do not feature point nuclei, guided by established experience with nuclear spin-spin-coupling78and x-ray calculations79that demonstrate that basis sets should not be contracted when studying properties that are sensitive to the near-core region, we check whether the standard trick of uncontracting the electronic basis set on the quantum protons will result in better basis set convergence also in NEO calculations.",0
"Uncontracting the basis sets eliminates the contraction error and allows more freedom in the protonic orbital shape close to the center of the nuclear distribution, which greatly enhances the basis-set convergence of the NEO calculation.",0

"RESULTS The usual goal in quantum chemistry is to reach chemical accuracy, often considered as kcal/mol of the exact result.",0
"However, it is important to distinguish here between the two possible sources of error: the basis set truncation error, and the error inherent in the method employed in the calculations, as differences between computational results and either experiment or accurate theoretical reference values are always a mixture of the two effects.",0
"Access to such converged PAs then allow comparison to experiment, elucidating the error inherent in the employed density functional method, and also enables the training and learning of more accurate density functionals for NEO, for example.",0
"Since the changes in the electronic structure induced by the quantum protons are likely localized to the close proximity of the quantum protons themselves, we will only study uncontractions of the electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, and use contracted basis functions on all the other nuclei.",0
"Uncontracting the electronic basis set on the quantum nuclei in the unchqbasis sets leads to remarkable improvement in the accuracy of the calculations: the basis set truncation error in the PAs in the polarized double, triple, and quadruplebasis sets is reduced at least an order of magnitude to kcal/mol, kcal/mol, and kcal/mol, respectively, reducing the basis set truncation error by kcal/mol, kcal/mol, and kcal/mol, respectively; these values correspond to contraction errors.",0
"Typically, only some of the hydrogen atoms are modeled as quantum particles, and the uncontraction of the quantum hydrogen basis introduces a mere , , , and basis functions in the doubleto quintupleaugpc-, aug-pc-, aug-pc-, and aug-pcbasis sets, respectively, while the unmodified basis sets have a total of , , , and basis functions per hydrogen atom.",0
"Uncontractingthebasis set on the quantum hydrogens again results in marked reductions in the basis set truncation error, even thoughthe reductions are not as large as with the Jensen basis sets.",0
"However, as comparison to the results in fig. shows, largely the same level of accuracy can be reached by simply uncontracting the original Dunning electronic basis set on the quantum hydrogen.",0
"Noticeable reductions in the basis set truncation error are once again observed when uncontracting the basis set on the quantum protons, but the effects are somewhat smaller than in previous cases.",0
"AND DISCUSSION We studied reaching the basis set limit in density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the nuclearelectronic orbital (NEO) method: like other types of NEO methods, NEO-DFT calculations require two types of basis sets to be employed.",0
"We examined calculations withtheJensenpolarization-consistentbasissets,65Dunning s correlation consistent basis sets,39as well as Karlsruhe basis sets.68Diffuse basis functions were included on all atoms.",0
"As the quantum protons no longer behave like point particles and are instead delocalized over a spatial domain, previous experience with nuclear spin-spincoupling78and x-ray calculations79suggested a simple improvement of the electronic basis in NEO calculations simply by uncontracting it on the quantum protons.",0
"We find that more work is needed to determine cohesive and systematic protonic basis sets, and error-balanced pairingsthereof with electronic basis sets for an optimal approach to nuclear-electronic structure calculations, as the basis sets of Yu, Pavo evi , and Hammes-Schiffer41appear to be too large for doubleor tripleelectronic basis sets.",0

"Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss.",0
"The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates.",0
Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally.,0
"Direct in-situ observations of these turbulent fluxes from atmosphere to ocean rely on measuring the covariances of turbulent fluctuations: x= au w , y= av w , QS= acpw T , QL= aLew q .",0
The same algorithm is used in coupled weather and climate models to compute flux based on prognostic state variables of the oceanic and atmospheric surfaces.,0
The widely used flux algorithms are termed bulk algorithms since they use bulk quantities of the surface layer to model the surface fluxes.,0
"Sensitivity studies have shown that changing bulk algorithms can considerably affect atmospheric dynamics, e.g. in terms of Madden Julian Oscillation (Hsu et al., ), precipitation (Harrop et al., ), general circulation (Polichtchouk & Shepherd, ), and oceanic state, e.g. in terms of sea surface temperature (Bonino et al., ).",0
"Flux products also suffer from uncertainty in bulk algorithms, in addition to uncertainty in bulk inputs, as discussed in Yu .",0
"As a result, eddy-covariance (EC) measurements remain our best ground-truth for calibrating bulk algorithms, despite their sparsity and intrinsic measurement uncertainty (Gleckler & Weare, ).",0
We use a quality-controlled research ship cruise dataset provided by NOAA Physical Sciences Lab (PSL) to develop an alternative data-driven flux algorithm using artificial neural networks (ANNs).,0
"Recent advances in machine learning methods have led to their applications to surface flux parameterization, see e.g. McCandless et al.",0
Earlier attempts to replace iterative bulk algorithms with computationally efficient neural networks date back to Bourras et al. .,0
"Bulk algorithms are simplified representations of the underlying dynamical processes and, at best, represent a statistically averaged value of fluxes given the observables.",0
"More complex formulas such as sea-state-dependent parameterization (Edson et al., ; Bouin et al., ) have been proposed that incorporate surface wave physics (one of the sources of additional variability) but have not yet been fully validated and widely adopted.",0
"In this study, we aim to quantify the uncertainty (variability) around deterministic flux algorithms from EC data, while taking an agnostic perspective on the source of uncertainty.",0
This is achieved by developing a probabilistic air-sea flux model based on conditional parametric probability distributions.,0
"This class of parametric models uses a finite number of parameters to represent the underlying probability distribution (Nix & Weigend, ; Barnes et al., ) and has been successfully applied to geophysical problems (Guillaumin & Zanna, ; Schreck et al., ).",0
"An estimate of uncertainty around deterministic bulk algorithms will benefit uncertainty quantification in downstream applications such as flux product development, and the development and testing of stochastic air-sea flux parameterization in weather and climate models.",0
"We implement our probabilistic flux algorithm in the single-column General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM, Umlauf and Burchard ) to study the effects on the upper ocean states.",0
"The paper is organized as follows: in Section , we describe the dataset, the mathematical model, and the training procedure of ANN; in Section , we evaluate the ANN predictions compared to the baseline bulk algorithm and examine aspects of the learned flux model; in Section , the results of both deterministic and stochastic tests in GOTM are reported.",0
Data and model Direct in-situ covariance measurements The air-sea flux observation dataset we use is collected by decades of research cruises conducted by NOAA PSL.,0
"There are about , samples after quality control, and all are ship-borne, hourly-averaged covariance measurements according to Equation .",0
"We assume that each flux component yofYfollows a uni-variate conditional Gaussian distribution with mean (X) and standard deviation (std) (X): y N( (X), 2(X)).",0
"In particular, as shown in Figure (b), we use two ANNs to represent the mean and the variance 2 for each flux component.",0
"We do not include the heights at which the meteorological variables are measured, although they are used as inputs to existing bulk algorithms.",0
"Briefly summarized here, we first train the networks on mean square error loss and then on negative log-likelihood loss (Equation ).",0
"For simplicity, we denote the mean predictions as ( x, y, QS, QL) and variance predictions as ( 2 x, 2 y, 2 QS, 2 QL), omitting subscript and .",0
"We evaluate these metrics for the ANN-based deterministic prediction ( x, y, QS, QL) compared to a baseline bulk algorithm ( x,b, ,QS,b,QL,b).",0
"Without additional input features (such as surface wave information), it is reasonable to accept zero prediction as is in bulk algorithms.",0
(a) ANN-based deterministic predictions (orange dots) and bulk algorithm predictions (black dots) plotted against measured fluxes.,0
"Unlike bulk algorithms that assume QS,b S(Ta To), the structure of ANN is more flexible, allowing non-zero flux values even when Ta=To.",0
"Tests: surface flux forced upper ocean mixing As a preliminary test for the proposed probabilistic air-sea flux model, we choose to implement it in the single column model GOTM (Umlauf & Burchard, ), which provides a controlled environment with no complex interplay with other nonlinear processes in GCMs.",0
"The governing equations are a set of 1D diffusion-type equations tu= zw u +fv, tv= zw v fu, tT= zw T , tS= zw S , where the prognostic variables are the horizontal velocity components uandv(subject to Coriolis force), temperature T, and salinity S.",0
"In particular, we test our air-sea flux algorithms in combination with two ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL) mixing parameterizations: the K-profile-parameterization (KPP) scheme (Large et al., ) and a more sophisticated second-order closure k scheme (Umlauf & Burchard, ), both used in GCMs but typically under different resolutions.",0
"We also plot two bulk algorithms COARE and NCAR (Large & Yeager, ) to show that ANN deviations exceed those between different bulk algorithms.",0
"Within a period of high THF around Oct , ANN predicts the least extreme negative values while NCAR predicts the most extreme negative value, reflecting all three algorithms divergence at high wind speed, where few measurements exist to constrain them.",0
"(b) Hovm oller diagram of temperature vertical profile over time, in the ANN flux forced case ( kscheme -minute time stepping).",0
"We assume no covariance between the sensible and latent heat flux residuals, therefore, the uncertainty of their sum simply follows 2 Q= 2 QS+ 2 QL.",0
It is also interesting to note that the bulk algorithm predicted THF is generally within Q. There are two parts of the ANN-based probabilistic model to test.,0
"First, we want to evaluate the effects of changing the flux algorithm from COARE to ANN-predicted mean in deterministic runs.",0
"However, changing OSBL parameterization typically induces a consistent year-round trend KPP leads to a shallower mixed layer and warmer SST whereas changing flux algorithm exhibits seasonality.",0
"This suggests that improving air-sea flux algorithms can potentially help correct seasonal MLD biases, which OSBL refinements alone may not fully address.",0
This ensemble of forced simulations provides an estimate of the variability in SST and MLD induced by the variability of THF.,0
Stateof-the-art bulk algorithms represent the statistical mean of eddy-covariance flux observations for a given set of state variables.,0
"Tests using OWS Papa data and a single-column model show that the difference in THF between the two algorithms estimates exhibits signs of seasonality, so as the response of upper ocean states, despite of rather small magnitudes.",0
"We comment that the current framework can also be used to estimate the standard deviation around a given mean estimation, e.g. any existing bulk algorithm.",0
"The ANN model uses a limited set of input variables, which is likely the reason why the improvement over the existing algorithm is marginal.",0
"Further improvement is possible since several additional variables are measured and available in the dataset (e.g. turbulent kinetic energy), but we need to consider that many of them are not yet prognostic variables in GCMs.",0
"The height dependence is difficult to learn from the current data set alone, because there is little variance in the measurement height, but incorporating data from other measurement platforms (e.g. buoy data) might help.",0
"The model can be extended to a multi-variate one by including the covariance between flux components, and the Gaussian assumption can be relaxed, given that we have more data to train a more complicated statistical model.",0
"While existing bulk algorithms represent the mean values of turbulent fluxes given limited input variables, our approach takes a step towards examining the variability around the mean values.",0

"Although it is possible to train both the mean and the variance ANNs on negative log-likelihood directly, we found that training on the MSE loss first allows the mean ANN to capture more variability in the data.",0

"[, ] tuned to a photon energy above the absorption edge creates a sufficiently large population of 1s core-hole excited states.",0
This limitation can be overcome by replacing the random spontaneous emission within the sample by an external tunable seed pulse that can be scanned across the photon energy of the multiplet lines that comprise the K spectrum.,0
"We performed seeded S-XES experiments for two Mn complexes that have different electronic structures resulting in very different multiplet structures in their respective intermediate and final states: NaMn(VII)O4, which is formally a d0complex exhibiting only one transition in its K 1spectrum, and MnCl(II), which is nominally a d5high spin S=/2complex exhibiting five main transitions (and additional weaker ones) in its K 1spectrum as calculated by charge transfer multiplet simulations.",0
"One section generated the keV pump pulse, and the other generated a tunable seed pulse tunable around the keV Mn K 1photon energy.",0
"A second detector was placed upstream to analyze the seed pulse thus providing information on the number of incoming seed photons, seed photon energy and seed pulse spectral shape.",0
Here we set the seed pulse photon energy well below the Mn K 1line and optimized the focus until a seeded S-XES signal appeared.,0

"the K 1transition, the seeded S-XES signal slowly gains strength as more and more seed photons are present at the transition energy.",0

Figure (top) shows the experimental MnCl2K 1spontaneous XES spectrum (dashed orange curve) together with the simulated spectrum (solid orange curve).,0
"Indicated by the black arrows are three spectral features at , , , and eV. These features consistently appear in all cases, independent of the seed pulse energy.",0
"To show the existence and position of these additional features, we apply a peak finder algorithm that identifies peaks and their corresponding energies.",0
The result for MnCl2is shown in Figure 4A. For each seed energy (vertical axis) the results of the peak finder algorithm are plotted (horizontal axis).,0
The green triangles show the results of the seed pulse photon energy as detected by the upstream detector and therefore appear on the diagonal.,0
"In addition to the peaks found on the diagonal (i.e. the seed pulse), additional peaks were found that appear at the same photon energy, independent of the seed pulse energy.",0
"From this analysis method, four energy regions are found that are highlighted in Figure by light blue vertical bars as guide to the eye.",0
We also find a considerable difference between the energy positions of the calculated (yellow) and measured (red) transitions.,0
"As this depends on the spectral width and intensity of the seed pulse, this can in principle be controlled with better seed pulse optimization.",0
The results of the peak finder algorithm for the seeded stimulated XES experiment on NaMnO4is shown in Figure 4B. Only one peak (besides that of the seed pulse) is found at eV as highlighted by the vertical light blue bar.,0
An interesting phenomenon in the NaMnO4seeded SXES peaks shown in Figure 4B is that the energy position of the transitions shifts to slightly lower energies when the seed pulse crosses to energies below the K 1transition.,0
"We attribute this behavior to a coupled oscillator effect that pulls the stimulated emission signal towards the seed pulse energy, which is a well know phenomena in both the laser and FEL communities.",0
"In line to the experiment, Figure 5A illustrates that the position of the K 1signal shifts when the seed pulse energy crosses the transition energy with a maximum pulling of eV. While the spectra shift with the seed pulse, the number of stimulated photons is always highest when the seed is resonant with transition, which is illustrated in Figure 5B.",0

"Without bid requirements, Marmer, Shneyerov, and Xu show that the marginal bidder s expected profit is non-increasing in the entry probability p, resulting in a unique symmetric entry equilibrium.",0

"Under the reserve price format, the marginal bidder s expected revenue is monotonically decreasing in the entry probability and has relatively large values for small entry probabilities.",0
"Note that in this low-price auction setting, the bidder s expected revenue from entry is an increasing function of the reserve price r. Since (v|p)/ p < 0andC22(F(v), p) , it follows that a lower reserve price corresponds to a smaller probability of entry in equilibrium.",0

"For example, in the empirical section below, we MANAGING PROCUREMENT AUCTION FAILURE find that the probability of entry can be smaller or larger, depending on the number of potential bidders, under the reserve price format in the TxDoT setting.",0
"Nevertheless, even when the probability of entry is larger under the reserve price format, the probability of bidding is lower than that under the bid requirement format.",0

"Nevertheless, the probability of bidding is always larger in under the bid requirement format, and the differences can be substantial.",0
"Despite that, the probability of auction failure is substantially higher under the bid requirement format in auctions with nbetween , and it is very similar in auctions with nequal .",0

"Similarly, the reserve price format dominates in terms of the expected winning bid by % %of the engineer s estimate, depending on the number of potential bidders, with larger differences for smaller n. We conclude that, at the estimated level of signal informativeness = , the reserve price format is preferred in terms of auction failure probability and expected winning bid, even at the aggressively set reserve price corresponding to the -th percentile of the distribution of private costs.",0
"Such levels of the entry cost result in a small probability of entry and, consequently, a large probability of exactly one active bidder, in which case, an auction is canceled under the bid requirement format.",0
"For the bid requirement format to be preferred, it requires a sufficiently low entry cost to substantially reduce the probability of having one entering bidder. .",0
"Therefore, to study the effect of signal informativeness on auction failure, we can focus on the effect of on the equilibrium probability of entry.22For that purpose, we can look at the effect of on the marginal bidder s revenue from entry, see Figure .",0
"For example, if the marginal bidder s expected revenue from entry is a decreasing function of the signal informativeness at all relevant entry probabilities p, the (stable) equilibrium entry probability (under the bid requirement format) would be a decreasing function of .",0

"Similarly, we use p(n, ; )to denote the equilibrium entry probability in the stable non-trivial equilibrium, provided it exists.",0
"The information effect reduces the expected cost of procurement, but the cutoff effect is ambiguous because, under more informative signals, the equilibrium entry probability can be larger or smaller. .",0

"In particular, the reserve price format has a smaller auction failure probability under more informative signals, that is, when >.",0
Recall that the probability of auction failure is monotonically decreasing in the entry probabilities under both formats.,0

Box , Annaba, Algeri a 2Centre for Engineering Quantum Systems, School of Mathemat ics and Physics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland , A ustralia We discover three novel classes of pulse-train waveforms in an optical Kerr nonlinear medium possessing all orders of dispersion up to the fourth order.",0
"A distinguishing property is that these structures have di erent amplitudes, widths and wavenumbe rs but equal velocity which depends on the three dispersion parameters.",0
"The results show thatthose optical waves are genera l, in the sense that nospeci ed conditions on the material parameters are assumed.",0
"Considering the lon g-wave limit, the derived pulse-trains degenerate to soliton pulses of the quartic and dipole kinds .",0
The formation of such wave packets in a monomode optical ber r esults from the exact balance between the pulse-spreading e ects of group-velocity dispersion and self-pha se modulation e ects due to the intensity-dependent refractive index of the ber [].,0
"Experimental observation of solito ns have been reported in various optical systems, including single-mode optical bers [], femtosecond lasers [] and bu lk optical materials [].",0
"In such a situation, extensions of the NLSE model that take into acco unt the in uence of diverse physical phenomena on short-pulse propagation and generation are therefore essentia l to describe the wave dynamics accurately.",0
It can be relevant to note that such kind of pulse shape is interesting in itself as anothe r type of physically relevant nonlinear waves in optical bers besides the soliton-type waveform.,0
"For example, the formation of cno idal wave has been recently demonstrated in a ber laser either in the net normal or net anomalous cavity dispers ion regime [].",0
"Importantly, such arrays of pulses may be created by the modulational instability of the continuo us-wave signal [], or from a dual-frequency pump [].",0
"In optics, such nonlinear waves play a pivotal role in the ana lysis of the data transmission in ber-optic telecommunications links [].",0
It is pertinent to mention that the nding of such structures may lead to novel dyna mical behaviors of waves and opens the possibility for experimental investigations of various wave phenomena.,0
Section II provides the analytic framework necessary to nd the traveling wave solutions of the extended NLSE model that governs the transmiss ion of extremely short pulses throught an optical ber medium exhibiting all orders of dispersion up to the fourth orde r.,0

"Top-Down and Bottom-Up Algorithms From the explanations that arein the paper, I suppose I can guess roughly what cdshould do.",0
Richard was studying the relationship between top-down and bottom-up algorithms that solve problems specified recursively on some input data structure.,0
"[td ""abc"", td ""abd"", td ""acd"", td ""bcd"" ...] If such a function cd'could be constructed, a bottom-up algorithm computing the same solution astdwould be given by bu':: (a -> s) -> (L s -> s) -> L a -> s bu'f g = head .",0
"The type checker took care of most of the proof, using the indices to keep track of the tree shapes throughout the transcription.",0
"The whole point of programming with inductive families [Dybjer ] such as Bn kis to say more and prove less : encode more properties in the indices, so that those properties are automatically taken care of as programs construct and deconstruct indexed data, requiring fewer manual proofs.",0
"It s a rather complex extension of Bn k, but I think I ll be fine if I stick to the same programming methodology: perform pattern matching on the indices, and specify what should be in the tree in each case.",0
"The goal types of the even-numbered holes are all b, and the odd-numbered holes require proofs that the even-numbered holes are equal to h z for all the -sublists z of""abcd"" .",0
"But the refined cdwould need to manipulate the equality proofs in those trees, and maybe eventually I d still be doing essentially the same tedious equational reasoning that I wanted to avoid.",0
"Despite having a proof now, I think I m going to have to delve into the definitions of tdandbuanyway, to get a clearer picture of their relationship.",0
"In functional programming, naturality usually stems from parametric polymorphism: all parametric functions, such as cdandunTip , satisfy naturality.",0
"I ve seen how dramatically string diagrams simplify proofs using naturality, so it s probably worthwhile to take a look at the two algorithms from a string-diagrammatic perspective.",0
"More importantly, some notions that prove to be useful in functional programming (such as naturality) can be defined generically on categories and systematically transported to other settings.",0
"I go through the types of the components used in the algorithms (Section ) to find a common form, and it seems that the simplest version suffices: given an index type a:Set, a category of families Fam ahas objects of type Fam :Set Set Fam a=a Set and morphisms of type :Fam a Fam a Set p q= {x} p x q x That is, a morphism from ptoqis a family of functions between corresponding types (with the same index) in pandq.",0
"Formally, this is stated as a naturality equation (where fneeds to be lifted appropriately): retabulate mapBTf=mapBT(mapBTf) retabulate With functor composition, in general there can be many functor layers in an object (like the target ofretabulate ), and all these layers can be transformed independently by natural transformations.",0
"If I can prove that their table construction phases are equal, then I ll have another proof that the two algorithms are equal, in addition to the parametricity-based proof (Section ).",0
So I should do an induction that uses this equation to rotate the right-leaning tree in tdand obtain the left-leaning tree in bu(Figure ).,0
"And then I ll need to prove the equation, meaning that I ll need to go through the definitions of retabulate andblank ...",0
"Usually they make proofs more complex, but not in this case because the proof doesn t look into any of the function definitions.",0
"As long as the type is blank nested tables, the two sides of an equation can be arbitrarily complicated, and I can still prove them equal just by using BT-isProp .",0
"Oh well, rotation is still interesting because it helps to explain how the two algorithms are related intensionally: they produce the same layers of tables but in opposite orders, and rotation helps to show how one order can be rewritten into the other (Figure ).",0
"Conceptually I ve figured it all out: both algorithms have two phases modulo naturality; their table demolition phases are exactly the same, and their table construction phases are equal due to the BT-isProp reasoning.",0
"Still, I can t help feeling that I ve neglected a fundamental aspect of the problem: why the bottomup algorithm is more efficient.",0
String diagrams make it easier for me to see that the table construction phases of both algorithms produce the same layers of tables but in opposite orders.,0
"Only the order used by the bottomup algorithm allows table construction and demolition to be interleaved, and consequently the algorithm needs no more than two layers of tables at any time.",0
"The bottom-up algorithm never gets to three layers of tables, and therefore avoids recomputing solutions for overlapping subproblems.",0
"It s easy to poke holes in the reasoning for example, if the input list has duplicate elements, then the bottom-up algorithm won t be able to entirely avoid recomputing solutions of overlapping subproblems.",0
"Eventually I may arrive at something general about dynamic programming, which was what Richard wanted to work out in his paper.",0
"AFTERWORD This work is presented as a kind of Socratic monologue , recording the thought processes of a functional programmer as they solve a programming mystery.",0
"We put emphasis on intuitive explanations, and give formal definitions, theorems, and proofs only when necessary: we usually rely on intuitive reasoning to tackle a problem at first, and do not hurry to write things down formally.",0
"But we do not intend this paper to be a tutorial on dependently typed programming in Agda or on category theory the paper is best thought of as a companion to such tutorials or textbooks, giving a larger but not overly complicated example, and applying the abstract tools to that example.",0
"To make the paper more accessible, we have also resisted the temptation to generalise or to answer every question: for example, we do not generalise ImmediateSublistInduction for dynamic programming more broadly (as Bird [] attempted to do); we leave the question of whether the type of retabulate uniquely determines the extensional behaviour of its inhabitants as a conjecture (Section ); and we avoid digressions into topics such as how data types like BTcan be derived systematically (Section ) and whether BTis a graded comonad (Section ).",0
"To cover all the examples in the paper, Bird s generic bottom-up algorithm also employed a form of nexus, but it is not needed for the sublists problem and thus omitted in our work.",0
"In the case of dependent types, they can be expressive enough to replace traditional (equational) specifications and proofs.",0
"This approach to program correctness and program equality is still under-explored, and has potential to reduce proof burdens drastically.",0
"More importantly, the categorical abstraction enables the use of string diagrams to simplify proofs about functoriality and naturality.",0
"[Coecke and Kissinger ; Hinze and Marsden ] the proof simplification can be even more dramatic, although many of those properties are highly abstract.",0
"Our comparison between diagrammatic and traditional equational reasoning (Figures and , and Figures and ) should be a good, albeit modest, demonstration of the power of string diagrams in a more practical, algorithmic scenario.",0

Abstract This paper designs a high-order positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for a linear hyperbolic equation.,0
MSC code2 more Introduction and literature review The main objective of this paper is to design a high-order positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for a linear hyperbolic equation (see equation ).,0
"In [], the authors combine Strang operator splitting with a discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization to achieve high-order accuracy in both space and time for the VlasovPossion equations.",0
"It is quite challenging to prove that the resulting schemes retain high-order accuracy, positivity, as well as preserve other desirable quantities (such as: moAugmented DG method for linear hyperbolic equation mentum, energy, and so on).",0
"Optimization techniques have been used to enforce that the DG approximation is non-negative everywhere, for instance [,].",0
"Similarly, the works in [,,] also leverage optimization procedures to obtain bound-preserving schemes, but they do not consider function space augmentation, which is the primary focus of the current work.",0

", N y}, where Xkis a standard polynomial space such as Pk(space of all polynomials up to degree k),Qk(space of tensor-product polynomials of degree k), or the serendipity space Sk(for details, see []) with polynomial degree k .",0
This is accomplished by utilizing an optimization algorithm which numerically searches for appropriate basis functions to augment the standard DG spaces.,0
"The augmented basis function (denoted by ) is treated as an Augmented DG method for linear hyperbolic equation ansatz (we select a polynomial of degree r > k ), and search for coefficients of (via nonlinear programming) which ensure that the cell average of the unmodulated DG solution remains positive.",0
"Augmenting polynomial basis Here we provide an algorithm that generates a special basis function; such that, when it is augmented to the standard DG spaces, it will preserve a positive cell average for the unmodulated DG solution.",0
"In full generality, this optimization problem can be numerically resolved on each troubled cell locally by using nonlinear programming techniques such as the interior point method [].",0
"Let G Sijbe this set of finitely many points (e.g., tensor product Gauss quadrature rules of sufficiently large precision).",0
Each optimization step of Problem starts with an initial guess for d(the coefficients for the candidate augmented basis function ).,0
"Essentially, they solve a constrained optimization problem where the entire solution is constrained (or modified) to be nonnegative.",0
"Other possibilities include (but are not limited to) modifying the objective function (e.g., log barrier/penalty methods for remote initial guesses), augmenting multiple basis functions to a standard DG Augmented DG method for linear hyperbolic equation space, or requesting posses certain properties (e.g., vanishes at the outflow boundaries).",0
"It is worth pointing out that these SIP and MP optimization techniques assume that is a compact set, which automatically rules out non-compact sets such as {( , ) : >, > , ,}.",0
"As such, there exists ev eXk(S) = Xk(S) span{ }that simultaneously satisfies evand L(eu,ev) =Z Seu dx dy, Augmented DG method for linear hyperbolic equation for any eu eXk(S) (where L( , ) is defined in ).",0
This suggests we may weaken the condition which enforces that the test function vfrom is non-negative on an entire cell Sij.,0
"Let the set G2Dcontain the abscissa on cell Sijfrom a tensor product quadrature rule with non-negative weights (such as the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature [,]).",0
"Similarly, in 3D, the set G3Dcontains the abscissa on cell Sij from a tensor product quadrature rule with non-negative weights.",0
The condition v is enforced because we need Maurice S. Fabien the right hand side of to be non-negative to guarantee a non-negative cell average.,0

Recent developments in Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) offer a promising tool for addressing these challenges.,0

"We assume the random variables N+( +) and N ( ) are distributed according to probability distributions Q+( +) and Q ( ) onR, respectively.",0
These parametric families of probability distributions capture the uncertainty in market order arrivals for different spreads.,0
"However, assuming a deterministic policy not only limits our choice of possible policies but also poses difficulties when modifying the market-making problem into a robust optimization setting.",0
"Specifically, we define a stochastic policy ( |S, Q) to be a probability density function (pdf) for the variables = ( +, ) (R+)2given the state (S, Q).",0
"The assumption in this paper is that Q ( ) is transformed from an unknown meta-distribution Q , where the transformation is shifted by mean f ( ) and scaled by standard deviation h ( ), as in equation .",0
This structure enables a decision-independent Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework that accommodates uncertainty in both buy and sell order arrivals.,0

We calculate the energy shift of the nuclear clock transition frequency in229Th due to the Coulomb eld of atomic electrons.,0
"The relative frequency shift between Th IV and Th V ions is found t o be , which is twelve orders of magnitude larger than the projected uncertainty o f the nuclear clock transition frequency.",0

INTRODUCTION Thenucleusofthe229Thisotopehastheuniquefeature ofhavingaverylow-energyexcitedstateconnectedtothe ground state by a magnetic dipole (M1) transition (see, e.g. Reviews [, ] and references therein).",0
"A still higher accuracy is expected for a nuclear clock with trapped ions [, ], because of the absence of the crystal electric and magnetic elds and because of the ultralow temperatures that are attainable with laser cooling.",0
"In addition, there are strong arguments that this nuclear clock would be very sensitive to physics beyond the standard model, including space-time variationof the fundamental constants, violation of Lorentz invariance and the Einstein equivalence principle, and search for scalar and axion dark matter elds [ ].",0
"This is due to the Coulomb interaction of atomic electrons with the nucleus, leading to the signi cant electronic shift ofthe nucleartransition frequency.",0
"Speci cally, the electronic shifts in Th IV, Th III, Th II ions and v. ambaum@unsw.edu.au v.dzuba@unsw.edu.au ekkehard.peik@ptb.deneutral Th atom have been calculated in Ref.",0
"This ion has zero electron angular momentum in the ground state, e ectively eliminating magnetic interaction e ects for the electron shell, including the hyper ne structure in the nuclear clock transition.",0
"Additionally, Th V exhibits minimal entanglement between electronicandnuclearvariables,whichisadvantageousas such entanglement could introduce signi cant systematic e ects.",0
"Since electrons interact with black-body radiation and stray elds many orders of magnitude stronger thanthe nucleus, eliminatinge ects ofthisinteractionon the nucleus helps to improve the stability and accuracy of the nuclear clock.",0
"Since Th V does not possess an optical electronic resonance in the wavelength range of readily available lasers, the readout of the nuclear state can be performed via a co-trapped quantum logic ion that will also provide sympathetic laser cooling [].",0
"The charge-to-mass ratios q/mare relatively closefortheseions: .0175for229ThV, .0208for48CaII and for88Sr II (in units of e/amu).",0
"In the present work we discuss bene ts of using Th V ion for a nuclear clock, consider the e ect of electrons on the nuclear transition frequency, including the change of the frequency between Th V and other Th ions.",0
"Additionally, we calculate energy levels of Th V. Electronic structure of the Th V ion was studied theoretically in Ref.",0
"We perform calculations of energy levels for both even and odd states, ionisation potential and the e ect of electrons on the nuclear clock frequency.",0
Experimentally known energy levels of the La IV ion are used to control the accuracy of the calculations in the present work and in Ref.,0
"The Th V ion has no hyper ne structure in its groundstate, and its nuclearmagnetic moment, nuclear electric quadrupole moment, and nuclear polarizability are negligible on the atomic scale.",0
Because the nuclear spin of229Th is a half-integer (I= / in the nuclear ground state and I = / for the isomer) a small rst-order frequency shift with the magnetic eld strength is present for all Zeeman components of the nuclear transition in the Th V electronic ground state.,0
The most notable remaining systematic frequency shift in the229Th nuclear clock is the relativistic second-order Doppler shift due to micromotion in the ion trap.,0
It has been demonstrated in our previous work [] that Coulomb interaction of atomic electrons with the nucleus leads to the signi cant shift of the nuclear transition frequency.,0
"This shift for electronic state ais given by Ea=Fa /angbracketleftr2/angbracketright, whereFais the eld shift constant of state awhich can be obtained from atomic calculations; /angbracketleftr2/angbracketrightis the change of the nuclear root-mean square radius between the excited and ground nuclear states.",0
"To improve reliability and estimate the accuracy of our results, we employ two additional methods to calculate the energy shift in Eq..",0
"Second, we treat the nuclear radius change as a perturbation and employ the random-phase approximation (RPA), which incorporates core relaxation e ects, to compute the eld shift constant F(see Appendix for details).",0
"We alsoadded the results for other Th ions obtained via change of the nuclear radius, since this method includes corrections missing in the RPA method used in Ref.",0
"Taking this value and the change of nuclear radius between the ground and isomeric nuclear states /angbracketleftr2/angbracketright= fm2, we obtain the nuclear frequency shift between Th IV and Th V ions to be MHz = 6eV.Therelativeshift | N/ N|= islargerthanprojecteduncertaintyofthefrequencymeasurement by twelve orders of magnitude.",0
"TABLE I. Field shift constants Fand their di erences F (GHz/fm2) for the ground states of Th I, Th III, Th IV and Th V ions found in di erent approaches: rst, by changing nuclear radius ( RN) and second in RPA calculations.",0
"Therefore, we estimate the accuracy of our method by comparing our calculated energy levels for La IV with the available experimental data.",0
"The e ciency is gained by reducing the size of the e ective CI matrix, which is generated using many-body perturbation theory.",0
Comparison with experiment shows satisfactory agreement for even states ( %) and very good agreement for odd states ( %).,0
Excitation energies for the Th V ion are well outside of the optical region (e.g. nm wavelength for the resonance line to the d1 state).,0
Note however that some energy intervals between excited states of Th V come close to the nuclear excitation energy N = cm .,0
"For example, if we take the rst excited state,E= cm 1and add to it the value of the nuclear frequency, we get E= cm , which is in the area where the spectrum is dense and a resonance is possible.",0

Comparison with experiment shows satisfactory agreement for even states ( %) and very good agreement for odd states ( %).,0
One signi cant di erence is that the selectrons are moved to the core and the CI equations are solved for six ( p6) or seven ( p65f) valence electrons.,0
"the relativistic Hartree-Fock operator for the atomic core, index cnumerates single-electron states in the core, cand care corresponding single-electron functions and corrections due to the eld shift operator F, and Vcoreis the change of the self-consistent HartreeFock potential due to the change in all core functions.",0

"(A5) does not take into account some minor contributions like change of the correlation operator , renormalisation of the wave function, etc.",0
"However, with the proper choice of the value for the change of nuclear radius (see, e.g. Table V) the alternative approach is likely to be signi cantly moreaccurate since it includes corrections missing in the RPA method.",0

These findings represent a further step toward the systematic exploration of polynomial algebras relevant to nuclear models.,0

"In this context, and specifically referring to the quantum mechanical framework, both generalized Casimir operators and representations are crucial to determine and interpret the spectra of quantum systems [ ].",0
"[math-ph] Mar Poisson algebras by incorporating polynomial functions, plays a significant role in describing the algebraic and geometric properties of various physical models.",0
"Their natural connection to Lie algebras, through embedding chains and representations, provides a powerful framework for understanding symmetry, conservation laws, and the dynamics of physical systems.",0
"The mathematical framework provided by embedding chains of Lie algebras into polynomial Poisson algebras is also of particular interest in the study of super-integrable systems and field theories [,].",0
"In these models, the hierarchical embedding of Lie algebras helps to organize the algebraic structure of conserved quantities and symmetries, leading to a better understanding of the (exact) solvability and stability of the system.",0
"Moreover, such embeddings also contribute to the broader field of mathematical physics by providing insight into the classification of solutions to differential equations and the quantization of classical systems.",0
A systematic investigation of polynomial algebras appeared in the study of Lie algebra reduction chains associated with nuclear models in [].,0
"Remarkably, the (cubic) polynomial algebras associated with these models were shown to be related to algebraic structures that naturally arise in the study of superintegrable systems [], highlighting their fundamental role across different physical contexts.",0

"By investigating how these polynomial structures emerge in the classical (commutative) setting, we aim to highlight the deep interplay between this type of algebraic structures and the different physical models.",0

"The discussion extends to detailing the construction of polynomial algebras in dual spaces, the latter being endowed with the Lie-Poisson (or Berezin) brackets.",0
"We describe the methods for obtaining polynomial invariants which ultimately define symmetry algebras derived from the analysis of the commutants associated with suitable subalgebras, also examining the computational efficiency of determining the commutants analytically.",0
The narrative highlights the challenge of managing polynomial decompositions while maintaining algebraic independence up to a specified degree.,0
"In Section , after introducing the reduction chain of the Lie algebra su su su associated with the supermultiplet model, we investigate the construction of homogeneous polynomials derived from the study of the commutant associated with the su su subalgebra.",0
"The analysis focuses on the explicit construction of the generators of the polynomial algebra, with a detailed discussion on the methods used to obtain them in order to overcome computational limitations.",0
These limitations arise when finding high-degree polynomial solutions to the system of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with the analysis of the commutant.,0

"Utilizing Equation , we can observe that the kernel of the adjoint representation corresponding to the subalgebra g on the universal enveloping algebra U(g) provides a framework for formulating the ensuing definition.",0
"Determining the commutant directly in the enveloping algebra is generally a cumbersome task [, ], for which reason it is computationally more efficient to consider the equivalent analytical formulation.",0

It is also crucial to recognize that elements in the generating set of a centralizer subalgebra do not automatically reflect their algebraic independence.,0

We now construct a set of linearly independent and indecomposable polynomials arising from the analysis of the commutant of the subalgebra su su in the enveloping algebra of su.,0
"Moving to the degreek= expansion, the equations yield three independent and indecomposable solutions, given by p :=s2 +s2 +s2 , p :=t2 +t2 +t2 , p :=q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 +q2 .",0
"Among the nine polynomials derived, five serve as central elements while the remaining four are intended as generators to close a polynomial algebra.",0
"To achieve closure of the algebra, an additional degree-five element must be incorporated, specifically derived from the commutant constraint with the expansion for k= .",0
"We thus have the following set composed by sixteen polynomials up to degree seven coming from a systematic analysis of the commutant related to the subalgebra su su: {b1,b2,b3,c1,C2,d1,D2,D3,D4,E1,F1,F2,F3,F4,G1,G2}.",0
"Nevertheless, it is conceivable that more efficient programming techniques, combined with the use of more powerful computers, could generate these polynomials within a more acceptable computation time.",0
"To establish closure in the polynomial algebra, it is essential to include the new generators that appear within the Berezin brackets of higher degree.",0
"At this level, by solving the algebraic equations obtained for the undetermined coefficients, we get the following: {C2,D2}= i(F1+F3),{C2,D3}= 2iF3,{C2,D4}= .",0
"These polynomials of degree seven Poisson commute with all the generators of the subalgebra and, instead of presenting their explicit expressions (which are cumbersome), we simply notice that they can be expressed as: G2= i {D2,D3}= i {D3,D4}, G = i{D2,D4} G2= i{E1,C2} G2.",0
"That said, if we manage to close a polynomial algebra by adding these two polynomials to the previous generators, then the eighteen elements: {b1,b2,b3,c1,C2,d1,D2,D3,D4,E1,F1,F2,F3,F4,G1,G2,H1,H2} would represent the minimal set of linearly independent and indecomposable generators that are necessary to reach closure.",0
"Therefore, in what follows, our efforts will focus on constructing the polynomial algebra generated by the following set composed of twenty polynomials up to degree nine (five central elements and fifteen generators): P:={ b1, b2, b3, c1, C2, d1, D2, D3, D4, E1, F1, F2, F3, F4, G1, G2, H1, H2, I1, I2}.",0

This fundamental difference necessitates new sustainability strategies tailored to edge computing s unique energy and performance demands.,0
"Furthermore, modern edge servers are increasingly required to execute machine learning services concurrently, creating resource conflicts that increase latency and reduce responsiveness [].",0

"Our architecture consists of two layers of scaling agents: in the first layer, each service is extended with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, which optimizes local SLO fulfillment by scaling resources or quality.",0

"To save energy, the LSA also minimizes the number of allocated cores ; however, this SLO can be traded off in favor of performance hence it has a lower weight ( w).",0
"With sufficient training, the LSA can be applied in resource restricted scenarios to choose between multi-dimensional elasticity strategies; this showed to improve SLO fulfillment further than a regular VPA C. Global Optimization after Resource Exhaustion The following scenario evaluates if the GSO can optimize global SLO fulfillment (= ,Alice + ,Bob) when no free resources can be allocated: We start two instances of CV called Alice and Bob which are supervised by two LSAs.",0

A special exactly solvable microscopic model is used to illustrate the interplay and tension between microscopic physics and the conventional effective-medium Maxwell equations.,0
"Introduction In Newton s corpuscular theory of light, light is composed of of tiny, massive corpuscles, and the sine law of refraction is explained using a mechanical model (proposition of book of his Principia ).",0
"In modern terms, Newton proposed that a refracting body acts as a potential well of constant depth for the corpuscles, causing a higher speed within the medium due to energy conservation.",0
"If pis constant then p only depends on the type of medium, and also is constant, and equation is Snell s law, the law of sines.",0
"The corpuscular theory of light gradually lost its status in favor of the wave theory of light, largely due to the work of C. Huygens, T. Young, and A. J. Fresnel.",0
"Nevertheless, the concept of light particles reemerged in the form of photons within the framework of quantum field theory.",0
"However, by considering the refraction of localized wave packets with definite momentum and energy, it should be possible to explain the kinematics of refraction in terms of particles, wave packets of light in vacuum and pseudo-particles1in the medium.",0
"The basic assumptions for an idealized physical scenario can be summarized as follows: Wave packets are small, with a narrow frequency range, system can be large.",0
Translational invariance in the direction parallel to the surface requires only conservation of the component of total momentum in this direction.,0
"Conservation laws Under these assumptions, wave packets behave like macroscopic particles with localized energy and momentum, and therefore must satisfy the standard conservation laws.",0
"Momentum conservation Ifthecomponentofsignalmomentumparalleltothesurfaceisconserved, andif prepresentssignalmomentum in vacuum, then Snell s law implies that signal momentum in the medium is given by p =pn. 1One could also speak of photons in the vacuum and quasiparticles in the medium, but what is meant here are macroscopic classical signals, which can be measured and observed along their path like classical particles.",0
"An argument in favor of Minkowski momentum is that it agrees with the quantum mechanical formula for the momentum pQM= kof a quasiparticle, where is Planck s constant and k= 2 / is the wavevector.",0
It is not difficult to verify that these sound waves contain a negligible amount of energy in realistic situations (section ).,0
"If the wavelength is much larger than the distance between atoms, Maxwell s equations combined with the linear relation D= Ebetween the electric displacement field Dand the electric field E, are sufficient to derive the rules of optics.",0
"The root of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy are the expressions of Minkowski and Abraham for electromagnetic momentum in a medium, in terms of the electromagnetic fields DandBorEandH. The expression should contain or should not contain the material momentum, and one source of the difficulty are the phenomenological equations D= EandH=B/ .",0
"[] of the usual Maxwell equations in matter, which replace atomic matter with an 2In the natural scenario, without an anti-reflective coating, the additional incoming and reflected the signal also transfers momentum to the surface.",0
"The signal (the gray block) moves to the right, slightly accelerates atoms at its right front to the right, and slightly decelerates atoms at its left front, thus leaving behind a trace of atoms shifted to the right, but again at rest.",0
"A sequence of pendulums of elastic spheres as a metaphor for a system where particle and signal speeds differ, and where the signal leaves behind a trace of shifted spheres.",0
"Center of energy The center of energy of a system is a rarely used concept of special relativity, which enters here in two ways.",0
"One point is that any system (a wave packet, for example) behaves as though its entire energy is concentrated at its center of energy, at least with respect to translational degrees of freedom.",0
"A general proof of this fact makes use of the continuity equations for momentum and energy [], but no such details are required here. .",0
"It is useful to now consider a slab of thickness Land mass Mperpendicular to the x-axis, and a short wave packet of momentum pand energy pcarriving from the left.",0
"In other words, refraction has shifted the contribution of the wave packet with momentum pto the center of energy by X = ( n)Lpc/  Mc2+pc =( n)Lp/(Mc) to the left.",0
The way out is to recognize that the Minkowski momentum includes a material part in such a way that the center of energy Xmoves with constant speed.,0
"However, Xmatterarises from the signal itself, and only involves a small fraction mmatterof the total slab mass M, so it does not conflict with the expression for Xslab.",0
"One might argue that for the signal to have material momentum the signal would have to carry some mass with itself with signal velocity c/n, which is absurd in an insulator, where electrons and atoms essentially stay at their place.",0
"In case of a continuous signal, all transmitted photons are delayed by the slab, yet there are no visible wave fronts that accelerate or decelerate the atoms.",0
"The solution is that the initial wave front has accelerated the atoms in its trace, and the momentum of these atoms, wherever it has gone, compensates the delay of the photons.",0
"Alternatively, the force can be interpreted as the Lorentz force j B, acting on the polarization current j= E/ t, where represents polarizability and EandBare electric and magnetic fields.",0
"These relaxation processes respect conservation of momentum and the linear movement of center of energy, and do not invalidate the general considerations.",0
Momentum transfer at the boundaries At the boundaries it is natural to assume that the momentum (pn p)is passed to a volume of approximately the same size as the signal wave packet.,0
ForE= 1Jandm= 1mgfor a wave packet of volume 1mm3in water one finds E/  mc2 = .This means that only a minuscule fraction of the energy is lost at the boundaries.,0
"actually is caused by the shifted atoms left behind by the signal, and not the entire slab mass M. Ifm is the mass of the atoms in the signal trace, then their shift X Lp m c E Ac2 is larger by a factor M/m .",0
Eq. says that the signal decays exponentially with some Figure : An optical metamaterial or a wave guide consisting of thin polarizable layers perpendicular to the z-axis.,0
"A sound velocity vt= m/s, a signal energy E= 1J, a signal extension A= 1mm and the mass density of water give a decay length of 1019m, certainly negligible also in other realistic situations.",0
For wavelengths much large than the layer spacing athe signal only sees the average capacitance per area rather than the individual layers.,0
The polarization implies a potential energy V=a 2 E2 2per layer area in the fictitious oscillators in the layer material.,0
"Together with the equations tPm=Fmfor the momenta Pmof the layers according to the forces Fmexerted on them, Eq. forms a closed set of equations.",0
"This corresponds to an incoming signal in the range < z < 0with amplitudes <=p 2 2and <= 0instead of and , with the same energy flow (incoming and reflected intensity 2removed).",0
"The mechanical momentum density can also be calculated from the Lorentz force acting on the polarization current in the layers, at the border of a signal, the result is the same.",0
It can be checked with the results in table that the center of energy of a finite signal is conserved and that the component of the momentum in the direction parallel to the surface is different outside and inside the medium.,0
"Overall, the wave guide model reproduces the signal speed and law of refraction of the corresponding continuum model, but the details differ.",0
"The polarization tensor of the corresponding three dimensional continuum model would be diagonal with components  0, 0n2, 0 or  0n2, 0n2, 0 , which makes no difference for the polarization in y-direction considered here.",0
Conclusions Wave packets in dispersion-free media move in the direction of their momentum and obey momentum conservation like particles.,0
"In any case a substantial fraction of signal momentum is of mechanical nature, and it is important to understand the corresponding internal structure of wave packets.",0
Taking into account that atoms are accelerated but essentially remain in place after the signal has passed leads to an electromagnetic system with static matter.,0
"These equations are adequate for effects determined by average polarization and magnetization (linear in the fields), but not for bilinear local terms like mechanical momentum, at least not without further input.",0

"Speeding up Local Search for the Indicator-based Subset Selection Problem by a Candidate List Strategy Keisuke Korogi, and Ryoji Tanabe, Member, IEEE Abstract In evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the indicator-based subset selection problem involves finding a subset of points that maximizes a given quality indicator.",0
"Thus, the ultimate goal of multi-objective optimization is to find a Pareto optimal solution preferred by a decision maker [].",0
"In environmental selection in indicator-based EMO algorithms (e.g., HypE []), the best kindividuals in terms of a quality indicator are needed to be selected from nindividuals in P Q.",0
"Thus, designing an effective subset selection method is beneficial from the perspective of indicator-based EMO algorithms.",0
"Thus, an effective inexact method for the ISSP can be designed by reducing the computational cost in 1Environmental selection in decomposition-based EMO algorithms [] is based on scalarizing functions and generally does not use any quality indicator.",0
A candidate list strategy [] is one of the most classical reduction approaches in the context of combinatorial optimization.,0
The indicator measures the minimum shift such that each point in Pweakly dominates at least one reference point in S. R2 calculates the average minimum values of the weighted Tchebycheff function values of Pwith respect to a weight vector set W. NR2 is an improved version of R2 that more closely approximates the HV value of P. The senergy indicator was originally proposed in the literature of mathematics.,0
The s-energy indicator evaluates the uniformity of the points in P. Let us consider the ranking of all point sets in Vby a quality indicator I.,0

"In contrast, for each iteration, LS with the candidate list strategy in Algorithm swaps kpoints in Sonly for lpoints from the corresponding candidate lists in the maximum case.",0
"However, unlike Algorithm , Algorithm needs to construct ncandidate lists for npoints in Pat the beginning of the search.",0
"In contrast, in LS with the nearest neighbor list in Algorithm , p1can be swapped only with the two nearest points ( p2,p3).",0
"In contrast, Algorithm using the nearest neighbor list LN swaps only two points close to each other in the objective space.",0
"Thus, we believe that Algorithm using LNcan 3For example, as mentioned in Section II-C, a solution of the ISSP can be represented by an n-dimensional vector.",0
Note that Algorithm using LN can indirectly swap two points far away from each other by repeatedly swapping two points close to each other on a continuous PF.,0
"For this reason, Algorithm using the nearest neighbor list is likely to perform worse than Algorithm on ISSP instances with discontinuous PFs in terms of the quality of subsets.",0
"LS using the two neighbor lists 1Initialize Srandomly; 2LR Generate the random neighbor list of P; 3S Apply Algorithm using LRtoS; 4LN Generate the nearest neighbor list of P; 5S Apply Algorithm using LNtoS; of constructing the random neighbor list is significantly lower than that of constructing the nearest neighbor list described in Section IV-B. D. Sequential use of the two neighbor lists As discussed in Section IV-C, LS using the nearest neighbor list is likely to perform poorly on an ISSP instance with a discontinuous PF.",0
"Since Algorithm uses the two lists, it requires the total time complexity of constructing them described in Sections IV-B and IV-C, respectively.",0
Our results in Section III showed that swapping two points far away from each other can improve the quality indicator value of a subset at an early stage in LS (Algorithm ).,0

"To derive the Equation of Motion (EoM), an instantaneous relative reference frame (IRRF) is used, with its main directions being LoS, radial, and out-of-plane.",0
The second term on the right-hand side of Equation is typically referred to as the centrifugal acceleration term (which from now is summarised asgc).,0
"To derive the residual range rate variables that we use in this study, CSR applied background models related to the static gravity field (GGM05C), the de-aliasing AOD1B product, and other (non-)tidal and non-gravitational accelerations.",0

"Statistics of post-fit residuals To visualise the signal content in post-fit residuals, a spatial analysis is performed.",0
"By ""spatial,"" we mean that the data is binned into latitude-longitude grids, and several statistics are computed based on the data points falling within these bins.",0
"We observed that the spatial root mean square (RMS), as well as other statistical variance estimators, such as standard deviation and median/mean absolute deviations (MdAD and MAD respectively), of the post-fit residuals offer an optimal way to visualize the different types of high-frequency signals, as opposed to other statistical measures such as the spatial mean or median.",0
"We hypothesise that an example of accelerometer artefact is particularly evident in the post-fit residuals RMS and the variances of nm/s2observed as a continuous N latitudinal band, as shown in Figure (i).",0
"The difference between the median/mean statistics (e.g. Figures 1d and 1e), which show little to no geophysical correlation, and the RMS and variances, which do exhibit such correlations, can be explained by the nature of the post-fit residuals.",0
"These residuals indicate mass anomalies relative to the monthly solutions (geo-fit), leading them to oscillate around the monthly average, causing them to superimpose and cancel each other out, resulting in a lack of any discernible pattern.",0
"Temporal characteristics of post-fit residuals Following the description of the simple binning statistics of the GRACE post-fit residuals, we now present the first temporal characterization for the same two months mentioned earlier.",0

"Here, rapid changes in water storage due to precipitation and river discharge (e.g. during monsoon seasons) contribute to the high-frequency mass change.",0
"However, we significantly expand upon these results in the following sections by providing a detailed spatial and temporal characterisation of specific examples of rapid mass change phenomena throughout the entire duration of the GRACE mission.",0
"Oceanic high-frequency mass change signals The Zapiola region, situated within the Argentine Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Argentina (centered at S W), is a unique and dynamically active area characterised by intense oceanic currents and mass change.",0
"The anticyclonic circulation around the Zapiola Rise traps water masses and sediment, leading to highly concentrated mass anomalies de Miranda et al.",0
"In terms of high-frequency mass change, the Zapiola region is significant due to the strong currents and complex interactions between the water column and seabed, which create rapid and localised mass variations.",0
The associated statistics of this classification analysis can be found in the Supplementary Information (SI)(Figure S1).,0
"Most significantly, the evolution of sub-monthly mass change is primarily characterised by a rotating pair of 3SI can be requested from the corresponding first author.",0
"A qualitative assessment, indicated by colour bands into four categories: absence (blue), uncertain (cyan), anomaly (orange), and significant anomaly (red), is shown to determine whether the observed signals are due to high-frequency mass variations.",0
"The RMS sub-monthly variability is calculated using the following equation: RMS var=vuut1 NNX i=(xi x), where Nrepresents the number of gridded daily SLA solutions xiwithin a specific month, and xis the average of all these solutions for that month.",0
The result of Equation is a grid that depicts the RMS variability of the gridded variable xiin relation to its monthly average.,0
"Furthermore, it is known that the barystatic (mass-related) component of SLAs dominates the region, while the steric component driven by variations in temperature and salinity contributes less than % to the overall regional signal Hughes et al.",0

"The negative values suggest the presence of sub-monthly positive mass anomalies resulting from pressure differences during Oswald, which were not accounted for in the AOD1B RL06 background model Ghobadi-Far et al.",0
"At similar latitudes ( SS), positive LGD deviations are noted for arcs 7b and 10b, indicating a mass deficit relative to the monthly average.",0
"This demonstrates that the monthly solutions have captured a portion of the mass (pressure) variation signals induced by Oswald, revealing an overestimation in mass prior to the cyclone s impact as indicated by the post-fit residuals.",0
"A P REPRINT To verify that these signals are related to sub-monthly geophysical phenomena, we compare spatially gridded and Gaussian filtered (radius of deg and standard deviation = ) post-fit residuals, from December to February , with sub-monthly RMS variations (using Equation ) in the ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions Mayer-G rr et al.",0
"Point-mass model analysis As a final step, we investigate whether these anomalies can directly be attributed to the moving cyclonic system.",0
We assume the cyclone to be a point mass which tries to account for the unmodelled (AOD1B) cyclonic traces in post-fit residuals.,0
"We set this mass to be constant and equal to Gt, which is a first-order estimation using spatially integrated weekly precipitation data provided by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), for the week of of January (for more details see Figure S3 in SI).",0
This mass also coincides with the integrated mass anomaly considering the cyclone s highest pressure difference variations of approx.,0
"Figure : Two examples of along-orbit post-fit LGD residuals (denoted as ""GRACE KBR""), compared to synthetic LGDs from a Gt-point mass model of the Oswald cyclone (solid line).",0
"The lack of alignment suggests that the observed post-fit residuals cannot be adequately explained by the simple Gt point-mass model, and thus we cannot confirm if the observed post-fit residuals are caused by the moving cyclonic system.",0
It is important to highlight that the majority of cases we examined displayed only partial or no alignment between the Gt point-mass cyclone model and the post-fit residuals.,0
"This misalignment A P REPRINT suggests problems with the assumption of constant (point) mass, stemming from variations in precipitation and pressure along the cyclone s landfall.",0
"As GRACE is not in proximity to the cyclone s path, the presence of unrelated mass anomalies could superimpose with the cyclone s (un)modelled signal leading to the observed lack of alignment.",0
"The significant magnitude of these anomalies, which are absent in monthly gravity field models, suggests that the cyclone s intense central pressure drop and rainfall mass redistribution are likely the primary drivers.",0
"However, the majority of cases display partial or no alignment, highlighting the limitations of the simple Gt point-mass model in capturing the complexities of the observed signal.",0
"Land hydrology high-frequency mass change signals The Ganges-Brahmaputra river basin is renowned for its significant hydrological variations, primarily due to the rainy season coinciding with the summer monsoon, which typically commences in June and concludes in mid-October.",0
"As performed in the previous section, we compare LGD post-fit residuals to the sub-monthly RMS variations (Equation ) in the ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions as can be seen in Figure .",0
We refer the reader to Figure S5 in the SI to show the effect of the standard deviation parameter on the smoothing process.,0
"Finally, a longitudinal phase shift of is evident between the spatial variations in post-fit residuals and the daily solutions, which we speculate is attributed to the incorporated hydrological model statistics in the Kalman filtering constraints and pre-applied spatial smoothing.",0
"Second, a high correlation of exists between these two time-series, confirming that post-fit residuals effectively reflect sub-monthly variabilities and that these are a consistent seasonal phenomenon that must be accounted for in regional mass change models.",0
"Conclusions In this study, we examined the use of K-band range-rate post-fit residuals from the GRACE mission provided by CSR, which were transformed into Line-of-Sight Gravity Differences (LGD), to identify and characterise high-frequency mass change signals.",0
"In the Zapiola region, we detected significant high-frequency oceanic mass change signals potentially linked to the dynamics of a rotating dipole-like mode.",0
The spatial correlations between the LGD anomalies and these daily solutions reinforced the interpretation of sub-monthly variability.,0
"Additionally, we developed a preliminary proto-mass change model that approximates the cyclone as a point mass, which effectively localised two cyclonic sub-monthly signals during one of the cyclone s peak intensities over the GoC. However, limitations in this simplified model became evident as the majority of cases have partial to no alignment with post-fit residuals, highlighting the necessity of a more advanced mass change modelling framework.",0
"Here, we introduced spatial plots of statistics and linear regression parameters, and we performed a cross-validation using the ISTG-Grace2018 daily solutions for the first time to demonstrate their sub-monthly nature.",0
"Overall, our findings underscore the value of GRACE post-fit residuals as an intermediate product, with the potential to enhance the temporal and spatial resolution of gravity-based mass change monitoring.",0
Future research will focus on leveraging these residuals to develop a framework for high-frequency mass change modelling.,0

"While the general processes of galaxy formation and the hierarchical buildup of DM halos are well-established, the intricate interplay between DM halos and the baryonic processes that drive star formation in galaxies remains a pivotal area of research in astrophysics.",0
"Central to the process of star formation is the cold interstellar medium (ISM), primarily composed of atomic hydrogen (H i) and molecular hydrogen (H ).",0
"Understanding the molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio ( MH2/MHI) is therefore crucial, as it provides insight into the efficiency of this conversion process and its implications for galaxy evolution.",0
"Turbulence can promote the mixing and compression of gas, aiding in the formation of molecular clouds (e.g., Krumholz & McKee ), while magnetic fields can provide additional support against gravitational collapse, affecting the balance between H i and H (e.g., Mouschovias ).",0
"Specifically, we analyze how the MH2/MHIand star formation efficiency in both the atomic (SFE HI, defined as SFR/M HI) and molecular (SFE H2, defined as SFR/M H2) gas phases vary with stellar mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR, defined as SFR/ M ), and DM halo mass.",0

"SDSS fiber were obtained by performing the spectral energy distribution fitting to the ugriz photometry outside the fiber, using the models and methods described in Salim et al. .",0
"The host dark matter halo mass ( Mhalo) of each central galaxy is taken from Zhao et al. , who developed new machine learning (ML) models using observable galaxy or group properties.",0
"These include the stellar mass of the central galaxy, the total stellar mass of the galaxies more massive than the mass completeness threshold in the same group, the total color matrix, group richness, and stellar age, SFR, color matrix of the central galaxy.",0
"Additionally, group halo masses are estimated separately for blue and red groups, as quenching processes can decouple the growth of the halos from that of the galaxies, complicating the mapping from group properties to halo mass.",0
"However, the SHMRs for red and blue centrals, when derived using the widely-adopted halo masses estimated through the abundance matching (AM) technique, do not align with the weak lensing measurements.",0
"As demonstrated in Zhao et al. , the halo masses derived from the new ML approach show significant differences compared to those obtained using the AM technique, particularly around the Schechter stellar mass, M .5M .",0
"Furthermore, using the improved ML-derived halo masses, the resulting halo mass function shows excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.",0
"Since the star formation in the local universe primarily occurs in galactic disks, the size of the disk component (Rdisk) closely related to the properties of the dark matter (DM) halo, particularly its mass, spin, and concentration serves as a key indicator of gas density.",0
"Interplay between sSFR, SFE and MH2/MHI It is well-known that in regular undisturbed spiral galaxies, the atomic gas extends well beyond the stellar and molecular gas disks, often reaching times their diameter.",0
"This extensive distribution of atomic gas plays a critical role in the dynamics of star formation across different scales within galaxies (e.g., Wong & Blitz ; Bigiel et al. ; Lemonias et al.",0
"It is beneficial to express SFE HIas the product of the star formation efficiency of H2(SFE H2, defined as SFR/ MH2), and the molecularto-atomic gas mass ratio, MH2/MHI.",0

"The dots in Figure show the distribution of central spiral galaxies from the ALFALFASDSS matched sample on the SFE HI-sSFR plane, with the grayscale of each dot indicating the galaxy s stellar The critical role of dark matter halos in driving star formation mass ( M ).",0
"At a given sSFR, more massive galaxies tend to exhibit larger SFE HIand lower HIcompared to lowmass systems, which is also shown in previous studies (e.g., Huang et al.",0
"The HIof the sample spans a wide range, and low-mass dwarf galaxies potentially having an Higas fraction as high as approximately % (e.g., Catinella et al. ; Hunter et al. ).",0
"Galaxies across a range of stellar masses, sizes, structures, metallicities, and environments all evolve along this fundamental relation.",0
"The relation between SFE HIand sSFR for central spiral galaxies exhibits significant scatter and is strongly dependent on the galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that H igas does not follow a similar FFR framework as H 2gas.",0
"The typical uncertainty for SFR (in star-forming galaxies) and stellar mass is dex and dex, respectively, leading to an uncertainty in sSFR of approximately dex.",0
"At a given sSFR, the MH2/MHIdecreases with decreasing M , indicating a lower efficiency in converting H ito H2in galaxies with lower masses.",0
"This reduced efficiency could be attributed to several factors, including lower metallicity and lesser gravitational binding energy in smaller galaxies, which are less conducive to the processes necessary for H 2formation.",0
"As H igas, the raw material for forming H , is depleted faster than it can be replenished also indicated by the low gas-to-mass ratio ( %, as shown by the purple dot-dashed line in Figure ) the H 2gas will also deplete quickly.",0
Influence of halo mass on the SFE and M H2/MHI ratio Figure illustrates the SFE-M halorelation (left panels) and (M H2/MHI)-Mhalorelation (right panels) for central spirals in the ALFALFA-SDSS matched sample.,0
"In the left panels, star-forming central spirals, represented by blue contours, show an upward trend in SFE HI with increasing halo mass.",0
This suggests that the halo mass plays a crucial role in regulating the conversion efficiency from H igas to stars within these galaxies and the conversion of H igas to stars is more efficient in more massive halos.,0
"This independence is depicted by a horizontal dashed line in the left panel, indicating that SFE H2remains consistent across different halo masses for a given sSFR.",0
"For star-forming galaxies, the conversion process from H ito H 2also becomes significantly more efficient in more massive halos, ultimately achieving the equilibrium where the depletion timescales for H iand H2are equal, illustrated by the gray dashed line.",0
"According to these studies, the gravitational potential of the DM halo contributes to the overall vertical stability and structure of the galactic disk.",0
Ignoring the gravitational potential of the DM halo can lead to a significant underestimation of the vertical baryon density near the disk mid-plane.,0
"Theoretically, the stronger gravitational potential provided by DM causes gas to settle more tightly within the disk, increasing its surface density (e.g., Su arezMadrigal et al. ).",0
"Higher mid-plane pressure, often associated with more massive DM halos, enhances the conditions required for the formation of molecular clouds.",0
"As a result, galaxies embedded in more massive DM halos should have a higher MH2/MHIratio, reflecting a more efficient conversion of H ito H 2and leading to an increased SFR.",0
"This indirect impact of the DM halo is also expected to be particularly crucial in low-mass galaxies, where the baryonic mass (gas and stars) alone may not provide sufficient gravitational potential to stabilize the vertical structure.",0
"In these low-mass galaxies, the gravitational influence of the DM halo becomes critical for maintaining the disk s vertical equilibrium, supporting higher mid-plane pressure, and promoting more efficient Hi-to-H 2conversion and star formation.",0
"As shown in both panels in Figure , when the halo mass exceeds 1012M , galaxies are predominantly quenched, as indicated by the red contours.",0
"However, the average halo mass (and also stellar mass) of passive galaxies is significantly higher than that of star-forming galaxies.",0
"These represent very different populations: for example, local star-forming galaxies with halo masses around .6M (the peak of the blue contours) are not progenitors of the passive galaxies with halo masses around .5M (the peak of the red contours).",0
"These findings suggest that more massive halos, specifically those with masses greater than 1012M , significantly influence the quenching of galaxies by inhibiting the conversion of gas into stars and suppressing star formation activities.",0
"According to this theory, ones a halo reaches a critical mass, it transitions from cold accretion to hot accretion and it can retain hot gas in a virialized state.",0
"Additionally, this process highlights the importance of halo mass in regulating star formation and the overall growth of galaxies. .",0
"In the theoretical framework, the size of these disks (R disk), which we use as a proxy for gas density, is primarily determined by the properties of the dark matter (DM) halo, especially its mass, spin and concentration.",0
"This trend is particularly evident for halos with masses below 1012M , where cold accretion mode dominates the gas supply.",0
"The virial radius, which represents the boundary within which the halo is in approximate virial equilibrium, scales directly with halo mass and affects the overall gravitational potential.",0
"Larger DM halos, with greater virial radii, create deeper gravitational potential wells, which support more extended disks.",0
"Therefore, the combined effects of halo spin, concentration, and mass collectively determine disk size, which in turn influence the gas density, star formation efficiency, and gas composition.",0
Results at different stellar mass bins Stellar mass is a fundamental property that influences local gravity and correlates with nearly all galaxy properties.,0
"Given the strong correlation between halo mass Dou et al. and stellar mass, particularly for star-forming galaxies, we analyze the ALFALFA-SDSS sample by dividing it into three fixed stellar mass bins to help disentangle the influences of M haloand M , as shown in Figure .",0
"The upper panels of Figure show the average DM halo mass (M halo), while the lower panels show the average disk radius (R disk) on the SFE HI-sSFR plane, calculated using a moving box of dex in sSFR and SFE HI.",0
"For lower mass galaxies ( <logM (M )<), as shown in the left panels, the SFE HIand the conversion from H ito H 2increase with higher halo mass and smaller disk radius, suggesting that DM halo mass, halo spin and concentration play a significant role in regulating the available gas for star formation in low-mass systems.",0
"As shown in the upper right panel, when the halo mass of the galaxy exceeds 1012M , the average sSFR falls below Gyr , indicating that these galaxies are quenched.",0
"In these massive galaxies, DM halo mass plays a crucial role in governing the onset of quenching, consistent with the halo quenching scenario.",0
Galaxies of intermediate stellar masses ( <log M (M )<) display the combined regulatory influences of both halo mass and disk size.,0
"These galaxies show that the halo begins to exert a quenching effect once the mass reaches a critical threshold, typically around 1012M , marking a transition in the galaxy s evolution characterized by reduced star formation activity.",0
"Overall, Figure provides a comprehensive view of how various properties of dark matter halos, including spin, concentration, and mass, collectively influence galaxy evolution.",0
"Halo spin and concentration play a crucial role in determining internal galactic structure, such as disk size, which regulates the conversion of H i to H 2and affects star formation rates across different stellar masses.",0
"In low-mass galaxies (where most halos have masses less than 1012M ), the dark matter halo promotes the conversion of H i to H 2gas primarily through cold accretion mode, in which gas flows smoothly into the galaxy and sustains star formation.",0
"In massive galaxies (log M (M )>), the halo transitions to a hot accretion mode, where the gas is shock-heated upon entry into the halo.",0
"As shown in Figure , in principle, there are two distinct paths (labeled as and ) by which galaxies can progress to join the cloud of quenched galaxies in massive halos.",0
"Due to the rapid decline in specific halo accretion rates over cosmic time, halos can only significantly increase their mass at high redshifts, with limited mass growth at z < (e.g., Peng & Maiolino ).",0
"Starforming galaxies form a relatively tight, single sequence on this plane, without any significant bending at higher halo masses.",0
"In this state, galaxies have an elevated H 2conversion efficiency within massive halos, resulting in high star formation rates and short gas depletion timescales.",0
"The average halo mass M halo(upper panels) and disk radius R disk(lower panels) on the SFE HI-sSFR plane for central spirals in the ALFALFA-SDSS matched sample, obtained by using a moving box of size dex in sSFR and dex in SFE HI.",0
"As the halo mass continues to grow, it eventually surpasses halo mass threshold for shock heating and entering hot mode (e.g., Birnboim & Dekel ; Dekel & Birnboim ; Kere s et al. ).",0
"At this point, galaxies evolve almost vertically downward on the plot, with only modest increases in halo mass towards z = , as illustrated by route .",0
It should be noted that the threshold halo mass for transitioning from cold mode to hot mode accretion increases with redshift.,0
"This explains why quenched galaxies are concentrated in the high-mass region (M halo .5M ), which is significantly more massive than where present-day star-forming galaxies are typically found.",0
"Using the ALFALFA-SDSS matched sample, with careful joint incompleteness corrections for both the ALFALFA and SDSS samples, and the Fundamental Formation Relation (FFR; Dou et al. 2021a,b) derived from local H observations, we investigate the interrelationships between key galaxy properties related to star formation, with particular emphasis on the impact of dark matter halos, using the improved halo masses derived by Zhao et al. .",0

"While the overall distribution is consistent with previous findings, a key difference is the absence of the low-mass peak in the red (quenched) population.",0
"In Renzini & Peng , the quenched galaxy population exhibits a double-peaked mass distribution, with the low-mass peak attributed to environmental quenching processes affecting satellite galaxies.",0
"As a result, the low-mass peak of the red cloud is missing, reflecting the intrinsic differences between the central and satellite galaxy populations.",0

"In this work, we will contribute to both of these goals by developing a new and faster technique for an essential objective in distributed computation breaking symmetry between large substructures of the input instance and use this technique to design distributed algorithms that obtain improved complexity bounds for the fundamental problem of -coloring (where denotes the maximum degree of the input graph).",0

Observe that this sufficient condition is equivalent to the statement that the contention digraph C(R, G) does not contain any edges.",0
"As such, on a high level our overall approach to proving Theorem can be summarized as follows: iteratively decrease the degree of the nodes in the contention digraph by removing subgraphs from Rwhile simultaneously making sure that we do not remove too many subgraphs from Rto not violate the property stated in the second bullet of Theorem .",0
"In the fourth step (which comprises the bulk of the algorithm in terms of runtime), we iteratively switch between further reducing the maximum outdegree and the maximum indegree of the contention digraph.",0
"When the distance of the relations represented by the aforementioned virtual graph exceeds k, the contention digraph has finally lost all of its edges, guaranteeing the property stated in the first bullet of Theorem .",0
"By carefully balancing the parameters in the above approach, we ensure that for each member of Rthat is removed, the distance to the closest remaining member of Rdoes not increase too much, thereby guaranteeing the property stated in the second bullet of Theorem .",0
"The procedure ( EliminationWalk , Algorithm ) just has each subgraph walk a token on the stem of its orchid, and tokens (and their corresponding subgraphs) are deleted according to a simple rule: whenever a node contains more than one token during a round, all but one of them is eliminated.",0

"Note further that if q k/d < for the universal constant q used in Algorithm ( RulingSubgraphs ), then RulingSubgraphs terminates after executing subroutine RulingOrchids and outputs R2.",0
"We start by observing that the lengths of the walks taken by the tokens in DirectionalEliminationWalk are bounded by k: this simply follows from the facts that each token enters at most k/ddifferent orchids for the first time (due to Lemma ), that each walk towards the Algorithm DirectionalEliminationWalk , on subgraph family R2 Throughout the algorithm, whenever there are multiple tokens at the same node at the same time, all but the one of highest ID are deleted.",0
"(Note that the computation of a shortest path towards an orchid s stem can be performed in rounds during the algorithm by simply storing the entire topology of any orchid Hin every node of H, which can be achieved by a precomputation of O(t+d) O(k) rounds, by the definition of a ( t, d)-orchid.",0
"Analogously to the proof of Lemma , we obtain that this postmortem walk is of length kand ends in a node of a subgraph whose corresponding token survived DirectionalEliminationWalk .",0

"Put together, the cost of simulating in Ga round of communication over the sibling graph and the runtime of the ruling set algorithm over the sibling graph result in a complexity of at most O((t+d+d(i) log)(log(i)k+log n)) rounds.",0
"Step 4b: Indegree reduction by pausing walk Similarly to how DirectionalEliminationWalk from Section is able to reduce the maximum indegree of the considered contention digraph to something of the order of the maximum outdegree of the contention digraph, in this section, we describe and analyze an algorithm for reducing the indegree of the contention digraph following the outdegree reduction from the previous section.",0

Note that the computation of the branch nodes at the beginning of the algorithm can be performed in rounds (allowing some precomputation whose complexity is dominated by O(k)) analogously to the proof of Lemma .,0
"With the same argument as in the proofs of Lemmas and (based on the notion of a postmortem walk), we also obtain that each subgraph contained in Ra i\ Rb iis at distance at most O(k) from some subgraph contained in Rb i.",0
"Finally, we observe that the maximum outdegree of C(Rb i, G) is at most ( log(i)k)/ since Rb i Ra iand the lemma assumes outdegmax(Ra i) (log(i)k)/. Putting Everything Together In this section, we finally prove Theorem by showing that the set of subgraphs computed by Algorithm satisfies the conditions given in Theorem and bounding the runtime of Algorithm .",0

"Algorithm then applies EliminationWalk andRulingOrchids , which by Lemmas and results in orchids of the the resulting family R2being at distance at least d+ in Gand bounds the maximum outdegree of the contention digraph of R2toO(k/d).",0

Consequences in the Randomized Setting Our techniques in the deterministic setting from previous sections also imply faster randomized algorithms.,0
"In this section, we present the faster randomized algorithms that we obtain by combining algorithmic approaches from prior work with our newer techniques.",0

:Apply Algorithm to get a ruling family R R overH. :Each node at distance dor more from the subgraph Hparticipates in T-node sampling.,0
The main idea behind the speedup we get in randomized LOCAL compared to deterministic LOCAL relies in the sampling of T-nodes (Algorithm ).,0
"As each T-node has Algorithm T-nodes Sampling, with conflict distance b :Each node selects itself with probability / b :Each selected node with a selected node in its distancebneighborhood unselects itself :Each remaining selected node becomes a T-node; it picks a pair of unconnected neighbors uniformly at random and marks them.",0

"Areas of the graph which do not expand necessarily contain locally -extendable subgraphs, which can be exploited by nodes in those parts of the graph to color themselves efficiently, as in the deterministic algorithms.",0
"In particular, conditioning on some arbitrary set of random choices within distance r of a node v, the random choices made at the ( 16logn) nodes at distance between r and rfrom vhave a high probability of creating a path between vand a T-node.",0
"This is because for each node ureachable from vthrough an unmarked path of length r, where the distanceneighborhood of uhas not yet made its random choice in T-node sampling, there is a probability at least ( / ) that the path ends up leading to a T-node through unmarked nodes.",0
"That is, there is a probability at least (/ ) that ugets selected as T-node, and a similar probability that a neighbor of uis selected asT-node.",0
Either uor one of its neighbor has a probability at least ( / ) of marking a pair of neighbors with does not remove the unmarked path between uandv.,0
"Lemma gives us that if there is usuch that there is a path of unmarked and unselected nodes from vtou, then after applying the marking process, and removing nodes, uor one of its neighbors becomes a T-node with probability ( / ).",0
"We use Theorem , but with some changes to RulingOrchids where instead of computing a (,log )-ruling set on line , the algorithm will do a ( , O(log log n))-ruling set which can be done in O(log log n) rounds in randomized (Lemma ).",0

Five mature seeds (w ith aryls) were placed in each Petri dish and with two hol es of cm in diameter at each end of their base s (covered with weights to avoid the force of the wind and al low the passage of the ants) at different distances and orientations.,0
"The variable an alyzed was the percentag e of predation and was analyzed by an analysis of the uni variate variance, with the factors being the distance and the orientation.",0

This paper explores various forms of human inputs to AI and examines how human explanations can guide machine learning models toward automated judgments and explanations that align more closely with human concepts.,0
"Keywords human-AI interaction, explainable AI, synergistic human-AI systems, user interface, artificial intelligence, design, adaptive interfaces, user experience .",0
"However, human explanations offer other advantages, allowing machine learning (ML) that is more aligned with human reasoning, and can itself be explained in more human-like ways.",0
"This will create a series of examples of different kinds of user explanations, which raises algorithmic (Section ), architectural (Section ), and even social challenges (Section ).",0
"During learning a human expert may provide labeled training examples, which are used to create a model such as a neural network, decision tree or rule set.",0
"For example, in Query-by-Browsing (QbB; see Fig. ), the user looks through a database listing selecting some records of interest and rejecting others; after a while the system infers an SQL query [ ].",0
"labeling Training data is often labeled, but users may also be explicitly asked to label data items for which the algorithm has low confidence, or to help verify learnt rules.",0
One variant of QbB used a genetic algorithm to generate conjunctive rules displayed in a query-by-example-style tableau [ ].,0
"These user explanations can be regarded as constraints on the algorithm, saying that when the system makes a decision about this case, the specified features or rules should be part of the process that gave rise to it.",0
"It is easy to only provide specified features in the training data for a machine learning algorithm that is, making use of the global explanation .",0
"For decision trees or rules determined by a genetic algorithm, this may be a fairly straightforward change to the fitness function For DNNs this might be encouraged by adding the criteria explicitly into pinch-point layers [ ], or creating clouds of generated data around the key examples classified by the criteria. .",0
"Assuming the user does not retract X as part of this process, the system now needs to relearn including X, but also has properties A, B, ... that can and should be part of the local decision around X. Note that, while the underlying ML algorithms are different, these explanations are like those suggested for Query-by-Browsing.",0
"However, there the explanations were about a single item, whereas here the user explanation was in response to a counterfactual and is effectively making a distinction X is different from Y because of A. This raises further algorithmic challenges.",0
"Feeding-back importance measures While Query-by-Browsing demonstrates the effectiveness of binary feature selection in database query contexts, other domains and situations may benefit from a more fine-grained approach to feature importance.",0
"Modern LLMs often employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) techniques [ ], where they present multiple alternative responses and ask users to select the most appropriate one.",0
Algorithmic implications In the previous section we saw types of explanations which the user might present to the system: hard feature constraints that say that a feature must be included in the way that a data item is classified.,0
"Finally, the way these are incorporated into a model might be my (re)starting machine learning from scratch, whereas others may use incremental learning, updating the existing model.",0
"We have not dealt with these issues explicitly in the potential approaches below, but they each add to the algorithmic challenges. .",0
"Another option is to build a tree as normal and then force the key decisions back into the tree as modifications bottom-up from the leaf node where X is classified, pruning or rebuilding sub-trees.",0
"This is similar to how decision tree algorithms typically use information gain or Gini impurity, but with an additional weighting factor based on user-provided importance values.",0
Intermediate level features and user generated vocabulary One way to deal with new intermediate level features algorithmically is to separately build a classifier for each new feature and then add these to the input features.,0
Architectural implications Supporting human explanations as part of AI system development requires rethinking traditional machine learning architectures.,0
"We have explored several mechanisms for capturing these explanations, from feature constraints to free-text rationales, and proposed ways to incorporate them into machine learning systems.",0
"This work opens up several promising research directions: Developing algorithms that can effectively incorporate human explanations while maintaining model performance and generalization capabilities, particularly handling cases where explanations may conflict or require careful balance with patterns in the training data Creating frameworks for translating different forms of human explanation from feature constraints to free text into actionable guidance for machine learning systems Investigating how human explanations might help identify and mitigate algorithmic bias, potentially leading to more transparent and trustworthy AI systems Extending these approaches beyond QbB to different types of machine learning models and application domains, exploring how various AI architectures might benefit from human explanatory input The incorporation of human explanations into AI systems represents a significant shift in how we think about human-AI interaction.",0

"Interestingly, while the more complex optimization models yield better overall welfare results, the improvements over simpler methods are small.",0
"More importantly, we demonstrate that the increased complexity of planning approaches generally makes them more vulnerable to input uncertainty, reflecting the bias-variance tradeoff.",0
The problem presents itself as a dynamic optimization problem with a structure similar to the one presented in the seminal work of Bellman16.,0
These objectives can range from optimizing travel time18or distance and safety indicators19over minimizing cost and investments20to maximizing connectedness and directness of routes expressed in a set-covering mixed-integer linear programming (MILP).,0
"Many approaches combine multiple quality measures in a weighted multiple criteria function to represent the costs and benefits of all stakeholders involved22, 23or employ Pareto-optimization to identify different feasible networks, for example based on the trade-off in travel times between bike and car traffic24.",0
"Typically, to solve these problems on a large scale, various simplifications are required to enable the evaluation of the objective function or the optimization process itself, such as heuristic search of the possible extension pathways, aggregation and linearization techniques to simplify complex computations, or treating the optimization as a Markov chain problem and iteratively finding the next expansion steps based on the current network state instead of computing the all expansion steps at once.",0
"Here, we aim to bridge this research gap by directly comparing the suggested expansion steps from a state-of-the-art mathematical programming model recently published by Paulsen & Rich7, 8to a dynamic percolation model suggested by Steinacker et al.32for planning the cycling superhighway network of Copenhagen with the same underlying network and routing data.",0
"Although the analysis of the results of the mathematical programming model indicates a small optimality gap, its practical implementation remains challenging due to its complexity and reliance on various inputs that are difficult to predict accurately.",0
"Firstly, we show that the dynamic percolation model32is extendable to a wide range of objective functions, including an approximation of the social welfare function used in the mathematical programming model7.",0
"Thirdly, the more complicated models, here exemplified by the direct optimization model with a complex welfare function, tend to be more susceptible to the uncertainty of input data.",0
This exemplifies the bias-variance trade-off in predictive planning and suggests that more complex models do not necessarily render more reliable predictions in practice.,0
"What is often overlooked is that such optimization models are subject to the bias-variance trade-off37, a concept from statistics and machine learning.",0

"As a reference approach in this paper, we employ iterative batched optimization of newly constructed cycle superhighway segments for each year of the planning period to maximize the net present value at the end of the planning period8.",0
"Additionally, we test a simplified greedy optimization approach based on a linear interpolation of cyclists route choices between the original and the fully upgraded network.",0
"The linearized evaluation of the objective function avoids the explicit calculation of the routes during the optimization, thus enabling a faster solution to the optimization problem.",0
"Expanding the network from the base state, both optimization algorithms explicitly include time-dependent information in the evaluation, such as budgets and discounting future benefits to extrapolate the value of the objective function at the end of the planning period.",0
"Starting from a fully upgraded network, the algorithm iteratively removes the least important bike path, generating a sequence of extensions in inverse order (Fig. ).",0

"In contrast, for the simpler models, including the greedy optimization, changes in the ordering are more likely to also result in better performance.",0
"Overall, variations in the build order and correlation of the ranking of the segment importance (see Supplementary Note , Fig. S5) confirm the qualitative observations: more complex optimization algorithms are typically more susceptible to inaccurate input data.",0
"While direct optimization approaches achieve a higher net present value, our results show that abstract conceptual planning approaches may achieve comparable performance with simpler and often more robust evaluation functions.",0
"In contrast, the direct optimization approaches construct the network from the ground up with explicit reference to the budgetary constraints7, .",0
This method achieves better performance for the explicit optimization goal and is likely more suitable for constructing accurate expansion plans later in the planning process when all parameters and conditions are known sufficiently accurately.,0
"However, simplifications to the optimization problem, like the linearization of travel time improvements (see Methods), seem to result in more disconnected bike paths in intermediate network stages compared to other approaches that focus on conceptual measures and put more emphasis structural properties of the networks.",0
"Furthermore, the prioritization and actual implementation of extension measures requires much more information than can be represented in any algorithmic model.",0
"Additional robustness analyses may provide more detailed insights on the variability of the planned extensions with respect to such model extensions, for example more detailed route choice models or additional optimization criteria representing costs and benefits for other road users and stakeholders.",0
"Our algorithmic planning approaches may also help to identify critical extensions that, if proven unfeasible or too costly in these stages, would result in large changes of the suggested network expansion.",0

"Relativistic gyrating particles, forced by a solenoidal magnetic field over some length of their trajectory, move in a helical path and undergo emission or absorption of radiations stimulated by a resonance RF field.",0
Theoretical and experimental investigations on electron beams indicate that when the action of the RF field exceeds a critical value the beam jumps abruptly to a coherent radiative system undergoing CMC in which most electrons are accumulated to a discrete energy with the same gyration phase.,0
The mechanism of CMC was proved to be an elementary cooling process that is common to dissipative systems consisting of a driving field and oscillators with a stable energy.,0
It leads to the generation of a coherent beam of particles that provides means to control miscellaneous particle induced reactions.,0
Introduction The invention of beam cooling has opened up new ways of reducing drastically the six dimensional momentum-space phase-space volume of a particle beam in the storage-ring [-].,0
"Generally, cooling particle beams is similar to cooling matter in that the thermal movement of particles in a beam, i.e., the random relative motion of constituent particles is reduced as matter does at a low temperature.",0
"However, the cooling times achieved in the conventional cooling schemes are extremely long even for a weak intensity of particles stored in a ring typically in the range from one second to one hour for a proton beam of a few hundred MeV .",0
"It is noted that most cooling schemes of transverse phase-space so far developed are based on the mechanism of spontaneous transfer of the thermal movement of a particle beam to a low temperature reservoir through heat conduction or radiation, and none has been developed based on the stimulated cooling mechanism.",0
"According to the principle of cyclotron maser cooling (CMC), relativistic gyrating particles are forced to move in a helical path and interact with an RF field over some length of their trajectory within an action time of the field.",0
"In this case, incorporating the relativistic effects and the stimulating field action on gyrations of particles reveals remarkable non-linear features in the particle beam.",0
"This dramatically enhances the thermal transfer by stimulated emission or absorption of radiations, removing drawbacks of the present cooling schemes such as the slow cooling speed and the limitations on the energy and the intensity of particle beams to be cooled [-].",0
Of particular interest is that CMC is in principle applicable to any kind of charged particles with any energy and results in an extraordinarily rapid cooling in the transverse energy-time phase-space together with the cooling in the longitudinal energy-time phase-space simultaneously [].,0
The theory has shown that the abrupt appearance of CMC is ascribed to the phase transition of electrons to a coherent state and leads to a coherent charged particle beam in which all free or quasi-free particles are in the same phase and energy.,0
"This beam can behave in a completely ordered way, in which the action of any particle is correlated with the action of all the others.",0
"The coherent particle beam will open new means to control miscellaneous particle induced reactions through the enhancement of reaction rate, particularly in the cases of coherent electron beam, to generate coherent photons of X and -rays []. .",0
Basic Concept of CMC Beam particles are often fermions and hence a quantum formulation of CMC for the particles somehow should incorporate Fermi statistics.,0
"In conventional particle accelerators and storage rings, the current of the beam particles to be cooled is usually not so large and the beam energy is relativistically high.",0
"Thus inter-particle interactions through Coulomb repulsion can be disregarded because of its 2dependence caused by the relativistic time dilation effect in the interacting particle system, where denotes the relativistic energy factor =( 2) /.",0
"Consider a field space of length Lalong the longitudinal (z-) direction and particles of rest mass m0, charge q0, longitudinal velocity vq, and gyration velocity v , within the transverse x yplane under the Lorenz force, q0v B0, and the RF field of TE mode, E= E0exp(i RFt)where idenotes the imaginary number.",0
"In the presence of RF field, particles with random gyration phases undergo emission of thermal radiation and the stimulated absorption of the RF power, resulting in their phase bunching.",0
These features raise the possibility of beam particle cooling when there is a stable energy state in the particle system.,0
"The allowed deviation in the conservation of wave number (momentum) vectors is of the order of /Lresulting in the finite-length-limited linewidth Lof the emission curve of radiation particles []: L=2 ( q/ RF) t, t L qc.",0
"Here t, RFc, qcand cdenote the transit time of particles, the phase velocity of the RF wave, the longitudinal speed and the gyration speed, respectively.",0
"There are other mechanisms of broadening (e.g., beam particle collisions, particle energy spread) that increase the emission linewidth beyond this fundamental limit [].",0
"The considerable part of broadening, however, comes from the enhanced damping of gyration energy caused by the collective effect in the phase bunched particles.",0
"The two processes do not cancel with each other exactly due to nonlinear particle gyration with the Lorentz-covariant cyclotron frequency, c =eB0 m0, where cis the cyclotron frequency.",0
"The nonlinear term gives stimulated absorption for 0> , i.e., < c/ RF, where the particles absorb the RF power to increase their energy so as to yield the resonance = c/ RF.",0
A semi-quantitative calculation on this process leads to extremely rapid phase bunching and energy cooling shorter than the transit time of particles in the RF field.,0
Some experimental results which provide inspiring indications of CMC are described in the following sections together with theoretical investigations of the simultaneous processes of phase bunching and energy cooling of gyrating particles. .,0
"As such, experimental tests using low energy electrons will provide indications of CMC, and hence one may deduce the features of CMC applied to high energy electron and ion beams.",0
This serves to transform adiabatically any desired fraction of the total kinetic energy into transverse kinetic energy with respect to the solenoid axis.,0
Computer calculations of magnetic field distribution and electron trajectories verified that this way of generating a helical motion worked up to the maximum beam energy but resulted in a very broad spectrum associated with the longitudinal momentum.,0
The resulting two response functions in Eq. have to be taken into account for analyzing the present experimental data based on electrons with extremely low longitudinal drift energy of less than eV or q=.,0
"This consideration is unnecessary in the cases of high energy particles, since they are resonant with only one of the forwardor backward-travelling waves.",0
In the present experiment it is essential to reduce the drift energy of the electrons to observe the CMC effect in the transverse energy.,0
It is because the low drift energy excludes strictly the possibility of the transfer of the longitudinal energy to the transverse energy being consistent with the assumption of the uniform RF field.,0
The difficulty of resolving the CMC effect due to the absorption of stray electrons is related to the present small scale experiment in which a low energy electron beam and a small drift velocity result in two overlapping response functions.,0
"Through the present experiments, only the resonance condition of coherent absorption mode, c max=( q/ RF) RF, was carefully investigated.",0
"Observation of Cooling In spite of the problems outlined in Section , we have obtained some inspiring indications of cooling of the transverse energy-time phase-space.",0
"In the experiments, the transverse kinetic energy was varied from below keV to beyond keV while the longitudinal drift energy was set at eV .",0
Thus it is possible to deduce the transverse kinetic energy distribution precisely by measuring the broadening of the Larmor radii of gyrating electrons depicted on the ZnS screen.,0
The longitudinal drift energy was adjusted to be in the range -300eV independent of the initial values of transverse kinetic energy.,0
"Because of this large spread of longitudinal drift energy, the electrons were expected to consist of two groups, i.e., c>L/ qcand c< L/ qc, depending on their drift velocity qc, where cis the cooling time.",0
corresponds to a transverse kinetic energy of keV and its radius is independent of the initial transverse kinetic energy.,0
"With a small longitudinal energy and the deduction of the energy spread ( )/ ( 0 0) T / T , the cooling time cis estimated to be c (L/ qc)/ln( T / T )< .23L/ qc 11ns with the action or the transit time of L/ qc ns.",0
The simultaneous appearance of broad inner band of circles and a sharp outer circle is due to the large spread of longitudinal drift energy.,0
Note that the broad circle and the sharp circle were separately observed in the second phase experiments by reducing the spread of longitudinal energy as shown in Fig.,0
"Once electrons gain their transverse kinetic energy through the stimulated absorption of RF energy, the gain of transverse kinetic energy is further intensified by the decrease of drift velocity qcdue to the recoil effect in the coherent absorption of backward travelling RF energy.",0
"On the contrary, for electrons with higher drift energy Tq>100eV , their transverse kinetic energy is almost unchanged in average due to their insufficient interaction with the RF field.",0
"However, this clear separation of heating and cooling groups was revealed in an abrupt appearance of the sharp circle unaccompanied by the heating circle observed in the second phase experiment.",0
Observation of Phase Bunching The principle of CMC so far discussed is based on the mechanism of bunching of phases of gyrating particles with respect to the applied RF field caused by the relativistic effects.,0
"In the experiments, however, the indication of phase bunching was obtained only indirectly through the drastic energy gain associated with the outer circles in Fig. .",0
"In fact, there has been no way of explaining the energy gain and the sharpness of the outer circles without assuming that the electrons are in resonance at a defined phase with the RF field.",0
The indication of phase bunching in CMC was seen in another experiment where the sharp outer circle was not necessarily concentric with the broad band of inner circles.,0
The second phase experiments were carried out with an improved Model apparatus made at Uppsala University and is shown in Fig.,0
"This served to adiabatically transform any desired fraction, for example % of the total kinetic energy into the gyration energy in the range of keV .",0
"After their passing through the fringing field, a helical electron beam with a Larmor radius of about mm ran through a longitudinal energy selector that consists of comb/grid slits aligned along the solenoid axis.",0
Another DC-biased cylindrical electrode was installed as a diagnostic tool to measure the longitudinal drift energy and also as an electron shutter to remove slow drift electrons by using negative bias voltages.,0
It was possible to generate an electron beam typically of about A with a longitudinal energy of eV with a resolution of about %.,0
"The electrons passed through the -mm-long cavity with a longitudinal energy of eV only once, which limited the action time to t=67ns.",0
Their gyration with an energy of T =22keV was resonant with the backward propagating RF wave and initially had a uniform phase distribution.,0
Special attention was paid to investigate the dependence of dynamics of gyrations on the RF power in order to confirm the sharp pattern suggesting CMC which was observed in the first phase experiments.,0
This implies that the energy heating was caused by change in the distribution of the gyration phase as will be explained in Section .,0
The sharp ring was not accompanied by any additional ring accumulating all electrons at the same energy when the longitudinal energy resolution was better than %.,0
This clear abruptness of pattern change became more marked with the increase of longitudinal energy resolution up to % which influenced the precision of critical RF field E0through the resolution of action time t=L/ qc.,0
The separation of the rings depended sensitively on the extent of excess power and was independent of the initial gyration energy.,0
"Through the recoil effect of RF photons, a longitudinal energy shift of eV was caused by the initial gyration energy difference of keV , which disturbed the observation of the phase bunched pattern (but it would be practically insignificant at high longitudinal energies).",0
The phase transition that we observed in the CMC experiments indicates the significance of critical action of the stimulating radiation field.,0
"When a gyrating charged particle is injected into this cavity, the particle will amplify the thermal radiation in the cavity if its gyration frequency c/ is close to RF[].",0
"Suppose that a cavity of volume V0is tuned in the T E01mode with the quality factor Q. In this case the radiation power emitted by one particle P1, the stored energy in the cavity W, and the cavity loss PLare, respectively P1=q0r RFEs, W= 2 0V0E2 s, and PL= RFW Q, where 0is the dielectric constant, Esis the field strength in the cavity driven by one particle, and the Larmor radius ris assumed to be much smaller than the cavity cross-section.",0
"As many particles are injected, considerable number NBof particles will be bunched in their gyration phase because of the collective gyration effect mentioned in Section .",0
The damping time 0specifies the characteristics of the system of relativistic gyrating particles in the resonating cavity [].,0
"In these fields, all gyration particles are subject to stimulated emission of radiation and stimulated absorption of RF power resulting in the damping of their gyrating energy, which is specified by the characteristic damping time 0of the system.",0
"besides the Lorentz force q0v B0caused by the solenoidal field, and the driving electric force q0Eof the RF field, where p denotes the transverse momentum of gyration.",0
"=q0E0 m0cei , which is equivalent to the coupled equations [], d( ) dt+ 2 0 =Kcos , K q0E0 m0c, andd dt= K sin provided q0B0 m0 RF.",0
"In the right hand side of Eq., the first term is a particular solution that has no arbitrary constant and represents a forced gyration driven by the RF field.",0
"[, ] under a given RF field action one or two stable states exist and gyrating particles would be cooled towards these states.",0
Cooling Dynamics Phase Bunching It is indispensable to solve the coupled equations Eqs.for investigating the cooling dynamics.,0
"In the case of the present experiments, the correlation factor abecomes a2 c 0 ( ), which is identical to the correlation factor or the phase bunching factor introduced in previous CMC papers [-].",0
"If one takes into account the drastic change of frequency mismatch , Eq. can be solved analytically leading to an asymptotic equation of phase bunching [].",0
The first phase experiments show that the phase bunching in CMC is in resonance ( = ) at a defined phase ( d /dt=) with the RF field.,0
"For gyrating particles around the CMC state, the rate of momentum change is obtained using Eqs., and under the condition .",0
Cooling Time Sections and noted that the RF field breeds the forced gyration of particles over the time 0through stimulated absorption of the RF power.,0
This field stimulates absorption of the RF power yielding the coherent forced gyration of particles as seen in the particular solution terms of Eqs.,0
We have dealt with the dynamics of damping and cooling during a long time on the contrary to the cases where the final energy of particles is t= tinstead of t .,0
"The phases are very quickly bunched, but they are incomplete and associated with heating, as described approximately in the scheme of Liouville s theorem.",0
"Under the present experimental conditions, the number of gyration times is not necessarily equal to all electrons due to the separation between the RF cavity exit and the phosphor plate and to the longitudinal velocity spread.",0
with the value ERF kV/m of the T E01waveguide mode which is equivalent to the field ERF 21kV/m of the T E011cavity mode corresponding to the critical RF power of W.,0
"The transit time of electrons is about ns, indicating the agreement between the experimental results and the present arguments.",0
The phase bunching was not directly observed in the experiments due to uncertainty of gyration times during the transit between the exit of RF cavity and the phosphor screen.,0
"The most remarkable one is the abrupt appearance of a sharp ring CMC pattern observed in the second phase experiments, which differs clearly from the abruptness in the frequency dependence of nonlinear resonance [].",0
We have seen that a system of gyrating particles in the RF cavity is specified by the characteristic damping time 0and the incoherent field ENBgenerated by the particles.,0
"This implies that whenever an RF field ERFis driven by an external oscillator, the gyrating particle system undergoes cooling towards a coherent radiative system with a cooling time c=ENB 0/ERF.",0
"Hence if the action time of the field is sufficiently long compared to c, the cooling will be fully developed, resulting in a radiative system of particles in the same phase and stable energy state.",0
"In the present experiments, the action time is determined by the transit time tof electrons gyrating in the RF cavity and thus the extent of cooling will be dependent upon the factor exp( t/ c)= exp( ERF t/ENB 0)without any discontinuous change in the state of electrons contradicting to the observation results.",0
"The volume of energy-time phase space is identical to that of momentumspace phase space for free or quasi-free particles [], so the former is estimated in the scheme of CMC theory described in Section .",0
"For the practical cases ( ) < ( ) t, the numerical value of Eq. is smaller than the Planck constant the uncertainty point of the phase space, where the electrons originate to reveal wave characteristics.",0
"In such a coherent particle beam, all free or quasi-free particles are in the same phase and energy state and it becomes the state of entire macroscopic particle beam.",0
"The beam can behave in a completely ordered way, in which the action of any particle is correlated with the action of all the others yielding the remarkable collective features on its dynamics.",0
"Conclusion The author raised a prime principle of the cooling of charged particle beams in this chapter, thereby developing a new theory of this cooling mechanism by taking a semi-classical dynamical approach.",0
It was found that both the phase bunching and the energy cooling of gyrating particles are caused simultaneously under certain conditions of the stimulating RF field through the relativistic gyration effects.,0
"The experimental results were in agreement with this new theory, thereby supporting the new cooling scheme of CMC as the phase transition from an incoherent system to a coherent radiative system.",0
RFemits radiation while the particle with the low energy < c/ RF absorbs the radiation through the simulation of the RF field resulting in the cooling of gyrating particles.,0

Abstract This paper investigates the influence of elastic deformation on the velocity of body waves in compressible isotropic materials making use of the framework of acoustoelasticity.,0
"Specifically , it examines body waves propagating at an angle to the principal deformation axes, where both shear and normal deformations are present in the coordinate system defined by the wave propagation direction.",0
"While numerous efforts have addressed this topic , the theoretical derivations have not yet to provide definitive concl usions about the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains .",0
"To derive more specific conclusions for body waves in concrete, we analyzed three examples using concrete as the medium.",0
"The key findings are that, in case of concrete materials when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, variations in longitudinal wave velocity are predominantly attributed to changes in normal strains, whereas transverse wave velocity is sign ificantly influenced by both normal and shear strains.",0
"In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers established the fundamental framework of acoustoelastic theory by incorporating the nonlinear terms into the constitutive equations of elastic materials [, -].",0
"However, the current expressions derived from the acoustoelastic framework is limited to cases where the wave propagation direction is either parallel or perpendicular to one of the principal axes of deformation.",0
"This constraint limits the widening of application scenarios for acoustoelasticity in engineering practice outside laboratory, in which, researchers can design test setups allowing the a lignment of the sensor layout with the wave propagation direction.",0
"However, in these applications, there is no assurance that elastic waves will consistently propagate along these predetermined directions.",0
"In such an instance, it becomes impractical to consistently align the wave propagation direction along the principal deformation directions.",0
"When there is an angle between the body wave propagation direction and the principal stress direction , by establishing a new coordinate system aligned parallel and perpendicular to the wave propagation direction and computing the stress matrix within this new coordinate system, shear stresses can be identified.",0
"Nevertheless, the complexity of the ir expressions may pose difficulties for engineers when applying them to practical engineering scenarios , and no specific conclusion regarding the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains can be drawn from the theoretical derivations .",0
This paper aims to investigate the influence of elastic deformations on body -wave velocity in compressible isotropic solids and further simplifie s its application in detecting stress and strain changes.,0
Three numerical examples using concrete as the medium are presented in Section to explore the influence of normal and shear strains on body -wave velocity.,0
Brief introduction on the development of acoustoelastic theor y Linear elasticity -based acoustoelastic theory The theory of acoustoelasticity elucidates the relationship between applied stress and elastic wave velocity within the framework of continuum mechanics .,0
"During this development, the connection between wave velocity and stress is established in the realm of linear elasticity.",0
"However, compared to the much smaller strain due to wave motion, the initial static strain is significantly larger and cannot be considered to be infinitesimal in the constitutive equation.",0
"However, his main conclusion , as shown on page of his paper, still falls within the realm of linear elasticity , where he states : on peut montrer que ces termes ne modifient pas la vitesse de propagation tant qu'il s agit d ondes de tr s petites amplitudes (it can be shown that these terms [third order elastic constants] do not modify the propagation speed as long as the waves have very small amplitudes ).",0
"Assuming energy conservation, Murnaghan demonstrates the necessity of six constants to describe strain energy in compressible, isotropic materials: one representing initial hydrostatic pressure, two second -order elastic constants (Lam constants), and three third -order elastic constants denoted as l, m, and n, commonly known as Murnaghan constants .",0
"Subsequently , many researchers contributed to the field of nonlinear elasticity by proposing general form s of the strain -energy function without identifying th ird-order elastic constants .",0
"Since the strain -energy function is not specified, the theory is applicable to both compressible and incompressible materials.",0
"[] further discuss ed the restriction on the strain -energy function to ensur e its valid ity for a material capable of sustain ing a state of pure, homogeneous deformation.",0
"In , Hughes and Kelly [] incorporat ed Murnaghan constants into the constitutive equation and derived the explicit expressions for acoustoelasticity in compressible isotropic materials .",0
"Equation of motion The equation of motion for acoustoelasticity is given as []: incremental incremental ,ki ijkl jluuBx x t = where 0 are the mass densit y in the natural state without load applied , and uiincremental denotes the displacements of dynamic disturbance .",0
"Ca a a a = + + + + + + where emn indicates the static strain tensor caused by the external load , and uiinitial denotes the displacements associated with the static deformation induced by the external load.",0
"The Cijkl in Equation represents the second -order elastic coefficients composed of the second -order elastic constants, also known as Lam parameters, and .",0
"tuU = where N is a unit vector normal to the plane wave that relates to the wave propagation direction, k represents the wavenumber, is the angular frequency, and U is the amplitude vector indicates the wave polarization direction.",0
"When they are orthogonal, indicating that the polarization direction is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, these waves are identified as transverse waves or shear waves.",0
"Conversely, when the vectors are parallel, si gnifying that the polarization direction aligns with the wave propagation direction, these waves are termed longitudinal waves or compression waves.",0
"The choice of a harmonic wave is made to simplify the derivation process, but the outcome is also applicable to plane waves with a general time function [].",0
"Substituting Equation into Equation gives : ()(),ijkl j l ik kB N N v U = where v, coinciding with /k, denotes the wave velocity.",0
"This vector, which points in the propagation direction, is easier to determine in a measurement than the wave polarization related amplitude vector.",0
"Therefore, we adopt this configuration and propose a governing equation based on Equation with a specified vector N , N=(;;), while leaving the amplitude vector Uk unspecified.",0
"Please note that in the following sections, we differentiate between strain tensor and principal strains using the following notation: the strain tensor, including normal and she ar strains, is represented using eij, while the principal strain is denoted as ei.",0
"Additionally, normal and shear strains in Equation can be obtained from principal strains by applying a coordinate transform ation.",0
This transformation is based on fixing the propagation direction along the x-axis in the new coordinate system and transforming the strain matrix accordingly .,0
"This approach results in the acoustoelastic moduli tensor, or instantaneous elastic moduli A0ijkl, being related to the principal strains, assuming that elastic constants remain unchange d during the loading process .",0
"Determining the wave velocity necessitates both the eigenvalue and eigenvector: the eigenvector identifies the wave mode, while the eigenvalue provides the velocity of this mode .",0
"In the acoustoelastic modulus matrix, the diagonal elements pert ain to terms associated with normal strains, while shear strains are hidden within the off-diagonal elements, as depicted in Equation .",0
"In the remainder of this paper, the acoustoelastic modulus matrix before and after the coordinate rotation will be referred to as the B0-matrix and B-matrix, respectively.",0
"Numerical examples Based on this governing equation, the influence of body waves velocity due to both normal and shear strains in a medium will be investigated through three practical examples.",0
"When body waves propagate inclined to the principal stress directions in an elastic medium, as discussed previously, we can identify the existence of shear strains in the plane along and/or perpendicular to the wave propagation direction.",0
"Example examines situations where body waves travel perpendicular to the shear deformation pl ane, commonly known as acoustoelastic birefringence.",0
"Example involves body waves traveling on the shear deformation plane, posing challenges in deriving analytical forms of acoustoelasticity.",0
"C onsequently, numerical calculations will be employed to evaluate the effects of shear strain on body wave acoustoelasticity in this scenario.",0
"Example : waves propagating parallel or perpendicular to the principal deformations existing acoustoelastic expressions in the literature Assuming that three principal stresses are applied along x-, yand z-axes, respectively [, -, ] .",0
"Considering that the propagation direction is (;;), the eigenvalue ( B1111/ 0)/ corresponds to the velocity of the longitudinal wave, while the ( B2121/ 0)/ and (B3131/ 0)/ correspond to the velocities of transverse waves with polarization direction being yand z-axes.",0
"In the absence of externally induced strain in the isotropic medium, the expression of wave velocities is reduced to [( +2 )/ 0]/ and ( / 0)/, representing the classic solution of longitudinal and transverse wave velocities, respectively.",0
The second example addresses a scenario where the body wave travels perpendicular to the shear deformation plane in an isotropic material.,0

"Given that the eigenvectors specif ied in Equation denote the principal strain directions, strikingly, it becomes clear that in this scenario, the polarization d irections of body waves will always align with the principal strain directions because of the acoustoelastic effect.",0
"In addition, as shown in Equation , the eigenvalues of the B-matrix are solely determined by the B0-matrix, which is calculated based on the principal strain.",0
"This implies that in this given configuration, if the magnitudes and directions of the principal strains and the material elastic constants remain constant, the wave velocity, whether it is for th e longitudinal or transverse wave, will remain constant regardless of the rotation of the coordinate system or the magnitude of the shear strain.",0
"This equation reveals that the difference between the squared velocities of two transverse waves is proportional to the difference in principal strain, which is commonly referred to as the acoustoelastic bire fringence [, -].",0
"From this specific instance, one might notice that the influence of shear strains on the transverse wave velocity cannot be ignored.",0
"Firstly, as the coordinate system rotates, the normal strain undergoes alterations while the transverse wave velocity remains constant.",0
"If the transverse wave velocities are exclusively dependent on the normal strains, their values cannot be constant during the rotation.",0
"If the effect of shear strains is minimal, the moduli B2131 and B3121 in Equation can be disregarded, resulting in a diagonalized Bmatrix.",0
"Consequently, the eigenvectors in this matrix, which are (;;), (;;) and (;;), consistently align with the new coordinate system's axes after rotation.",0
Example : waves propagating on the shear deformation plane Example presents a scenario where the body wave travels perpendicular to the shear deformation plane within an isotropic material.,0

"Additionally, it can be seen from Figure that the minimum exact transverse wave velocity does not occur along the principal directions.",0
"[], who also observed that the highest or lowest wave velocity does not always appear in the principal directions in metals and polymers .",0
"Therefore, it can be inferr ed that the longitudinal wave velocity change can be accurately estimated using the first diagonal element B1111 in the B-matrix, where only normal strains are considered.",0
"In contrast, the transverse wave velocity cannot be estimated using the diagonal element B2121, confirming our earlier observation from Figure , which further suggests that shear strains have a significant effect on transverse wave velocities.",0
"Velocity changes of the quasi -longitudinal wave based on the first diagonal element B1111, the quasi -longitudinal wave based on the first eigenvalue B1, the quasi -transverse wave based on the second diagonal element B2121 and quasi -transverse wave based on the second eigenvalue B2 using Equation with respect to the rotation angle . .",0
"Discussion We proved in this article that in the stress/strain configuration shown in Example , the shear deformation does not have a substantial effect on the longitudinal wave velocity but can significantly change the transverse wave velocity in the context of concrete.",0
"In other words, the longitudinal wave velocity depends mainly on the normal stress/strain, while the transverse wave velocity de pends on both normal and shear stress/strain.",0
"The conclusion regarding longitudinal waves suggests that the acoustoelasti c effect of these waves is predominantly associated with elongations or contractions per unit length along the propagation direction, making its function comparable to that of strain gauge s.",0
This principle can also be applied to the longitudinal wave -based acoustoel astic effect to determine the magnitudes and directions of the prin cipal strains in a plane stress state.,0
"While this treatment of concrete as an isotropic material resembles the concept of effective medium , wherein a disordered medium is perceived as a homogeneous effective medium by the probing wave [], its validity is restricted to coherent waves.",0
Coherent waves are those whose energy predominantly propagates in the initial direction and undergoes limited scattering events [].,0
"Therefore, incorporating multiply scattered waves into the current acoustoelastic framework holds promise for enhancing the applicability of this theory in monitoring stress in concrete structures.",0
"We noted some inconsistent results in the existing literature on acoustoelastic theory , which could lead to inaccurate descriptions of the acoustoelastic effect and misinterpretations of experimental results.",0
Conclusion This paper investigates variations in body wave velocities within a compressible isotropic material subjected to shear and normal deformations.,0
"The wave mode and corresponding velocity are determined by solving an eigenvalue problem, where shear strains ar e embedded in the non diagonal elements of the acoustoelastic moduli matrix.",0
"First, we reproduce the acoustoelasticity expressions for body waves propagating either parallel or perpendicular to the principal axes of deformation, as demonstrated in Example .",0
"To explore the impact of shear deformation -related terms on wave velocities, we then examine two additional specific examples.",0
"In Example , where waves propagate perpendicular to the shear deformation plane, we reaffirm the notion of acoustoelastic birefringence, where wave velocities are solely determined by the magnitude of principal strains.",0
"This observation highlights the sig nificance of shear strain in influencing the velocities and polarizations of transverse waves, which cannot be disregarded.",0
"Moving on to Example , where waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, we find that the longitudinal wave velocity is primarily influenced by the magnitude of normal strains, with negligible impacts from the shear strains.",0
"Conversely, the transverse wave velocity experiences a significant influence from the shear strains, indicating a strong dependency on both normal and shear strains in concrete.",0
"Based on these examples, we draw a general conclusion regarding the influence of shear strains on body wave velocities in concrete: shear strains exert a limited effect on longitudinal wave velocities but significantly alters transverse wave velocities in the context of concrete when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane.",0

"In this work, we seek characterizations of global hyperbolicity in smooth Lorentzian manifolds that do not rely on the manifold topology and that are inspired by metric geometry.",0
"In particular, strong causality is not assumed, so part of the problem is precisely that of recovering the manifold topology so as to make sense of it also in rough frameworks.",0
The first is based solely on chronological diamonds and is interesting due to its analogies with the Hopf-Rinow theorem.,0
"Introduction The condition of global hyperbolicity is the most important in mathematical relativity, as it allows us to regard the evolution of spacetime as a well-defined PDE problem, with initial conditions imposed on a Cauchy hypersurface.",0
"It is expected, particularly for unification with the quantum world, that at the most fundamental level spacetime is not described by a smooth manifold, as quantum mechanics usually introduces elements of discreteness.",0
"While we cannot be sure which mathematical structure will prove to be the correct one to replace the successful smooth Lorentzian manifold of general relativity, it seems reasonable to look for a formulation of global hyperbolicity that does not use the manifold topology.",0
"In a sense, the manifold topology should be recovered and hence justified among the many available possibilities, e.g. the discussion in [, , ].",0
"In this endeavor, we shall take inspiration from metric geometry [], thus following the recent trend in Lorentzian metric/length spaces [, , , , , , , , , , , ], rather than order/domain theory.",0
"For instance, it has been shown [, ] that under K-causality (which is equivalent to stable causality) the manifold topology can be recovered from the K(or Seifert) relation in a completely order theoretic manner using ideas from domain theory.",0
"Note that in these studies topology is derived from the notion of order, while in metric inspired theories topology is deduced from a two-point function.",0
"Ultimately, we prove that globally hyperbolic spacetimes and their topologies are characterized as follows1(this is the same as Thms. , but with all properties spelled out) Theorem .",0
"The difficulties are related to the absence of any a priori relative strength between Lorentzian metric space topology (i.e. the topology T, which is actually known to be unique and coincident with the initial topology of the functions dp,dp,p M) and the manifold topology: neither is a priori included in the other.",0
"For instance, we expect that discontinuities of din the manifold topology increase the family of T-open sets with respect to the manifold topology, while causal pathologies such as violation of strong causality decrease their number.",0
"Extreme care must be exerted in proofs, as continuous curves in one topology might not be continuous in the other, the time functions in the smooth spacetime sense might not coincide with the time functions in the Lorentzian metric space sense, causal curves in the smooth spacetime sense might not coincide with isocausal curves in the Lorentzian metric space sense, and so on.",0
"Still, the fact that for both topologies a limit curve theorem holds, though relative to different type of curves and topologies, signals that they could be related and actually coincide.",0
This fact makes them suitable for an abstract definition of Lorentzian metric space which includes causal sets [] as they are naturally endowed with the discrete topology.,0
"If such pointwise conditions were included, the topology Twould coincide with the Alexandrov topology [, Thm. ] and the proof would be considerably simplified.",0
"In subsection we single out a formulation independent of topology, and dependent on properties of the family of chronological diamonds, which is interesting for analogies with the Heine-Borel property in positive signature.",0
"Ultimately, we prove the above main theorem, and in the following sections we demonstrate how the characterisations we suggest work in less regular or Finslerian cases.",0
"Subsequently, the result is generalized to the Lorentz-Finsler case by passing through the proof of a Lorentz-Finsler Busemann-Mayer type formula (and another useful formula).",0
"Finally, in (c) the use of topology is evident as the topology on the space of curves is induced from that on the manifold.",0
"Here use of the manifold topology is made in the time/temporal functions used which, by definition, must be continuous in the manifold topology.",0
A manifold-topology-independent characterization Having established that none of the available characterizations of global hyperbolicity is independent of the manifold topology one might suspect that it should be difficult to find one.,0
"A spacetime (M, g)is globally hyperbolic iff the topology generated by the chronological diamonds is Hausdorff and any chronological diamond is relatively compact in that topology.",0
"We recall that a chronological diamond is a set of the form I(p, q) :=I+(p) I (q) where Iis the chronological relation (which is known to be open in the manifold topology).",0
"This means that the family of chronological diamonds, regarded as a subbasis for a topology, is actually a basis for such topology.",0
"In the original formulation, the closure was taken with respect to the manifold topology, which we have just shown to coincide with the Alexandrov topology.",0
"This definition is highly robust when it comes to weakening the regularity conditions of the spacetime, precisely because it depends only on the topology and order.",0
"It does not require a predefined topology, and the relation used is the open chronological one, not the closed causal one.",0
"Clearly, Theorem suggests using this characterization to define global hyperbolicity for sets endowed with a strict partial order (irreflexive, transitive, asymmetric) I, a mathematical setting quite distinct from that of closed ordered spaces.",0
"We now wish to emphasize the formal analogy between the characterization in and the Hopf-Rinow theorem in Riemannian geometry [, Thm.",0
"Similarly, of little importance is the fact that it is equivalent, by the same Hopf-Rinow theorem, to the completeness of the metric space ( M, d), where dis the metric.",0
"There is a clear parallelism between Theorem and this theorem, with the following replacements Spacetime Riemannian space Globally hyperbolic spacetime Complete Riemannian space Chronological diamond Ball Alexandrov topology Metric topology The main difference is the absence of the requirement for the Hausdorff property in the positive signature result.",0
"However, the triangle inequality ensures, as it does in the Lorentzian signature, that the balls generate the same topology whether considered as a basis or subbasis.",0
Theorem thus supports the idea that globally hyperbolic spacetimes are analogous to complete Riemannian spaces in the Lorentzian signature.,0
"This correspondence can be extended further, with characterization (e) serving as an analog of the Hopf-Rinow theorem, as envisioned by Burtscher and Garc aHeveling.",0
Perhaps Theorem clarifies more than other results that the analog of balls in the Lorentzian signature are the chronological diamonds .,0
"However, only when this compactness condition is expressed in terms of chronological diamonds can we dispense with the manifold topology and establish a compelling correspondence between the two signatures.",0
"In statements concerning continuity of the functions d, dp, dp, p M, it is understood that such property is with respect to the manifold topology of M unless stated otherwise.",0
"p I (p)d(p , q) easily implies that dp, dp, p Mare upper semicontinuous and hence continuous in the Alexandrov topology.",0
"The functions d,dpanddp,p M, are lower semicontinuous for the Alexandrov topology and hence any finer topology (e.g. the manifold topology).",0
"Conversely, if the functions dpanddp,p M, are lower semi-continuous for a topology then that topology contains the Alexandrov topology.",0
"In other words, the lower semi-continuity property is equivalent to the property that the topology contains the Alexandrov topology.",0
"If the Lorentzian distance disT T-continuous then the functions dp:=d(p, )anddp:=d( , p)areT-continuous for every p M. The converse holds if Tis a topology such that p I+(p) I (p)for every p M, e.g. the manifold topology or the Alexandrov topology.",0
"+ , which proves the upper semi-continuity of dwith respect to T T. In the next result the topology involved is the manifold topology.",0
"The key point is that by using only the Lorentzian distance function, we have been able to derive properties as robust as strong causality, as demonstrated in Theorem .",0
LetAbe a family of open subsets for a topology such that (a)Aseparates points and (b) every point admits an open neighborhood in A contained in a compact set.,0
This leads to the following result which is interesting as it characterizes global hyperbolicity using only properties of the Lorentzian distance functions and without invoking the manifold topology.,0
"g)be a spacetime which is weakly d-distinguishing, such that the chronological diamonds are relatively compact in a topology Tthat makes the functions {dp, dp, p M}lower semi-continuous, and such that at least one of the following conditions hold (a)d-reflectivity, (b) the functions {dp, dp, p M}are actually T-continuous and p I+(p) I (p)for every p M, where closure is in the topology T, (c) strong causality.",0
"Then the topology T, the Alexandrov topology, the manifold topology and the initial topology of the family {dp, dp, p M}are all coincident.",0
"We recall that in a topology Tthat makes the functions {dp, dp, p M} lower semi-continuous is equivalent to in a topology Tfiner than the Alexandrov topology by Prop. .",0
"If we assume d-reflectivity (option (a)) then, from Thm. , the spacetime is causally continuous hence strongly causal which implies that the Alexandrov topology is Hausdorff [, Thm. ] and hence Aseparates points.",0
"Note that the manifold topology is finer than the initial topology of the family {dp, dp, p M}which is finer than the Alexandrov topology.",0
"Since the first and third (last) topology coincide, we conclude that the manifold topology coincides with the initial topology of the family {dp, dp, p M}.",0
"By using the manifold topology Theorem gives the following corollary, as the continuity of dimplies d-reflectivity and the continuity of the functions {dp, dp, p M}.",0
"Then the Alexandrov topology, the manifold topology and the initial topology of the family {dp, dp, p M}are all coincident.",0
"x y z(the chronology relation being I={d >}), (X, d) is weakly d-distinguishing3, every point is contained in some chronological diamond, and every chronological diamond is relatively compact in some topology Tthat makes the function dcontinuous.",0
"In particular, the topology Tis unique and coincides with the initial topology of the functions {dp, dp, p M}, and so is referred as the topology of the Lorentzian metric space .",0
"In a sense, the real problem is that of justifying and recovering the manifold topology out of ingredients that do not use it.",0
"Suppose that (X, d)is a Lorentzian metric space in the sense of Def. which satisfies (a), (b) or (c) of Thm. , then (M, g)is globally hyperbolic and the Lorentzian metric space topology coincides with the manifold topology.",0
"These are examples of Lorentzian metric spaces for which the natural (Lorentzian metric space) topology is the discrete one, so the property p I (p) does not hold.",0
"Moreover, in this case the Lorentzian metric space causal order coincides with Jand the Lorentzian metric space topology Tcoincides with the manifold topology.",0

"Since for each tthe sequence xkis contained (for sufficiently large k) in J ( (t)), which is closed in Lorentzian metric space topology, the point xbelongs to t> J ( (t)).",0
"I(x, xk), thus k D(x, xk) = J(x, xk) which are compact in the Lorentzian metric space topology and satisfy the finite intersection property.",0
"Note that k J(x, xk) ={x} because if y J (xk) for every k, then, ( y, x) by the closure of Jin the Lorentzian metric space topology.",0
"For every neighborhood (in the Lorentzian metric space topology) O x there is a sufficiently large ksuch that J(x, xk) O.",0
We conclude that the spacetime is globally hyperbolic and the Lorentzian metric space topology coincides with the manifold topology.,0

"Now, I+(c) ( J+(b))C= where the two sets are open sets in the Lorentzian metric space topology (and the former also in the manifold topology).",0
But any manifold topology open neighborhood of q intersects I+(q) =I+(x) I+(c) the Lorentzian metric space topology open neighborhood of x.,0

"More speci cally, terms typable i n qualitative systems such as the simply-typed -calculus can be compositionally embedded into the calculus.",0
"The calculus thus obtained can be seen as an extension of Boudol s resource -calculus [], and we call it the structural resource -calculus .",0
"At the level of terms, there is both the possibility of having a nonlinear use of variables, but a lso of passing a bag of terms to an abstraction, in the style of the resource -calculus.",0
An intersection type assignment system is an integra l part of the calculus and guarantees the termination of each sequence of -reduction steps.,0
"In addition to the de nition of the structural resource calculus, the key technical contributions of this paper are proofs of con uence and strong normalization for structura l reduction.",0
"The purpose of this section is to informally describe the process of linearization in the -calculus, anticipating some of the problems we have to face, at the same time introducing the non-specialist reader to the topic.",0
"One possible solution would be to extend the uni cation algorithm for simple types to the intersection type setting, which is precisely what has been done in [].",0
"Given sequences of lists =/vector a1,...,/vector a nand =/vectorb1,...,/vectorbn we de ne their tensor product as pointwise list concatenation: =/vector a1 /vectorb1,...,/vector a n /vectorbn.",0
"T YPES AND MORPHISMS Intersection types are often de ned equationally : the intersection type costructor a bis given as a monoidal product satisfying some equations: associativity, commutativity and possibly idempotency.",0
"In this paper, we take a more re ned viewpoint: the intersection connective is still a strictly associative tensor product, but we replace equations by concrete operations on types.",0
"Operations on intersection types become then structural operations on lists, seen as a categorical tensor product (see Section III ).",0
"We de ne the set of resource types (RT) and the set of intersection types (!(RT)) by the following inductive grammar: RT a,b::=o|/vector a a !(RT) /vector a::=/an}bracketle{ta1,...,a k/an}bracketri}ht(k N) We de ne a notion of morphism of resource types by induction in Figure 1b, parametrically on {l,c}.Morphisms of resource types can be seen as proof-relevant subtyping .",0
"V. R ESOURCE TERMS We now introduce the structural resource -calculus , which can be thought of as a non-uniform counterpart to the standard simply-typed -calculus in which the structural operations are kept explicit .",0
"The calculus is built in such a way as to separate the structural (and in particular exponential , in the sense of linear logic) side of -reduction from the actual substitution operation, which remains linear.",0
The tensor product of contexts consists of the pairwise concate nation of intersection types assigned to the same variable.,0
"The main novelty of the structural resource calculus is the typing of abstractions: whenever we bound variables, we are allowed to decorate them with morphisms of intersection types.",0
"The notion of -long term we consider relies on full application: an application s/vectort1 /vectortnshould be of atomic type o, both when sis a variable and when sis a function.",0
"However, by performing the leftmost linear reduction to its normal form, we obtain the t erm t= z .z/an}bracketle{tz/an}bracketri}ht, since the substitution forces the permutation of the two occurrences of z. Nowtis not an exponential normal form anymore.",0
Qualitative Fragment and Uniformity: We can de ne a fragment of the structural resource calculus into which we shall embed every strongly normalizing -term.,0
"From the former theorem and strong normalization of structural reduction (Theorem ), we obtain strong normalizatio n of simply-typed terms as a corollary.",0
"n:/vector an s:b fi:/vectorbi /vector ai xf1 :/vectorb1,...,xfnn:/vectorbn subs:a we can characterize both forms of semantics by exploiting ou r calculus.",0
"We can then rephrase Ehrhard s result into our setting, obtaining an operational and proof-relevant vers ion of the collapse, bridging categorical constructions and ou r rewriting system.",0
"[], [] consider a weakly linear fragment of the -calculus and a transformation of all terms of the ordinary -calculus into this fragment which preserves normal forms; the transformation, however, does not occur internally to the calculus, being based on Levy s lega l paths.",0
"They present a uni cation algorithm that, given a simply typed -termM, produces a typing for Min a restricted (uniform) non-idempotentintersection type system.",0
"Our structural resource -calculus can be seen as a further re nement of that framework, where nested structural rules are allowed.",0
"While we presented our results without relying on abstract constructions, our work has been strongly in uenced by the -dimensional categorical semantics of the -calculus.",0
"We have shown how to embed qualitative type systems into our calculus and how to recover a classic result in the denotational semantics of linear logic, namely the extensional collapse .",0
We believe that the structural resource -calculus can be suitably extended to encode other qualitative systems of in terest.,0
"Since the normalization of linear reduction holds by a simple combinatorial argument, the proof of normalizatio n for those qualitative systems depends on the well-foundedn ess of exponential reduction, which we proved by a suitable reducibility argument.",0
We combined the PDX layout with recent dimensionpruning algorithms ADSampling [ ] and BSA [ ] that accelerate approximate vector search.,0
"We found that these algorithms on the horizontal vector layout can loseto SIMD-optimized linear scans, even if they are SIMD-optimized.",0
"Unlike previous pruning algorithms, it can work on vector data ""as-is"" without preprocessing; making it attractive for vector databases with frequent updates.",0
"PDX stores dimensions in a vertical layout, allowing efficient dimension-by-dimension distance calculation, more opportunities for SIMD execution, and better memory locality for search algorithms that prune dimensions.",0
"Therefore, it is no surprise that a flurry of improvements to approximate VSS have been developed in recent years, mainly focusing on improving existing index structures (better data access patterns [ ,], GPU optimizations [ ,], leveraging disk storage [ ,,], SIMD kernels [ ,]) and reducing the trade-off between losing information in the vectors (quantization) and achieving higher recalls [ ,,,].",0
"However, the current de-facto layout to store vectors (the vector-by-vector/horizontal/N-ary layout in Figure ) prevents these algorithms from always beating SIMDoptimized searches due to the latency to evaluate their pruning bounds.",0
"Furthermore, we introduce PDXearch , a search framework applicable in exact and approximate KNN that leverages the PDX layout by adaptively scanning dimensions as required by the underlying algorithm and query.",0
"Finally, we introduce PDX-BOND : A VSS algorithm in the same line of ADSampling and BSA that leverages PDX by first accessing the most relevant dimensions relative to an incoming query .",0
"The insight that the ADSampling [] and BSA [] dimension pruning algorithms, which were originally evaluated with scalar code, can be actually slower than SIMD-optimized searches.",0
"An experimental evaluation of our search framework on vector datasets and CPU architectures, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of PDX to achieve significant speedups both in exact and approximate settings (Section ).",0
The design and evaluation of PDX-BOND : A VSS algorithm that leverages the PDX layout to visit first the most relevant dimensions relative to the incoming query.,0
An open-source implementation of our algorithms in C++ with Python bindings for their ease of use (https://github. com/cwida/PDX).,0
Approximate indexes aim to build data structures that guide the search to the most suitable place of the D-dimensional space in which the query may find its nearest neighbours.,0
"On the other hand, IVF is a bucket-based index that applies a nonoptimized Lloyd algorithm (k-means) to the vector collection to group them into lists/buckets.",0
"In this study, we focus our experiments on exact search and bucketing indexes (IVF), as the PDX layout is a perfect fit for them.",0
"However, they are not the first algorithms to pursue dimensions pruning per vector, as previous studies tried to do so in an exact fashion by computing exact bounds on the distance metric.",0
"SIGMOD , June , , Berlin, Germany Leonardo Kuffo, Elena Krippner, and Peter Boncz Approximate pruning techniques try to prune vectors with a low probability of getting into the KNN candidates list of a query after having inspected a few of their dimensions.",0
This evaluation is done via hypothesis testing by comparing the partial distance with a threshold (the current best exact distance) using a fixed error bound ( 0).,0
ADSampling also introduced a data layout that separates the vectors into two blocks: One with the first dimensions (fully scanned first) and the other one with the rest of the dimensions (scanned only on the vectors not pruned with the first hypothesis testing).,0
"Furthermore, BSA introduces a framework in which the probability of a vector being part of the KNN candidates list is evaluated via error quantiles (given by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality [ ]) rather than hypothesis testing.",0
"Note that pruning power does not directly translate to speedup, as these algorithms perform additional work to evaluate bounds.",0
"Here, we visit dimensions one by one ( =), doing the hypothesis testing at each step to show the real potential of pruning.",0
"From these key observations, we detect where pruning algorithms are missing opportunities to optimize their search strategy.",0
"The hypothesis testing no longer brings benefits after a certain dimension (pruning no 1When referring to BSA, we would be referring to BSA the version of BSA without the learned instance approach (named BSA ), as the latter incurs a huge preprocessing cost and does not improve query latency at high recalls [].",0
"Both approximate and exact search algorithms can benefit from this vectorized processing, as evaluating the distance ofmultiple vectors is unavoidable.",0
"Furthermore, partitioning dimensions allow pruning algorithms to be adaptive regarding the number of dimensions explored.",0
"This increases code size and is not future-proof, as new CPU architectures with different register widths and capabilities are in constant development.",0
"Algorithm shows pseudo-code for the Euclidean Distance (L2), Manhattan Distance (L1), and Inner Product (IP) kernels in the PDX layout.",0
"From our experiments, processing vectors at-a-time achieve the highest performance improvement in all major ISAs (NEON, AVX2, and AVX512).",0
"Finally, in section we study the alternate approach to use Algorithm on N-ary storage, by performing an on-the-fly gather (depicted in the rightmost part of Figure ).",0
The latter could be used to tune the pruning process per block while being adaptive to potential distribution shifts when the variance of the vectors changes.,0
"Within vector databases, the typical workloads are bulk load, append, or complete rewrite (e.g., when the underlying model that produces the vectors changes).",0
It is important to note that the framework preserves the correctness and recall levels of the underlying pruning algorithm.,0
"At each fetching step, we calculate the partial distances, perform the pruning predicate evaluation (e.g., hypothesis testing on ADSampling, bounds evaluation in BOND), and keep track of the number of pruned vectors.",0
"However, by leveraging the block statistics (mean), one can prioritize 5instead, as its mean in the collection is the farthest from the query value.",0
"However, both the decreasing and distance-tomeans criteria affect the memory access efficiency of the algorithm: by making more jumps and accessing shorter memory stretches, automatic prefetching by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) of a CPU, that is triggered on detecting sequential access, becomes less efficient.",0
"In subsection , we experimentally evaluate the PDXearch framework by performing queries on an IVF index on our presented datasets, optimizing the distance calculation with ADSampling.",0
"Here, we compare the query throughput of the algorithm when using PDXearch against the search on the horizontal layout (Q2) .",0
"Finally, on the PDX version of the algorithms, we set to % the selection percentage threshold to advance through the PRUNE phase.",0
"For ADSampling and BSA algorithms, we used an optimized version of the original implementation that improves the performance of the query transformation phase.",0
"Crucial for pruning algorithms is that with few ( ) dimensions, PDX ismuch faster than horizontal kernels (-.4x speedup).",0
"Note that efficiency on distance computations with limited dimensions ( ) is crucial for pruning algorithms, which only fully scan the first dimensions and then break off full computation thanks to pruning.",0
"In this experiment, the recall is controlled by the nprobe parameter of the IVF index (at higher recalls, more buckets/blocks are accessed).",0
"While FAISS and Milvus are superior to the horizontal pruning algorithms in Zen4, the same is not true in the other microarchitectures, where the SIMD performance of ADSampling is not outperformed so heavily.",0
The only difference between both experiments is the number of dimensions explored at each step in the PDXearch algorithm.,0
We performed an experiment disabling the compiler vectorization ( -fno-vectorize -fno-tree-vectorize -fno-slp-vectorize flags).,0
"In this experiment, the CPU profiling of AMD shows that PDXearch executes twice as many instructions per cycle, incurs 4x fewer branch mispredictions (retiring 3x fewer branch instructions), and hits twice as much the L2 cache when compared to the vector-byvector search (Q2).",0
"Another finding of our experiments is that BSA can be slower than ADSampling, especially at datasets of lower dimensionality (top row of Figure ), where it loses to all the other PDX-competitors.",0
"Table shows how the IVF query runtime of algorithms is distributed into four phases: query preprocessing, finding nearest buckets in the IVF index, bounds evaluation for pruning, and distance calculation.",0
"The PDX versions of the algorithms drastically reduce the time spent evaluating bounds on both ADSampling and BSA, thanks to the branchless code we use to evaluate bounds (code is vectorized), evaluating bounds fewer times (incremental steps), and avoiding the interleaving of distance calculations and bounds evaluation.",0
"The PDX version of the algorithms not only decreases Distance Calculation cost, but also the Bounds Evaluation latency, thanks to vectorized execution.",0
PDXearch Across Architectures Figure summarizes our experiments across all architectures as the geometric mean of speedup obtained across all datasets (at all recall levels in approximate search) against a baseline: Scikit-learn in exact search and a scalar (non-SIMDized) linear scan in the IVF index search.,0
"These benchmarks align with our experiments, which also showed a similarly increased amount of ops and instructions retired across architectures.",0
"Despite these indexes still finding benefits from DCO optimization [ ,], the notion of blocks is not intrinsically present in these data structures.",0
"Here, a block could represent neighborhoods of the graph; consequently achieving the desired benefits of our proposed layout and pruning algorithm.",0
"Vector-databases like Weaviate [ ] and Milvus [ ] have surged as a new category of data systems, but (relational) database systems have also added capabilities for vector storage, search, and indexing.",0
"Typically, when database systems implement an array data type, their implementation stores each array as one data item (the horizontal vector layout).",0
"Thus, PDX would be well-suited for integration in database systems such as DuckDB [], which also support floats compression [].",0
"Therefore, we redirect readers to the surveys done in Vector Databases systems [ ], approximate graphindexes [ ], approximate hashing indexing [ ,], quantization methods [ ,] and benchmarking frameworks [ ,].",0
This section focuses on the scenario in which the PDX layout shines: algorithms that avoid the distance evaluation on every dimension.,0
"The PDX layout speeds up search, makes pruning algorithms more efficient, and can co-exist with indexes and quantization techniques.",0
This layout allowed to prioritize the order in which the algorithm visited dimensions while still benefiting from sequential access to the data.,0
The goal of ADSampling [ ] is to quickly determine when vectors have a low probability of making it to the KNN candidate list of a query.,0
"Furthermore, we introduced PDXearch, a search framework that allows pruning algorithms to be adaptive to any query and dataset and improve cache efficiency.",0
We also introduced PDX-BOND: a pruning algorithm that does not need data transformations (it works on raw floats) and does not have any recall trade-off (can be used for exact search).,0

"Clones are many-sorted algebraic structures abstracting the composition of finitary operations, and play a central role in universal algebra and theoretical computer science.",0
"Inspired by the algebraic studies of conditional statements in programming, we provide an equational axiomatisation of this class of clones, which we call partition clones.",0
"Partition clones arise from Boolean algebras via a natural construction, and we show that every partition clone can be actually constructed in this way.",0
"Finally, we investigate the algebras associated with partition clones; we prove that they correspond precisely to sets equipped with an action of a Boolean algebra, aligning with a well-known definition due to Bergman.",0
"We would like to thank Antonio Bucciarelli, Pierre-Louis Curien, and Antonino Salibra for their useful comments and their thorough proofreading of preliminary versions of this work.",0
"Precisely as monoids are the algebraic structures that serve to represent the composition of functions from a set to itself, clones are structures that aim at modelling the composition of functions of arbitrary finite arity.",0
"Clones hold significant importance in universal algebra, enabling the study of varieties in a way independent of their presentation (i.e. of their signature and equations): despite having different presentations, two varieties having the same clone of term-operations can be essentially regarded as the same.",0
"Thanks to a landmark observation due to Lawvere [], clones can be exploited to lay the foundations of categorical universal algebra.",0
"Motivated by the significance of the clone Nof projections in these considerations, this paper aims to investigate the variety of clones generated by N. We begin by reviewing the notion of a clone as an -sorted algebra namely, a sequence {T(n) :n }of sets whose elements are to be interpreted as functions or term-operations, along with operators that compose a function of arity nwith nfunctions of arity m. We emphasise that this concrete and syntactic formulation of clones conforms to Lawvere s foundational perspective while also enabling the application of tools from classical universal algebra and equational logic.",0
"Next, we recall the notion of an algebra for a clone: a T-algebra for a clone Tis a natural generalisation of a set equipped with a monoid action.",0
"Since the class of T-algebras forms a variety of one-sorted algebras, this concept gives rise to a fundamental duality between clones and varieties of one-sorted algebras.",0
"We then turn our attention to an equationally defined class of clones that we refer to as partition clones , for reasons that will become evident later.",0
"The axiomatisation of this class was inspired by recent works in algebraic logic aimed at generalising classical propositional logic to the case of an arbitrary finite number of symmetric truth values [, , ].",0
"These studies draw heavily on the analysis of the if-then-else operator in programming, first initiated in [] and further developed in e.g. [, ].",0
"A precursor to this line of research is, of course, the axiomatisation of Boolean algebras using the if-then-else operator as primitive [].",0
"An important class of partition clones arises as follows: given a Boolean algebra B, the set of finite sequences of elements of Bthat are pairwise disjoint and whose join equals the top element of Bforms a partition clone.",0
"For example, when Bis the two-element Boolean algebra, this construction precisely yields the clone N. The main contribution of this paper is a completeness result: every partition clone P={P(n) :n }can be obtained by applying the above construction to P, which we show to have the structure of a Boolean algebra.",0
This result follows as a consequence of a theorem establishing an equivalence of categories between Boolean algebras and partition clones.,0
"the Boolean algebra P. Besides the categorical equivalence, partition clones also share key algebraic and structural properties with Boolean algebras.",0
"By adapting and generalising the well-known argument that establishes that the twoelement Boolean algebra is the only subdirectly irreducible one, we show that Nis the only subdirectly irreducible partition clone.",0
"Since Nis the minimal nondegenerate clone, the variety generated by Nis the unique atom in the lattice of subvarieties of clones.",0
"Varieties of clones are an interesting object of study in their own right, as they naturally model the concept of an equationally defined class of varieties , and they are indeed known as hypervarieties BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS AS CLONES (a detailed discussion of this concept can be found in the paragraphs following Theorem ).",0
"In this work, Bergman provides axioms for the action of a Boolean algebra Bon a set, called a B-set, and establishes a sheaf representation of these structures.",0
"We prove that for any partition clone P, theP-algebras are precisely sets equipped with an action of the Boolean algebra P. We note that Bergman had already shown that the class of B-sets, as Branges over Boolean algebras, forms a minimal nontrivial hypervariety, and therefore our results give an alternative proof of this fact.",0
"In Section we introduce our equational definition of partition clones (Definition ), which is central to the development of the paper and serves as the basis for most of the results.",0
"Then, we present the main example of a partition clone namely, the partitions of the top element of a Boolean algebra and define the Boolean algebra associated with a partition clone.",0
"In Section we introduce the concept of hypervariety and establish two results: (i) the variety of partition clones is generated by N(Theorem ), and (ii) the variety of partition clones forms an atom in the lattice of hypervarieties (Theorem ).",0
In the final section we show that the algebras for a partition clone are precisely sets equipped with an action of a Boolean algebra (see Definition and Theorem ).,0
"Given an I-sorted signature , a -algebra is an I-sorted set Atogether with an ( I< I)-indexed family of functions such that for every operation symbol f i1,...,i n,ithere is a function fA:Ai1 Ain Ai.",0
We recall two important adaptations to the many-sorted case of classic results due to Birkhoff that will play a prominent role in what follows; for the terminology of Theorem see [].,0
"The equational classes of algebras are precisely the classes of -algebras closed under products, subalgebras, surjective homomorphisms, and directed unions.",0
"Standard references for the categorical approach to universal algebra through algebraic theories are [, Chapter ] and [].",0
"Otherwise stated, the following square commutes: T(n) T(m)n AmT(n) An T(m) AmA For each m, the set T(m) is a T-algebra with the action ngiven by qn m,n .",0
"To justify this claim, let be a (one-sorted, finitary) signature of operation symbols, and consider a variety Vof -algebras.",0
"Clearly, eachT-algebra is a -algebra in the usual sense with the interpretation of the operation symbols given by the action.",0
"Let Var( T) be the class of T-algebras; as Var( T) is closed under products, subalgebras and homomorphic images, Var( T) is a variety.",0
Therefore for each clone Twe can construct a variety of algebras over a signature in the usual universal-algebraic sense.,0
"Moreover, remark that for every n the underlying set of the free algebra FVar(T)(n) generated by a finite set nof generators, coincides with T(n), justifying our earlier definition.",0
"BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS AS CLONES Clearly, given a signature , the class of -algebras forms a category, of which a variety Vof -algebras is a full subcategory.",0

"These are activities that are valuable and feasible for an economy, making a relatedness-complexity diagram a simple and intuitive tool to reason about strategic diversification (an idea similar to an efficient frontier in formal economic models of portfolio optimization38 ).",0
"Here, we address this gap by introducing an optimization method to identify diversification opportunities while considering the path dependencies implied by an economy s existing productive structure.",0
We show that this optimization procedure results in recommendations that are substantially different from those obtained from visually inspecting relatedness-complexity diagrams and that are better at leveraging an economy s existing capacities.,0
"In fact, an economy s probability of entering or exiting an activity is better approximated by models that include relatedness as one of many variables.",0

"In the world of international development, it is common for economies that are wildly different to receive sectoral advice motivated by global trends regardless of an economy s local capacities (e.g. AI, Big Data, Sustainable Energy, Biotech).",0

"Here, we address the first three limitations by introducing an optimization method that helps move the practical use of economic complexity methods beyond the use of heuristics and the visual inspection of relatedness-complexity diagrams.",0
Our approach involves defining a target level of economic complexity or economic growth and using an optimization method to identify a portfolio of new activities that minimizes a measure of the effort required to enter them.,0
"The optimization method also includes a forward-looking model that we use to derive a future Product Complexity Index (PCI) for products, incorporating the second line of criticism.",0
"Armed with this model, we then explore the properties of this optimization procedure using international trade data by country and employment by industry data for cities in the United States.",0
"We find that ECI optimization suggests activities that are better at leveraging an economy s comparative advantage, while adjusting the level of relatedness according to its stage of development.",0
"In sum, the ECI optimization method advances the practical use of economic complexity by providing a quantitatively rigorous approach for the support of economic development strategies.",0
Results The ECI Optimization Method The ECI optimization process begins by defining a target level of economic complexity which we operationalize by either selecting directly a value for the economic complexity index (ECI) or by choosing that value indirectly by inverting the empirically observed relationship between growth and ECI.,0
"# # is the number of activities in which economy c specializes in after the optimization has taken place, and # are the predicted product complexity indexes of the activities at time ( + ).",0
"For illustration and clarity purposes, we minimize the sum of comparative advantages as our criterion, since it provides reasonable results and avoids some limitations of other optimization constraints.",0
"For instance, minimizing the added volume of employment or exports biases the optimization process towards smaller activities.",0
"We justify this assumption by noting that while the PCI values would change after the optimization, here we optimize only one economy, which should translate into a minor impact on #.",0
"Despite this limitation, ECI optimization should enhance the application of economic complexity methods by providing a more strategic and forward-looking approach to diversification.",0
"Second, ECI optimization adopts a forward-looking perspective by integrating forecasts of changes in both RCA and complexity values over time.",0
Example We illustrate the ECI Optimization method by drawing an effort (W)-complexity (PCI) diagram (Figure ) for the economy of Vietnam.,0
"The optimization process begins by selecting activities in the upper-left quadrant (Figure a), which represent the most efficient choices in terms of the tradeoff between complexity and effort.",0
a) ECI Optimization effort-complexity diagram for Vietnam s exports to reach a target ECI of (starting from an ECI of ).,0
Properties of ECI Optimization We explore the properties of the ECI optimization method by comparing it with a benchmark that approximates a common practice in the use of relatedness-complexity diagrams.,0
This shows that ECI optimization suggests products where countries currently have higher specialization compared to those suggested by the benchmark.,0
"But this is also an important difference between the two methods, as it shows that ECI optimization focuses on activities that leverage existing capacities (as expressed in products close to full levels of specialization (e.g. RCA~)).",0
"Compared to the benchmark, ECI optimization selects products that are relatively more unrelated for lower and middle complexity economies.",0
"The relationship defined by the ECI optimization choices also has a curvature resembling the one observed for the optimal diversification model introduced by Alshamsi et al.,, which shows that effective diversification strategies require targeting both related and unrelated activities.",0
"This is confirmed by the inset of Figure 4b, which shows that the standard deviation of the recommended activities drastically increases for countries with a medium-high value of ECI (ECI~).",0
"Hence, ECI optimization may endogenously lead to a more balanced portfolio of related/unrelated activities in accordance with models of optimal portfolio diversification, balancing the pursuit of complex products with the feasibility associated with their relatedness.",0
"We find that the ECI optimization method suggests slightly lower additional volume compared to the benchmark model (around USD 1B on average), suggesting that it effectively balances the trade-off between the feasibility of expanding export volumes and the potential gains in economic complexity.",0
a) Average RCA (in ) of the products suggested by ECI optimization and the benchmark model as a function of a country s ECI in .,0
"Overall, these results suggest that ECI optimization recommends activities where economies already have some comparative advantage while balancing relatedness with the required level of added output.",0
"Second, we use the interaction of ECI with the z-score of the initial log of GDP per capita, capturing the idea that the contribution of economic complexity to future economic growth is stronger for lower income economies.",0
We also use period fixed effects in order to account for any omitted variables that vary over the two decades and may impact economic growth.,0
Once we estimate the parameters of the model (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Information) we can set a target growth rate and invert the equation to find the ECI which is compatible with that level of growth.,0
We start by using our steppingstone model to estimate the export structure of these countries and their corresponding ECI in without any optimization.,0
"Next, we use our growth regression model to provide an estimate for the expected economic growth rate that supports the predicted ECI.",0
"In each case, ECI optimization suggests the products located in the top left of the diagram, which are high gain and low effort.",0
"In Figure 5c, we summarize the ECI Optimization output for Thailand in a table, listing the products in the order of the first target growth rate they recommended, up to the target of %.",0
"For lower targets, the ECI Optimization method suggests products like : Electrical Capacitors and : Iron Springs, which Thailand can develop with relatively low effort.",0
"For lower ECI targets, the ECI Optimization method recommends goods like : Metal Insulating Fittings and : Additive Manufacturing Machines, while higher ECI targets introduce additional products such as : Metal Molds into the portfolio.",0
"Discussion Economic complexity applications often rely on straightforward interpretations of relatedness-complexity diagrams, overlooking nuanced optimization aspects such as the fact that relatedness is only one component of a diversification potential model or that comparative advantages change over time.",0
This method provides a structured approach to strategic diversification by modeling future specialization patterns and using these forecasts to inform an optimization framework.,0
"By applying model predictions as weights within a linear program, the ECI Optimization method identifies a portfolio of activities that achieve a target level of economic complexity with minimal cost.",0
"We visualized the ECI Optimization in a cost-complexity diagram, where potential activities are mapped based on their complexity and the cost required to develop comparative advantage in each.",0
The optimization algorithm begins by selecting activities in the top-left of this diagram those with high complexity and low cost and gradually incorporates additional activities toward the top-right as higher complexity targets are pursued.,0
We observed that ECI Optimization recommends a portfolio of target activities that naturally balances among related and unrelated activities following what is predicted by the optimal diversification theory of Alshamsi et al.,0
"Finally, we demonstrated the practical application of ECI Optimization by incorporating it in a simple framework that exploits the knowledge of a target economic growth rate in order to suggest activities that optimize the desired outcome.",0
"First, although the ECI Optimization method offers a structured approach to enhancing economic complexity, it may render the ECI susceptible to Goodhart s Law: when a measure becomes a target for optimization, it can lose its efficacy as an accurate indicator.",0
"While economic complexity methods are commonly used to suggest activities that could drive economic growth, it is crucial to remember that the index itself is a philosophically positive measure.",0
"Thus, any application of ECI optimization should not stop at the generated recommendations but should also delve into the broader dynamics that shape these outcomes.",0
",,, While this allowed us for easy analytical formulation of the optimization procedure (in terms of a linear zero-one integer problem), it could be the case that more obscure but more precise machine learning models perform better.",0
"Indeed, future efforts to build on this ECI optimization idea could explore the benefits of using more comprehensive diversification models and specifications, including not easily invertible functions (e.g. functions considering multiple steppingstones (separately for specialization and relatedness)).",0
"Fourth, our optimization model primarily considers a single dimension of economic activity such as international trade data or industrial activities within MSAs.",0
"Yet, despite these limitations, ECI Optimization advances the policy toolkit of economic complexity by providing a mathematically grounded approach for strategic diversification.",0
"Regression model parameter estimation: We use an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach to estimate the parameters defined in equation , applying it separately for each initial year within a fixed timeframe and stepping stone .",0

"In previous experiments (including CUORE, CUPIDand CUPID-Mo), NTD Ge thermistors were attached to the crystals using the bi-component epoxy glue Araldite Rapid, chosen for its excellent performance at cryogenic temperatures and high radiopurity.",0
"However, the fast curing time of Araldite Rapid ( minutes), limited the gluing operation to one crystal at a time in past experiments.",0
"Switching to Araldite Slow, with a curing time of about hour, would allow multiple crystals to be glued in a single batch, significantly accelerating the mass production process for CUPID.",0

These growth optimizations are tested and validated in dedicated smaller fast turnaround cryogenic measurement campaigns with promising initial results.,0
"If we exclude all the TEST crystals from the computation, the median energy resolution at keV would be keV FWHM with a standard deviation of keV.",0
"The baseline resolution of LDs, evaluated as for the LMOs, varies in the range keV FWHM with a median value of keV FWHM and a standard deviation of keV, as shown in Fig. .",0

"Welfare Effects of Self-Preferencing by a Platform: Empirical Evidence from Airbnb Kaede Hanazawa March , Abstract This paper studies the welfare effects of self-preferencing by Airbnb, a practice where Airbnb utilizes its pricing algorithm to prioritize maximizing platform-wide commission revenue rather than optimizing individual host revenues.",0
"These findings highlight the significant trade-offs between platform-driven revenue optimization and market efficiency, emphasizing the urgent need for competition policy reforms and greater transparency and accountability in platform practices.",0
"GN] Mar Introduction With the rapid advancement of digital technology, platform industries have emerged as a dominant force in the global economy.",0
"To examine the research question, I specifically focus on Airbnb and its self-preferencing through a pricing algorithm, Smart Pricing (SP) .",0
"Providers of these accommodations, referred to as hosts, are charged a % service fee on their earnings by Airbnb.3Since , Airbnb has offered a pricing algorithm, SP, which allows hosts to delegate price determination to the algorithm.4Hosts retain the option to use SP at their discretion.",0
"2Based on the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry s Survey Report on the Electronic Commerce Market https://www.meti.go.jp/policy/it_policy/statistics/outlook/ R5tyousahoukokusho.pdf , accessed October , .",0
"First, the consumer demand is modeled using the random coefficient nested logit demand model, estimated with the Berry et al. s algorithm (BLP).",0
"This highlights Airbnb s strong incentive for engaging in self-preferencing, as the platform captures a greater share of market surplus through its pricing algorithms.",0
"Given the lack of transparency requirements for algorithms, the findings call for urgent discussions on competition policy and algorithmic accountability to mitigate such adverse effects.",0
"This paper contributes to three key strands of literature: (i) platform self-preferencing, (ii) algorithmic pricing, and (iii) the impact of Airbnb on the hotel industry.",0
"This is largely because the algorithms used by platforms are unobservable, making it difficult to infer causal relationships between social welfare and self-preferencing.",0
"Among these, this paper is particularly related to Harrington Jr .7He theoretically analyzed the incentives of competing firms in a duopoly market for differentiated products and a firm that develops and sells pricing algorithms.",0
My analysis differs from Harrington Jr by focusing on a platform that provides pricing algorithms to its users for free.,0
"Airbnb has an incentive to maximize its commission revenue from transactions through pricing algorithms.8By measuring the effect of this platform-specific incentive on social welfare, I make a novel contribution to the literature.",0
"However, it should be noted that I do not analyze the positive welfare effects of pricing algorithms, such as improved demand forecasting or reduced pricing costs, as discussed by Mikl os-Thal and Tucker and O Connor and Wilson .",0
"7See also Johnson et al. , which examines how Amazon can design its recommendation system to prevent collusion when sellers use pricing algorithms and provide the simulation result using machine learning.",0
"This table presents the means and standard deviations of prices, the number of reviews, evaluation indices (such as location, staff communication, cleanliness, and overall room rating), and the number of available units, separately for Airbnb accommodations and hotels listed on Booking.com across all periods in the wards of Tokyo.",0
These descriptive statistics reveal two key heterogeneities that underscore the differences between Airbnb hosts and hotels: prices and ratings.,0
"The classification of whether a host operates low-priced listings is conducted as follows: (i) perform -level clustering based on prices for both Airbnb hosts and hotels on Booking.com using the k-means method, (ii) interpret listings in the bottom two clusters as low-priced.",0
"In Appendix A., I present the equations for the market share and demand of product j, as well as the formulas for calculating consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social welfare.",0
Estimation Strategy I estimate the demand model by BLP algorithm using Conlon and Gortmaker s Python package PyBLP .14Prices and within-nest market shares are likely to be correlated with the structural error term jmbecause firms set prices with knowledge of productand market-specific consumer valuations.,0
"To address this, I use three types of instrumental variables: (i) the number of products in each category defined by K-Means clustering, (ii) the measures of product differentiation ( differentiation instruments ) proposed by Gandhi and Houde which intuitively capture the relative isolation of each product in characteristics space, and (iii) own product characteristics, Xjm.15For differentiation IVs, I employ both the Euclidean distances across continuous characteristics between a focal product and others and their interactions.",0
This exclusion is necessary because the presence of products with market shares approaching zero complicates estimation and prevents the BLP algorithm from converging.,0
"Since marginal costs are assumed to be constant, the marginal cost for each non-SP host and hotel can be calculated from equation .",0
"Therefore, in the case of the baseline scenario, the observed prices are substituted into equation to compute marginal costs. .",0
"Since we have already estimated demand and calculated the marginal cost, the counterfactual equilibrium prices can be calculated from the new first-order conditions under the environment described in Table , using the contraction mapping algorithm proposed by Morrow and Skerlos .",0
"The Airbnb dummy is estimated to have a negative effect ( and ) on demand, though the standard deviation of this effect is imprecisely estimated.",0
"This discrepancy suggests that the absence of algorithmic support for non-SP hosts leaves them at a strategic disadvantage, limiting their ability to translate higher prices into meaningful profit gains.",0
"This paradox suggests that in a market dominated solely by Airbnb hosts, the algorithm s adjustments lead to unsustainable price hikes that erode profitability for SP hosts.",0
"From a policy perspective, this conclusion suggests that competition authorities need to pay close attention to the opaque nature of algorithmic decision-making and pricing practices.",0
"Since these algorithms are proprietary and remain hidden from public scrutiny, policymakers may need to consider targeted interventions to improve transparency and accountability.",0
This could involve mandating at least partial disclosures of algorithmic objectives or outcomes and introducing guidelines that limit certain forms of strategic self-preferencing.,0
"Specifically, when Airbnb implements self-preferencing by offering hosts a pricing algorithm (SP) designed to maximize the platform s total commission revenue, my analysis reveals a significant negative impact on social welfare, with an average decline of %.",0
"These findings have significant policy implications, particularly in light of the widespread lack of transparency and accountability regarding the algorithm they employ.",0
"Although I focused on Airbnb, my findings can be applied more generally to marketplace platforms such as Amazon and Mercari which provide the pricing algorithm to sellers.",0
"First, while I analyze the impact of self-preferencing on welfare through the incentives of platforms, I do not capture the potential positive effects of pricing algorithms.",0
"I indicate the computation of the choice probability (i.e., the demand) for product jin marketmand the calculation of consumer welfare in the RCNL model.",0

EFFECTS FROM KAON DISTORTION AND KINEMATICS Before we will show results for the heavy hypernuclei we discuss in more detail e ects from re-scattering of kaons in the nal state and from shifting the hypernucleus mass due to an excitation energy.,0
"Hereandin the previous hypernucleus DWIA calculations [, ] we have utilized an improved version of the separable KN amplitude which includes the partial waves up to l= and which can describe the available KNdata up to the invariant energy of about GeV.",0
The nucleon density in Eq. is described by the Hartree-Fock (HF) form which is taken from the HF many-particle calculations consistently with OBDME.,0

The curves are plotted with FWHM = keV. pend on behavior of the nucleus density in the peripheral regionratherthan in the nuclearinterior.,0
In our present calculations we use the HF densities which provide a more realistic optical potential and which are obtained in the many-particle calculations being consistent with the values of OBDMEs.,0
"As we mentioned above, in determination of kinematics we use the hypernucleus mass shifted by excitation energy of given state: M H=M0 H+E whereM0 Hand E are the hypernucleus ground-state mass and excitation energy, respectively.",0
Even if this mass shift is relatively very small it can change values of some particle momenta even by a few percent and therefore the elementary amplitude and the radial integrals can notably change their values.,0
"In Table I we show how a relatively tiny shift of the mass propagates into variations of the momenta, the elementary amplitude, the radial integral, and nally how it changes the cross section.",0
"The results, calculated in PWIA at photon energy E = GeV, are shown for two states of208 Tl with the same spin to see variations of the e ect in dependence on E .",0
"Whereas changes of the momenta are proportional to the excitation energy, the radial integral reveals di erent e ects and therefore the cross section can be less suppressed for the larger shift.",0
"The value of the radial integral is given by the overlap of the proton and single-particle wave functions and the function proportional to the spherical Bessel function in PWIA, FLM( B ) jL( B ), see Eq. .",0
It is also remarkable in the table that the particle momenta decrease due to the mass shift but the momentum transfer rises and that the proton momentum|/vector popt|signi cantly changes which then markedly affects the value of the elementary amplitude.,0
"d d TTABLE I. Changes, in % with respect to the ground-state values, are due to the mass shift for two states of208 Tl: (E [MeV],JP H).",0
"Despite the fact that the cross sections for various states can change in di erent way, as one can see in Table I, the overall e ect in the excitation spectrum is monotonously rising with the excitation energy as shown in Fig. .",0

The energy dependence of the e ects reveals a resonant-like structure in some cases and more pronounced e ects are observed for energies below GeV.,0
This longitudinal contribution also makes the pronounced resonant structures in the energy dependent cross sections in Fig. .,0

In the case of the original spectrum the rst hypernucleus doublet is based on the ground state of207Tl and the second doublet on the excited state +at MeV. This excitation energy then gives the splitting about MeV of the doublets.,0

"Kurt Symanzik formulated a framework for Euclidean quantum eld theory in [ Sym68 ], establishing a profound connection between Euclidean quantum e ld theory and the structure of classical statistical mechanics.",0
The goal of this current paper is to consider Symanzik s loop expansion idea for Euclidean quantum eld theory in the context of the so-called H2/divid s.alt02supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma model in relation to a class of random processes with reinforcement.,0
"There is a vast literatur e in the probability community on the Poissonian or Brownian loop soup, in particular on the study of local times [ Ray63 , Kni63 ], occupational time elds and isomorphism theorems [ Dyn80 ,Eis05 ,EKM+], random interlacements [ Szn12a ,Lup16 ] and the list is far beyond our ability to survey here.",0

A key feature of modern concurrent separation logics is support for proving that data structures are logically atomic [da Rocha Pinto et al .,0

"This internalizes the idea of linearizability , a standard notion of correctness for concurrent data structures, and enables modular and compositional proofs.",0
It is natural to consider whether similar techniques can be applied to reason about randomized concurrent data structures.,0

"Indeed, even developing a suitable notion of what logical atomicity would look like in the presence of randomization is challenging.",0

"Finally, the third rule says that an error credit of 1implies False ,i.e., we can deduce anything, which intuitively follows from the idea that an upper bound of probability is trivial.",0
The key steps in this proof are to apply the ht-rand-exp rule twice to reason about the two rand 3statements in the proof.,0

"Finally, threads can access the assertion inside of the invariant using ht-inv-open , which requires that the invariant is restablished after the atomic expression finishes executing.",0
"But we cannot use ht-inv-open to open this invariant when using the above specification for incrCntr , because incrCntr is not an atomic expression.",0
"Fornon-probabilistic concurrent programs, a standard solution to this problem is to derive a specification that captures that incrCntr behaves as if it were atomic when incrementing the value in the counter.",0
"At its core, the idea behind HOCAP is to observe that what makes a physically atomic expression special, in terms of the rules of the logic, is that we can open an invariant around a physically atomic step.",0
"Thus, to capture that an operation behaves as if it is atomic, we need a specification style that allows for opening an invariant at the logical point where an operation takes effect.",0

"We can view pexec as a relaxation of exec which keeps probability mass on configurations that are not final, whereas the latter only considers final configurations.",0
Introduction to Coneris The Coneris logic is built on top of the Iris base logic [Jung et al .] and inherits all of the basic propositions and their associated proof rules.,0
"The theorem says that by proving a Hoare triple for the expression , assuming initial ownership ofE( )error credits, then for all schedulers , the probability of the program returning a value notsatisfying the proposition is smaller than or equal to .",0
"In addition, we have another safety theorem that provides an upper bound on the probability of the expression getting stuck.",0
"If{E( )} {True}, then for all schedulers with mass 1and integers , the mass of pexec , ( ,([ ], ))is greater or equal to .",0

"In the programming language, presampling tapes appear as two new ghost code constructs, tape andrand 1 2, that are used to allocate a new presampling tape and sample from a tape, respectively.",0
"Modular Specifications of Concurrent Randomized Modules In this section, we first provide an overview of how HOCAP-style specifications capture logically atomicity of concurrent data structures.",0
"Next, we explain how we extend the approach to capture randomized logical atomicity and present a modular specification for the randomized counter module.",0
"Intuitively, these two parts of the view shift capture two separately logically atomic actions of the increment operation.",0
"By exposing the abstract presampling tape explicitly, we aim to capture more of the proof principles for a concrete randomized operation.",0
"In other words, the randomization of the increment operation acts logically atomic as expressed by a single probabilistic update, even if in reality, it is not.",0
"Since the new specification of the randomized concurrent counter utilizes tapes, we annotate the conTwoAdd client to use the abstract tapes exposed in the specification: conTwoAdd let =createCntr()in let =createCtape()in incrCntr |||let =createCtape()in incrCntr  ; readCntr Recall that we expect the return value to be 0with a probability /.",0
"We present here a high level of the proof, and defer the details to Appendix A. Most of this proof is similar to the one sketched in where we allocate an invariant that encodes a protocol that tracks both the available amount of error credits and the ghost state of both threads and describes how they can evolve.",0
"The probabilistic update modality allows us to open the invariant, obtain error credits from it, presample onto our abstract tapes, redistribute the error credits, and close the invariant again, all in an atomic manner.",0
This kind of local tape principle lets each thread own its own randomness and this helps simplify the proof since we need not worry how the state of ctape is changed by other external concurrent threads.,0
Note that the view shift of the Hoare triple captures the fact that this re-distribution of error credits happens in a logically-atomic manner.,0
The rest of the proof follows directly by applying the specification for incrementing the counter with the tape and reading from it twice.,0
"This is because this specification restricts the error redistribution to only occur within the incrCntr call, and we are unable to combine the two separate error redistribution operations in each incrCntr call into one atomic action.",0

"In other words, we capture randomized logically atomicity of the module, in the sense that externally, there appears to be a single randomized transition within the incrCntr function.",0
"As we later see in , this ability can greatly simplify the probabilistic analysis of concurrent data structures that use hashing.",0
"Implementation of Concurrent Bloom Filter Bloom Filter Bloom filters are approximate data structures to represent sets, with operations for inserting elements and querying for membership.",0
"Thus, when checking the membership of an element that is not in the set there exists a small probability of observing a false positive if there are hash collisions with previously inserted elements.",0
"In this case study, we implement a concurrent Bloom filter and prove a bound on the probability of observing a false positive result on a membership query.",0
"From a mathematical perspective, the probability of false positive corresponds to the following experiment: first sample a batch of integers uniformly at random in {,..., }.",0
"Intuitively, concurrent implementations of Bloom filters should have the same probability of false positive, since parallel queries to hash functions are independent.",0
Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs Our modular approach allows us to simplify the mathematical reasoning within the proof of the specification and defer all complex combinatiorial reasoning to the meta-level.,0
"The proof crucially relies on both the stateful representation of error probabilities ( i.e., error credits) as well as the notion of randomized logical atomicity, which allows us to presample all randomness in advance.",0
"Let Efp( , )be the probability of observing a false positive for a single membership query after setting uniformly selected indices to 1in an array that already contains bits set to .",0
"=false} i.e., the probability of false positive is at most Efp( | |,), which corresponds to the theoretical bound given by Bose et al .",0
"To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a tight bound on the probability of false positives for a concurrent Bloom filter .",0
Other Case Studies Other case studies demonstrating the flexibility of our approach in verifying concurrent randomized data structures can be found in Appendix C. We first define a Rand module that captures the operation of sampling from a uniform distribution atomically and we provide three implementations that satisfy it (similar to the implementations in the randomized counter module from ).,0
We also implement a concurrent collision-free hash data structure and show that it meets an amortized error specification; the error required for each presampling operation is fixed as it is amortized across a fixed number of insertions.,0

"Firstly, if the error budget is larger or equal to , the precondition holds trivially as all sub-distributions have mass smaller or equal to (state-steperr).",0

"In this setting, every interactive proof between the verifier and the provers can be turned into a perfect zero-knowledge one, i.e., MIP=PZK -MIP [BOGKW88 ].",0
"Moreover, as the verifier can communicate with multiple provers separately and cross-check their proofs, the verifier s capability is also strengthened.",0
"Although a classical verifier might seem weaker than the quantum one, they can utilize self-tests to verify whether the provers are behaving honestly [ MY98 ], which are tools absent in the classical case.",0

"Usually to shield potential information leakage, one may take advantage of the principles of relativity [ Bel04 ]: The verifier is posed between the provers, and the provers are spatially separated far enough so that they cannot exchange information before their answers reach the verifier due to the light speed restriction.",0
"Therefore, as the communication cost gets lower and the verification time gets shorter, the spatial configuration can be made more compact and the spatial separation condition is enforced more easily.",0
"Besides the motivation to validate a multi-prover setting, succinctness has always been desirable for practical applications of zero-knowledge proofs [ Kil92 ].",0

"The third step is to apply answer reduction, where the prover who gets both questions computes a succinct proof, i.e., a probabilistic checkable proof (PCP), that his/her answers satisfy the verifier s checks.",0
"Instead of reading the entire answers, the verifier only needs to query bits of the answers and the succinct proof, which also reduces the answer length and verification time exponentially.",0
"To prove Theorem , there is one more technical point before we apply the four techniques to the PZK -MIP protocol for REwith a constant completeness-soundness gap in [ MS24 ].",0
"That is, Alice and Bob s measurement operators should commute if the two corresponding questions have a nonzero probability of being sampled by the verifier.",0
"When we apply this theorem to an MIP protocol, the completeness-soundness gap will shrink from a constant to an inverse polynomial.",0
Theorem is proved by first transforming the constraint-constraint protocol in [MS24] to a constraintvariable protocol and applying a parallel repetition to restore a constant completeness-soundness gap.,0
"Then, we apply the question reduction to reduce the question length to polylog, oracularization techniques of [NZ23 , Theorem ] to make the protocol suitable for answer reduction, and iteratively apply the tightened answer reduction technique of [ DFN+, Theorem ] to make the answer length a constant.",0

"Standard algorithms developed within this framework such as Upper-Confidence Bounds (UCB) absed algorithms (Auer et al., ) and Thompson sampling (TS) (Thompson, ; Russo et al., ) have proven to be useful in applications such as clinical trials, ad-placement strategies, etc.",0
"However, it remains difficult to apply them to more complicated real world settings such as those arising in agriculture or experimental sciences wherein the underlying uncertainty mechanism is far more sophisticated: the unknown reward distribution corresponding to each arm/action may not even conform to a parametric class of distributions such as the single-parameter exponential family, and usually exhibit characteristics such as multi-modality.",0
"With some abuse of terminology, we shall refer to this challenging setting of the MABs as non-parametric MABs, and we report an optimal algorithm for this setting in the current paper.",0

"Next, although Thompson-Sampling (TS) (Thompson, ; Kaufmann et al., ) is a neat and elegant Bayesian algorithm, that enjoys the flexibility of incorporating prior knowledge about the bandit environment, it s efficiency is limited to the regime ofconjugate prior/posterior distributions of the relevant scalar/vector parameter, which is generally not possible beyond a few special cases of bandit environments, e.g. Bernoulli, Gaussian.",0
"Additionally, these bootstrap sampling based algorithms cannot account for uncertainty that does not come from the observed data (Osband et al., ).",0
"In other words, they do not have a mechanism to incorporate prior knowledge about the environment which can be utilized to enhance the performance of the algorithm.",0
"This efficient harnessing of prior knowledge for improved performance is hallmark of Bayesian algorithms, and we are unaware of any bandit algorithm that enjoys the flexibility of being completely Bayesian and still efficient in the nonparametric MAB setting.",0
We answer this question in the affirmative by designing an algorithm that draws from the strengths of Bayesian Nonparametric (BN) priors.,0
"In the past, a nice line of work utilized BN priors on the function spaces , i.e. Gaussian Process (GP) priors, to contribute the well known GP-UCB algorithm (Srinivas et al., ), but it s not clear how this can be naturally adapted to the nonparametric MAB setting that we are interested in the current paper, and we believe that a more natural choice of BN priors in the context of multi-arm bandits would be the priors on the space of probability distributions instead of those on a much larger function space (restricted only by the choice of their smoothness) (Rasmussen, ).",0
"Dirichlet Processes (DPs), denoted as DP( ,F0), (where and F0are the related hyperparameters, known as the concentration parameter, and the base measure respectively), fall in the category of BN priors on the space of probability distributions, and have been widely used in real world statistical applications (Castillo, ; M ller et al., ; Ghosal, ), .",0

"Finally, the algorithm calls the minimal equivalence query with B. If the teacher answers yes, the algorithm terminates successfully; otherwise, nis incremented.",0

"In this paradigm, a user contributes to the power-of-tau generation with a tuple (ppt, t), where pptis the user s contribution and tis the zero-knowledge proof required for KnowledgeCheck in [] (see Section ).",0
"To mitigate the potentially high costs associated with verifying a fraud proof, we introduce an optimized fraud-proof mechanism.",0
"While the approach so far reduces the amount of computation required by the contract to verify the correctness of a fraud-proof, the verification still requires the contract to access (and thus store) the complete pptcontribution, which is expensive when the number of powers-of-tau increases.",0
"To reduce the storage overhead to verify a fraud proof, the Conly stores compp , which is the Merkle root the submitted pp2.",0
"When a challenge is raised against one contribution pp, the challenger also provide the membership proofs of the ill-formed elements in compp .",0
"To handle a fraudproof challenge, Ccan verify the membership proof with an insignificant gas cost, requiring only O(logd)calldata and hashing operations.",0
"Although Cno longer stores ppin its state, SandUcan still fetch the historic ppfrom blockchain transaction history e.g., for fraud proofs.",0
"Only when pptis ill-formed, a fraud-proof fraud will be submitted, andCcan verify fraud withO(logd)gas and then revert back to ppt .2gives an overview of our Aggregatable Contribution Scheme.",0
"Here, an operator receives contributions from multiple contributors, verifies them off-chain, aggregates the proofs, and submits the latest ppwith the constant-size proof.",0
"Second, a user that detects an invalid contribution to ppneeds to pinpoint the ill-formed element within ppto create the (succinct) fraud-proof.",0
"As we describe in Section , there exists a mechanism for the user to create such a proof with only a small performance cost.",0
"In summary, we have designed a fraud-proof-based ceremony protocol that asymptotically outperforms the stateof-the-art [], as shown in Table . .",0
"Aggregateable Contribution Despite the improvement above, the on-chain asymptotic costs remain O(m d)(in terms of calldata) for m contributors, as each contributor still needs to update the pp with proofs individually.",0
"Instead of having each contributor upload their own update onchain, we propose a (trustless) operator that aggregates contributors updates and proofs off-chain .",0
"*Aggregation is not considered in this comparision.their proofs, they submit updates to the operator to incorporate into pp.",0
"Once the operator has received mcontributions, it will execute a proof aggregation algorithm to generate a single proof from all individual proofs received from the contributors.",0
"Looking ahead, the succinctness of our aggregated proof and the efficiency of verification are crucial for practicality.",0
"The smart contract only needs to verify a proof consisting of a three group elements using three pairing operations, making this the first practical approach for Ethereum s KZG ceremony for PoT. Next, we provide an overview of our aggregation protocol.",0
"Meanwhile, this protocol achieves most of the promised goals: (i)the proof is aggregated into a constant-size proof ( andvk), consisting of only two group elements; (ii)it has the fire-and-f orgetproperty, as U2does not need to interact with U1except for obtaining , (Looking ahead, a trustless operator will take care of the relay of s to entirely eliminate interaction among users).",0
"and (iii) it produces a proof for the oblivious accumulated randomness, as neither U1norU2knows r r Three or More Contributors Case.",0
"Each new contributor U retrieves ppand from the previous contributor, updates pptopp , and computes the new proof = (pk , )using Equation .",0
"Verification of this update can be performed by anyone with access to all the public keys ( pks), using Equation where vkis the sum of all pks.",0
"With these checks in place, the protocol secures the inclusion of each contributor s randomness, and we formally prove its security in Theorem . ..",0
"The proof of possession approach can prevent intra-operator rogue key attacks, where the rogue keys exist among an operator s collected pks.",0
"Verifying all pks and PoPs would be too costly forC, as their total size scales linearly with the number of contributions, thus defeating the purpose of a constant-size aggregate proof.",0
"Now, the key cancellation trick cannot help a malicious Sto get rid of the prior vkpre because with overwhelming probability vk= 1vkpre+ 2vkcur= 1vk1+ 2( vk1+pk2) = ( 1 2)vk1+. .",0
"=e(vk , Q1)orpp.P1=IG1then : Aborts : Sets vkpre vk , prv= : Sets COMPP COMPP||Com(pp), + S=agg({ i}i [m]) ( m[ prv], m[ cur],vkcur=X i [m]pki) Finally, Ccomputes vk= 1vkpre+ 2vkcurand = 1 prv+ 2 curand uses Equation to verify them.",0
"Here, we propose Csamples {,}via the following hashing j=H(vkpre||vkcur|| prv|| cur||pp[Q1]||j)forj {,} We provide a formal security analysis and proofs against inter-operator rogue key attacks in Theorem (Lemma and Lemma ). .",0
"Construction and Security Analysis In this section, we formalize our ideas into algorithms and analyze the security of our proposed construction. .",0
This function enables a contributor to perform an off-chain update onppby communicating with Sand invoking S s ServerOffUpdate to provide the updated ppand proof.,0
"Finally, Figure summarizes who initiates each algorithm, the execution order, and the interaction during the algorithms execution.",0
"The following theorem states that if some pptis ill-formed, anyone can generate a fraud-proof from pptto rewind Cback to stage t .",0
"With negligible probability, there exists a proof derived from pptsuch that Cwill rewind itself back to stage t 1after receiving viaDisprove .",0
We define inclusion soundness by stating the above situation is computationally infeasible: A PPT Acannot correctly guess the trapdoor in the final ppwith non-negligible probability as long as Uhas confirmed its randomness inclusion via CheckInclusion .,0
"powers-of-tau system has inclusion soundness if for any n, k poly( ), any PPT adversary with qH=poly( ) queries to HG2andHZpcan win Game incl-sndwith only negligible probability.",0
"If there is an algebraic adversary Asndwho makes a correct guess on the from the final ppwith nonnegligible probability into breaking, we construct another adversary Bwhose use Asndto break (n, k)-SDH assumption.",0
"It means that to break the soundness of our aggregation scheme, Asndmust at least correctly guess the skfrom pk, therfrom pp, or breaking the PoP with non-negligible probability.",0
This optimization streamlines the update process to just two checks and the construction of a Merkle tree for the string.,0
"Furthermore, in the event that a fraud-proof is necessary, the associated cost is fairly low at only , gas (approximately US$ at current rates).",0
"Comparison of Gas Costs for Each Update with [] for n {,,,,,}andk= in both regular updates and fraud-proofs underscores the practical applicability of our protocol in blockchain environments where gas optimization is crucial.",0
"In the batched contribution setting, contributors and operators can locally verify the ppwith offthe-shelf optimizations.",0
"These optimizations enable Lite -PoT to efficiently process large volumes of contributions, demonstrating better scalability compared to existing approaches.",0
"To increase the confidence of users in the security of their application, it is in the providers interest to collect contributions from future users and provide inclusion proofs to them.",0
"Second, we could enhance security by adopting an approach similar to optimistic rollups, implementing a challenge period during which participants can submit fraud proofs to identify and reject invalid parameters.",0
"In the face of irrational attacks, our fraud-proof cost is also cheap enough ( US$ ) for the providers and future users to disprove without financial concerns.",0
"As the protocol is executed in a round-by-round manner, only one party can act on the pp and broadcast the message to other parties via a broadcast channel like a blockchain.",0
"However, this protocol limits the number of participants to a pre-selected set as its security proof requires a pre-commitment phase.",0
"[] avoids the pre-commitment phase by using a random beacon model, which is an abstraction of delayed randomness such as the hash value from a hashchain or blockchain.",0
[] optimizes Boew et al. s protocol by eliminating the use of a random beacon model and proves its security in the algebraic group model.,0
"In a nutshell, the (level-) blockchain accepts the off-chain transaction result without verifying it, unless a valid fraud proof is received.",0
It proposes a fraud-proof mechanism that a challenger can run a bisection game with the transaction submitter to pinpoint and prove the invalid operation in the transaction.,0
Our key contributions include (i)introducing an efficient fraud-proof mechanism to reduce the on-chain cost for each update; (ii)proposing a proof aggregation protocol to enable batching the contribution; (iii) defining the security notion of aggregated contribution and rigorously proving our Lite -PoT s security under AGM; and (iv)evaluating Lite -PoT s concrete cost and performance.,0

"In this setting, a contributor must inspect all KnowledgeCheck proofs of the updates after its submission to confirm the inclusion, leading toO(M)computation for a ceremony with Mcontributors (Mis the total number of contributors, while mis that in a batched update in our setting).",0

"Now, the contributor only needs to inspect MPoPs in its batch (acting like U) and runs Mprogressive key verification on the batches proofs (acting like C), resulting in O( M)computation.",0

", wkIG2), where pp is the latest valid PoT string on C. For the sake of simplicity, we assume all submisisons on the blockchain are valid and the pp are well-formed.",0
Note thatlogis merely a notation and does not imply an efficient algorithm that can compute the logarithm out of a group element.,0

"To leverage this fact, Falgcan run algorithm FAalgthat embeds the (n, k)-SDH instance into pklikeCalgdoes and extract z=sk.",0
"To handle this situation, Falgcould instead make use of another algorithm FBalgthat embeds the (n, k)-SDH instance into the random oracle like Ealg.",0
We start with showing that one of the final verification key vk 1must contains the simulator s pkwith overwhelming probability.,0
"In these cases, Dalg orEalg would not uses their skto simulate the submission, and thus give no additional advantage to Asndto preventing the simulator from extracting the solution by leveraging the above equations.",0

"We show that in a minisuperspace model, whic h is devoid of the shift vector, the problem is alleviated for locally Lorentz invariant GSTG theory, and d i eomorphic invariance is established at least for one connection.",0
We therefore construct the phase-space structure with three di erent spatially at connections fo r the Lorentz invariant linear-scalar-vector-tensor GSTG action.,0
Di eomorphic invariance is established and th e associated Hamiltonians are found to be well behaved for all the three cases.,0

We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function.,0
I. INTRODUCTION Superconductivity is a fascinating display of quantum effects acting at macroscopically observable scales through many-body interactions.,0
"The retardation effects originate from the Cooper pairs inside of these superconducting systems, which are bound together through an attracting force coming from the electron-phonon coupling.",0
"The latter is especially interesting: even though calculations with anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions better agree with experimental data, the suppression of Tc now causes an underestimation.",0
"In this work, we extend the Hamiltonian as used in [] by including the nonlinear -electron--phonon interaction to calculate the changes on the Eliashberg equations.",0
"We show that the Eliashberg equations are unaffected by this nonlinear electron-phonon term, except for a redefinition of the Eliashberg spectral function as first shown by [].",0
"The prefactors g(k,k ), (k,k , q) andu(q) are the matrix elements of the linear electronphonon, the nonlinear electron-phonon and the Coulomb interaction, respectively.",0
"To be able to set up the Eliashberg equations, one has to start by constructing a coupled pair of Dyson series for the superconducting system.",0
The latter two propagators are called anomalous since expectation values of this kind normally vanish with conservation of particle number.,0
Derivation of the Eliashberg equations results in two identical self-consistent equations for the anomalous propagators.,0
"If the phonon energies are extracted from experimental data, this phonon renormalization does not matter, since nature already includes all possible phonon-phonon interactions.",0
"The corrections for electronphonon exchange processes naturally include the phonon propagator in the self-energy, and two phonon propagators for the nonlinear coupling.",0
"inclusion of these diagrams result in an Eliashberg spectral function which is dependent of the Matsubara phonon propagator, making the resulting equations untractable.these diagrams since they result in an additional selfenergy term, causing the Eliashberg spectral function to not be writeable in its standard form anymore.",0
"The effective potential does not obtain any new dependence by including the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling, meaning that the Eliashberg equations can be constructed from the Dyson series in the same manner as in the harmonic case.",0
This can only be done by leaving out the momentum dependence of the self-energies and the electron momentum dependence of the matrix elements.,0
"For sake of completeness, we will derive the anisotropic Eliashberg equations first, after which an isotropic approximation can be made.",0
The derivation of the Eliashberg equations approximates the typical phonon energies in the system to bemuch smaller than the Fermi energy.,0
"This can be a valid argument for the phonon term in the equations (i.e. ), however, the Coulomb repulsion present in the anomalous self-energy does not act on the phonon energy scale.",0
"The electron propagator is drawn for clarity, but transparent, because it is not a part of the Debye-Waller self-energy.",0
"The nonlinear Eliashberg function Equation shows that the dimensionless coupling p,kis directly linked to the phonon part of the effective potential, introduced in the self-energies of the electronand anomalous Dyson series.",0
"However, the integration over the Brillouin zone smears out these contributions, once again with the relevant electron-phonon coupling matrix element as weight.",0
C. Analytic continuation The critical temperature of the superconducting system can be determined from the standard Eliashberg equations.,0
"Therefore, it is desired to perform an analytic continuation onthe Eliashberg equations to understand superconducting systems better.",0
It is possible to perform the Matsubara summation after using the spectral representations of the Green s functions in the self-energy expressions.,0
"Even though the equations are unaffected by nonlinearity, the Eliashberg function has a new definition compared to the case without -electron--phonon interactions.",0
"To solve the real-axis equations, the self-energies on the imaginary axis have to be determined first, since they are required as an input in the top line of equations and .",0
It is essential that the branch cut is fixed on the positive real axis for computation of the coupled self-consistent equations.,0
"A general way of obtaining the isotropic equations is through averaging the anisotropic equations over the Fermi surface Zdp (2 )3 p g( F)Z(p, ipm) =Z(ipm) Zdp (2 )3 p g( F)W(p, ipm) =W(ipm).",0
"The only input required for the Eliashberg equations is the Eliashberg spectral function 2F( ), a value for the Coulomb parameter u and its cutoff c.",0
The nonlinear Eliashberg function is given by and is dependent of the linear and nonlinear matrix elements and the spectral function of the free phonon.,0

The main reason for this approximation is the fact that the constant phonon frequency allows us to decouple the matrix elements from the spectral functions.,0
"Therefore, computations using the spectral function can be performed without having done ab initio calculations about the phonon spectrum and the matrix elements.",0
"It is alsoan assumption made by [], where an explicit form of the -electron--phonon matrix element is presented in the dispersionless longitudinal optical phonon approximation with addition of some other approximations.",0
"Instead of a phonon spectrum with delta peaks at the energy of the dispersionless phonons , we take into account broadening of the spectral lines by describing the spectral functions with Lorentzian profiles B( , ) B ( , ), being the typical shape of homogeneously broadened spectral lines.",0
"First, the critical temperature Tcis computed by using the standard Eliashberg equations, coupled for Z and W on the imaginary axis.",0
"Since there is currently no computationally viable method of calculating the full -electron--phonon matrix element (p,k,q), it is yet unsure how large 2 can become for superconductors that display significant signs of anharmonicity.",0
"However, advances in ab initio calculations might give us the ability to compute these nonlinear matrix elements in the near future.",0
"In particular, a recent paper [] reporting a semi-analytical expression of the long-range part of this matrix element where it is linked directly to microscopic quantities of the material.",0
"The critical temperature of the superconductor for a range of 1and 2values with = meV, = meV, c= meV, u = and c= meV ( times the highest phonon energy in the spectrum).",0
"The standard Eliashberg equations have to be solved first, yielding the normalization function Z and selfenergy W on the imaginary axis for a discrete set of points (the Matsubara frequencies).",0
"The real axis gap and normalization function Having computed the solutions of the standard Eliashberg equations, the real-axis equations can be solved.",0
"The real-axis Eliashberg equations and depend on the Eliashberg spectral function in two different ways: through the dimensionless coupling , but also explicitly in the integrations over the real axis.",0
"Through this selfconsistent treatment of the self-energies it appears that the gap function has a maximum value of a few meV, never exceeding the energy of meV.",0
In this paper we constructed the Eliashberg equations using a Hamiltonian which includes the electron-phonon coupling up to second order .,0
Addition of nonlinearity of this form to Migdal-Eliashberg theory does not affect the standard or real-axis description of the Eliashberg equations.,0
This nonlinear and anisotropic expression for the spectral function in combination with the unaltered Eliashberg equations can be seen as the main result of this manuscript.,0
"It is a general result which holds for any material where the phonon energy scale and the Debye-Waller self-energy are negligible compared to the maximum of the electronic band, and where the Migdal approximation is still valid.",0
"If the -electron--phonon matrix element is known and the superconducting properties of this nonlinear material are desired, it is important to check if the Debye-Waller energy is indeed a small quantity, at least compared to the electronic conduction band.",0
Ab initio calculations of the phonon spectra and electron-phonon matrix elements can be difficult with inclusion of nonlinearity.,0
"Recently, a semi-analytical expression to calculate the long-range part of the -electron--phonon matrix ele-ment has been derived [].",0

Appendix A: Calculating the Dyson series This first part of the Appendix will be used to go over the method of constructing the Dyson series used as starting point for setting up the Eliashberg equations.",0
"However, one problem that arises is that the anomalous self-energy will be omitted as well, all the while it is clear from the propagator s Dyson series that it does add contributions.",0
"Appendix B: Anisotropic Eliashberg equations We will go over the derivation of the anisotropic Eliashberg equations, since it is important to be aware of all approximations that have to be made and where they come from.",0
"By splitting the right-hand and lefthand side of the self-consistent equation into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part, they can be split into two separate equations.",0
"Let us assume that the selfenergies Z, andWvary slowly in function of the electronic band energy k=E, at least in comparison with the explicit presence of Ein the fraction.",0
"A physical interpretation for this approximation is the fact that the phonon energies act on a small energy window around the Fermi energy [ F D; F+ D], meaning that the self-energies can simply be evaluated at the Fermi energy.",0
"Therefore, if we assume that the electronic band has a high maximum energy , then it would make no difference if we integrated to this maximum or infinity due to the rapid convergence of the integrand (being on the energy scale of the phonons).",0
"(B11) The limit of + has not been taken yet, doing this would change the inverse tangent functions to constants, simplifying the coupled self-consistent equations in the process.",0
"Contributions of the Debye-Waller diagram The first order S-matrix expansion resulted in a contribution of the Coulomb interaction, but not for the phonons.",0
"The Debye-Waller term can not be written with an effective potential in this way, its contribution will remain an addition to the original self-energy.",0
"The approximation that (E k) ( F k) = kand + relied on the integrand working on the phonon energy scale and the rapid convergence of the integrand in function of E. This is not true for the Debye-Waller contribution, which is independent of the electronic band structure.",0
"Thus, this approximation cannot be made here and the energy integral is simply done over the introduced Dirac delta distributionR dE (E k) = , equaling unity.",0
"(k) works on an energy scale of the phonons, while is the maximum energy of the electronic band, assumed to be much larger.",0
"To construct the Eliashberg equations, one has to start by performing the integrals over energy, introduced in the self-energies S(p) and W(p) analytically.",0
"However, its contribution has to be negligible to in the first place, ultimately leaving the Eliashberg equations unaffected.",0

"In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL).",0
"Taking the pioneering FedAvg algorithm [] as an example, the training process of FL alternates between a local training phase and a global aggregation phase.",0
"In the local training phase, each user, independently, performs multiple stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based optimization steps on its own dataset.",0
"It should be noted that neither random seed agreement-based approaches nor DP-based approaches achieve perfect security due to Shannon s one-time pad encryption theorem [] which states that, in order to fully protect a message with Lindependent symbols (from some finite field), the security key must be uniformly distributed and contains at least Lsymbols.",0
Information-theoretic secure aggregation usually focus on a two-fold optimization of both the upload communication rate RX =PK k=1H(Xk)/H(W1)and the minimum security key sizes necessary to achieve input security.,0
"We present a novel entropic converse proof and derive lower bounds on the achievable communication and key rates for any B K. In particular, we show that RX , RY max{/B,/(K )}, RZ /B andRZ max{, K/B }for any B K. When B K , the derived bounds match the achievable rates so that the optimal rate region can be established.",0
"This consists of a novel key generation scheme and an input aggregation scheme presented in Section V, and a matching converse proof in Section VI.",0
"This yields an achievable rate tuple (,/(K ),/(K ),)given in Theorem where RX, RYandRZ reach their minimal values while RZ= /(K )is within a multiplicative factor of K/(K ) 2to its minimum value6.",0
"We highlight the implications of Theorem as follows: )Communication Efficiency : When B K , the optimal communication rates are given by R Y= /B andR X= which is equivalent to an average upload rate of /Bon each user-to-relay link.",0
"The per-link rates on both hops are inversely proportional to B, revealing a fundamental trade-off between communication efficiency and the association number B. Therefore, Theorem suggests that for FL systems with limited link capacity, the overall aggregation delay can be improved by establishing parallel connection to a larger number of relays.",0
"Theorem also suggests that when B K , the optimal individual key rate R Z= /B is inversely proportional to B. The optimal source key rate R Z = max {, K/B }scales inversely with Band is lower bounded by .",0

We can then assess the uncertainty in the estimated parameters of the regime-switching process by deriving the so-called Fisher-Information matrix (FIM).,0

PACS numbers: I. INTRODUCTION The mass reverse problem of the Roper resonances (N and N) has long been an important topic in hadron physics [].,0
"However, based on the energy relation E= (2n+l), although the energy of N(2S) should be greater than that of N(1P) theoretically, but experiments observed such mass reverse phenomenon.",0
"In addition, due to the heavier mass of constituent strange quark, the state, as the orbital excitation of the baryon ( qqs), should have an energy greater than that ofN(1P), yet the experimental observations also show the opposite measurements.",0
"These mass reverse problems present a significant challenge to the traditional quark model, thus, investigating the internal structure of these particles is crucial for enhancing our understanding of quark model itself, and the non-perturbative effect of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).",0
"Based on a relativized quark model that incorporates confinement and one-gluon exchange (OGE) interactions, S. Capstick and N. Isgur systematically studied the S-wave and P-wave baryons in both light and heavy sectors.",0
"Their results show that although theN, N, and states can be accommodated within the three-quark framework [ ], the energy of N(2S) is still approximately MeV higher than that of N [].",0
"Based on this, they provided a reasonable explanation for the mass inversion problem of the Roper resonances (N and N), although there remains some discrepancy with experimental values [].",0
"In addition, they found that the energy of ( P) is still significantly higher than the experimental value of , which is around GeV.",0
"They concluded that the resulting spectrum is reasonable and in good agreement with the NN phenomenology, especially when the standard one-gluon exchange force is included.",0
"However, in their work, the mass of N(2S) is calculated around GeV, which made it not a suitable candidate for N. Hence, until now, there still no model that can explain N, N, and simultaneously well as experimental observations as traditional baryon states.",0
"[], after using the effective chiral lagrangian at next-to-leading order, the authors already obtained a quasi-bound K -K state, whose mass indicated that it might be a good candidate ofN. Similarly, after considering chiral symmetry, the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation was applied to study the coupling among four physical channels ( N, N,K , and K ), then resonances seemed to be related with N and N were also obtained [].",0
"[] demonstrated that the N channel can also significantly affect the results, after considering this three-body channel, the mass, decay width, and branching ratios of N were in good agreement with experimental measurements, and such conclusion can also be similarly found in Ref.",0
"Under the framework of unitarized coupled-channel chiral perturbation theory [], N could be generated through strong channel couplings, and K -K component was found to be dominant in its wave function, which means conclusions in Refs.",0
"Then, by studying S-wave pion-nucleon scattering within the unitarized chiral effective Lagrangian that includes all possible two-body contact terms, Ref.",0
"Recently, correlation functions have also been used to investigate the mass of N. By fitting the data within a general framework, Ref.",0
"[] predicted the existence of a bound state with isospin I= /, whose mass is just around the region of N. As for , current problems in containg it into traditional baryon spectra also give birth on the idea that if may also be a molecular state.",0
"Thus, to address the problem of Roper resonance, as our first step, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method combined with the Gaussian expansion method (GEM) to study the mass problem of N, N, and in the three-quark as well as five-quark framework.",0

"Since in this work, for five-quark perspective, we focus on their molecular nature, therefore, we first construct the color singlet three-quark and two-quark wave functions.",0
"Then, following the principle of group theory, we couple the three-quark and two-quark wave functions to form the five-quark wave function.",0
"Since isospin is a good quantum number, according to Wigner-Eckart theorem, on the spectrum side we will only consider the case where the third component of isospin is Iz= , which gives that B1 , = (udu duu), B2 , = (2uud udu duu).",0
"Here, the wave function B1 , 2is the flavor-antisymmetric wave function, and B2 , 2is the flavor-symmetric wave function.",0
"The corresponding flavor wave functions for these structures are as follows P1 , = (uds su dus su), P2 , = (2uus sd uds su dus su).",0
"In the threequark framework, considering the explicitly breaking of SU symmetry, its flavor wave function only has flavorantisymmetric part as B3 ,= (uds dus).",0
"For each relative motion, the radial wave function is expanded through the Gaussian-Expansion Method (GEM), in which each radial wave function is given by nlm(r) =Nnlrle nr2Ylm(r), with Nnlbeing the normalization constants as Nnl="" 2l+(2 n)l+ (2l+ )# .",0
"For the five-quark molecular states, we can regard the system as a coupling of the orbital wave functions of a three-quark cluster and a two-quark cluster.",0
"Since in this work, for the three-quark system, we only consider S-wave and P-wave wave functions, and for the five-quark system, we only consider the S-wave case, thus, all the coupling coefficient between the orbital wave functions is equal to .",0
"former is labeled as B1 , corresponding to the antisymmetric relation between particles and , while the latter is labeled as B2 , corresponding to the symmetric relation between particles and .",0
"Considering the third component of spin, the three-quark spin wave function with quantum number1 2has a total of four wave functions, which are B1 , = ( ), B1 , = ( ), B2 , = (2 ), B2 , = ( + 2 ).",0
"All of them are symmetric with respect to particles and , whose explicit expressions are as follows B3 , = , B3 , = ( + + ), B3 , = ( + + ), B3 , = .",0
This can be interpreted as the coupling between a three-quark spin wave function with S= 2orS= 2and a two-quark system with spin S= or S= .,0
"Based on the previous discussion on the three-quark spin wave functions, the spin wave function for the three-quark system with spin1 2can be either symmetric or antisymmetric.",0
"This wave function can couple with both S= and S= to produce the total five-quark spin wave function with spin1 , denoted as Pi , .",0
"Then, under molecular state configuration, the color wave function of the five-quark system can be viewed as the coupling of the color wave functions of the threequark system and the two-quark system.",0
"By solving the Schrodinger equation in the complex plane, both energy and width (i.e., the decay rate of the resonance) information of resonant states can be simultaneously obtained.",0
"In the complex-scaling representation, energy Mis plotted along the horizontal axis, and the half-width / is plotted along the vertical axis.",0
"RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS After all the preparation above, in this section, we aim to investigate the mass inverse problems between N and N, as well as N and , from both the three-quark and five-quark perspectives.",0
"As we have mentioned in the introduction, for traditional baryon configuration on N states, experimental results give that the second N(/+) state, identified as N, is located around GeV, and the firstN(/ ) state has a mass near MeV.",0
"However, our calculation gives a mass of MeV for the N(2S) state, which does not correspond to the experimental N but is closer to the experimental N state, who has a mass between and MeV.",0
"The energy ofN(1P) in our calculation is MeV, which is very closed to the experimental N. TABLE III: Results of the hadron spectrum calculation.",0
"In fact, in the earlier time, many calculations on the bare three-quark state for N(2S) already predicted that its masses should be above GeV, for example, Refs.",0
"[], the authors included ad-hoc mass shifts for the N(/ ) andN(/+) states, while Glozman et al. introduced Goldstone-boson exchange (GBE) interactions in Ref.",0
[] successfully reduced the energy of N(2S) to MeV and that of N(1P) to MeV by introducing pseudo-scalar meson exchange in the context of OGE potential.,0
"While these approaches address the issue of the Roper resonance mass inversion effectively, they still have some issues with other states.",0
"Actually, from the experimental results of light mesons, we may do a simple estimation on the bare masses of N(1P) and N(2S).",0
"When we look at PDG [], it is easy to see that the average mass difference between the S-1Sstates of , , and is about MeV, while the mass differ-ence for the P-1Sstates is approximately MeV.",0
"However, if we consider N as the first radial excitation of N, the mass difference S-1Sis only MeV, which is significantly smaller than the S-1S mass difference of mesons, while the mass difference between ( N) and the ground-state N is closer to the meson S-1Smass difference.",0
"Therefore, we conclude that in the image of quenched quark model, the N(2S) state is unlikely to correspond to the experimental N, but rather to the experimental N. And such opinion that N(2S) state may not be the experimental N is also supported by the recent lattice QCD calculations [].",0
"Here, the mass difference between N(1P) and N(1S) is MeV, which is closer but slightly larger than the meson P-1Smass difference of MeV.",0
"Similarly, for the family, if we treat as the first orbital excitation of qqsstate, then its mass difference from ( S) will also be much smaller than the average mass difference between the P-1Sstates of , , ,K, and K mesons as approximately MeV.",0
"However, this mass difference on mesons is consistent with the mass difference between ( P) and ( S) in our calculations.",0
"Therefore, we propose that the experimental is likely to be the first orbital excitation of the baryon, while can not be a pure traditional baryon that contains three compositeness quarks.",0
"B. Five-Quark Calculation After studying the three-quark nature of Roper resonances, in this subsection, we perform a five-quark component discussion on N and based on the model parameters from fitted hadron mass spectrum.",0
"For N, although its mass may be around the threshold ofN , itself is so special in hadron physics that we generally do not consider coupled channels that include it.",0
"Ethmeans the threshold of corresponding channel, Escis the energy of every single channel, Emixis the lowest energy of the system by coupling all channels.",0
"Finally, after performing channel coupling for all channels, the calculation results show that the lowest energy is MeV, which is still above the threshold of MeV, as listed in the fifth column of Table IV.",0
"Among these, the N Kand channels are bound states, whose masses can correspond to the experimental states of and , respectively.",0
"Additionally, the and channels also have bound states, with potentially being a candidate for the experimental state of .",0

"we also obtain three resonance states, one is R1/, with Kas its dominant component, making it a promising candidate for the experimental N. Another is R1/, with K as its primary component.",0
", panel (a) presents the decay width of the resonance state R1/ to K, which is around MeV. As a candidate for N, it is obvious that this width is much smaller than the experimental width forN. This discrepancy arises because the main decay channel for N in experiments is N , which predominantly consists with the quark component qqqqq, differing from our quark component qqssq, and thus theN decay channel is not included in our calculation.",0

"Considering the energy positions of these states and their relations to the nearest threshold channels, the main components of these states are as follows, B is dominated by ,R0 is by N K ,R0 is by , andR0 is by .",0
"This is because the coupling between N Kand is strong enough to lower the energy of the channel by nearly MeV, which in turn raises the energy ofN K, turning it into a scattering state, as shown in Fig.",0

Han Reddio Abstract The increasing adoption of blockchain technology has led to a growing demand for higher transaction throughput.,0
"Traditional blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, execute transactions sequentially within each block, limiting scalability.",0
"I NTRODUCTION Blockchain technology first gained prominence with Bitcoin [], a decentralized cryptocurrency that operates without a central authority.",0
"Additionally, Ethereum employs a computationally intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism [], further constraining scalability.",0
"As blockchain adoption grows, overcoming these execution and consensus bottlenecks is critical for improving performance.",0
"With advancements in consensus protocols [, ], blockchain performance bottlenecks are shifting from consensus mechanisms to smart contract execution.",0
"In OCC, transactions are executed in parallel without dependency enforcement, and after execution, a validation phase detects conflicts.",0
"Since all parallel execution models rely on the same underlying state database, storage access remains a major limiting factor.",0
"As blockchain systems scale to millions of accounts and contracts, addressing storage inefficiencies becomes crucial to unlocking the full potential of parallel execution.",0
"In this paper, we propose Reddio, a batch-based parallel transaction execution framework that effectively addresses both computational and storage bottlenecks in modern blockchain systems.",0
"To address this, Reddio introduces an asynchronous state database that decouples execution from storage operations, allowing storage updates to be processed efficiently without blocking transaction execution.",0
"To achieve high-performance execution, Reddio integrates three key techniques into the storage layer: Direct state reading: Instead of traversing the Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) for each state access, Reddio allows the EVM to retrieve state values directly from a keyvalue database, significantly reducing read latency and minimizing I/O amplification.",0
"By integrating batch-based execution with an asynchronous state database, Reddio effectively maximizes parallel execution efficiency while addressing the storage limitations that traditionally hinder blockchain performance.",0
Section II provides background information and motivates the need for parallel transaction execution in blockchain systems.,0
"Ablockchain is a shared and distributed ledger consisting of a chain of blocks , maintained by a decentralized network of nodes.",0
"Ethereum [] is the most widely used blockchain supporting smart contracts, written in Solidity [] and compiled into bytecode for execution on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).",0
"When a contract function is executed, its current state is retrieved from the blockchain, updated, and stored back upon completion.",0
"In a typical blockchain system, full nodes synchronize and execute all transactions within blocks, updating the ledger state, which consists of key-value pairs.",0
"When a state with key is requested, a full node provides the value and a proof consisting of all traversed nodes from the root to the corresponding leaf.",0
"Ethereum s state database maintains all account states using a hierarchical Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) structure for efficient storage, verification, and updates, as illustrated in Fig. .",0
"At the top level, the account trie stores all blockchain accounts, with each account identified by the Keccakhash of its address.",0
"During the update phase, the EVM reads and writes state values to the tries in state database for transaction execution.",0
"Once all transactions are processed, the state database recalculates the new root hash by recomputing hashes for all dirty nodes in account trie or storage tries those modified during execution.",0
"Finally, in the store phase, all dirty nodes are persisted to a underlying key-value database (e.g., LevelDB in current Ethereum).",0
", T m is appended successfully, nodes execute the transactions in the block, following the order specified in Bl, to update the blockchain state.",0
"This serial scheme ensures all nodes reach the consistent blockchain state after execution in current Ethereum, which is critical to the security of it.",0
"A direct solution is to leverage the multiple cores available to execute multiple transactions in parallel, which is well-studied in databases [, ].",0
"The parallel executions in blockchain should additionally meet the deterministic serializability criteria , as defined in Definition , which promises that all nodes obtain the same result for every block.",0
"This is mainly due to the lack of inherent parallelism on the real-world workloads many frequently accessed shared variables force transactions to be executed sequentially, on a few critical paths.",0
"As transaction volume grows, this sequential model becomes a major bottleneck, restricting blockchain throughput and increasing transaction confirmation times.",0
"With advancements in consensus mechanisms, transaction execution has gradually emerged as the primary performance bottleneck in modern blockchain systems.",0
"While consensus algorithms have improved significantly, reducing block propagation delays and finalization times, the efficiency of transaction execution remains a limiting factor.",0
"Without optimizing execution, the overall system cannot fully utilize the benefits of faster consensus, ultimately constraining blockchain scalability.",0
"Furthermore, the synchronous workflow of the state database constrains the potential benefits of other optimizations (Fig. ).",0
"To address these challenges, optimizing both transaction execution and state management is essential for improving blockchain s scalability.",0
"A parallel execution framework that efficiently handles independent transactions while mitigating state access bottlenecks can significantly enhance blockchain performance, enabling higher throughput and lower latency without compromising consensus guarantees.",0
"This compatibility also ensures that Reddio retains Ethereum s account model and state database structure, where account data and contract states are managed as multiple Merkle Patricia Tries (MPTs) as demonstrated in Fig. .",0
"To overcome the performance bottlenecks in Ethereum s current transaction execution scheme, Reddio introduces two core techniques: parallel EVM execution and asynchronous state database .",0
"After each batch completes, the coordinator resolves dependencies among transactions and merges execution outcomes into a new global state database, ensuring deterministic serializability.",0
"Second, Reddio utilizes anasynchronous state database to mitigate I/O bottlenecks, as discussed in Section II-D. Instead of synchronously updating the state database during execution, Reddio decouples execution from storage operations, allowing transactions to execute independently while state updates are applied asynchronously.",0
"To facilitate transaction execution on the EVM, every transaction in a batch operates on a lightweight copy of the global state database.",0
"The coordinator then commits the remaining transactions and merges their state database copies into a new global state database, providing an updated snapshot for the next execution round.",0
"As discussed in Section II-D, read and write operations to the state database contribute over % of total execution overhead due to the significant I/O amplification caused by MPTs.",0
"To address this limitation, Reddio enhances the state database by introducing direct state reading ,asynchronous node retrieval , and a pipelined workflow .",0
"First, in the current state database, when execution requests a state value, it must locate the root hash of the corresponding trie and traverse the trie to retrieve the value.",0
"After each batch execution, Reddio selectively rehashes and persists certain nodes in the account trie and storage tries to the underlying key-value database (e.g., LevelDB), forming a pipeline between execution and state persistence.",0
"D ESIGN A. Batch-based Optimistic Parallel Execution As previously discussed, Reddio adopts a batch-based optimistic parallel execution scheme, where each transaction executes independently on a copy of the global state database without any cross-thread communication.",0
"Once obtains the batch Tbatch of transactions, the coordinator schedules the parallel execution of them, as illustrated in Algorithm .",0
"It takes the transaction batchTbatch , a global state database S, and the set of remained transactions Tas input and returns a new global state database after executing transactions, and a set of state updates W written by successfully committed transactions.",0
"Otherwise, the transaction is committed, and the coordinator merges its state updates into the new state database Smerge (Lines -).",0
"B. Asynchronous State Database While parallel execution improves computation, storage access remains a major bottleneck due to its inherently sequential nature.",0

"As the state database scales to millions of accounts, execution is no longer the primary limiting factor storage latency dominates, restricting overall speedup.",0
"To this end, Reddio introduces three key optimizations: direct state reading ,asynchronous node retrieval , and pipelined workflow , as detailed later in this subsection.",0
"During transaction execution, the EVM does not require state proofs, yet conventional state databases still traverse all nodes from the root to the leaf for each read operation, whether in the account trie or storage trie, as described in Section II-B.",0
"To reduce this overhead, Reddio enables the EVM to retrieve state values directly from a separate key-value database Ddirect with a single read operation.",0
"Similarly, for each state entry of a smart contract account Awith value v, the state database stores A|| , v , where || denotes concatenation.",0
"Three global data structures are shared across algorithms in this paper: the state database S, the memory state cache Cstate, and a queue Qret.",0
"While direct state reading improves retrieval efficiency by bypassing MPT traversals, it introduces the challenge of maintaining consistency between the fast-access state database and the MPT structure, especially during state updates or recovery from unexpected crashes.",0
"To further accelerate this process, Reddio leverages the concurrent reading capabilities of key-value databases, such as LevelDB.",0
The retrieval threads then continuously dequeue tasks from Qretand concurrently fetch the corresponding MPT nodes from the underlying node database.,0
This function loads nodes from an MPT (either the account trie or a storage trie) stored in the underlying key-value database.,0
"The load_Nodes() functionAlgorithm : Asynchronous node retrieval Global : State database S, memory node cache Cnode, retrieval task queue Qret // Run continuously on a separate thread 1while true do o= A, , v Qret.",0
"Since the underlying keyvalue database supports concurrent reads, multiple retrieval threads can significantly improve performance by parallelizing state access.",0
"As discussed in Section II-D, the synchronous workflow of the state database significantly limits the benefits of parallel execution.",0
"When a state is modified, all nodes along its search path must be updated, rehashed, and then persisted in the key-value database.",0
"Since hashing depends on updated node values and storage depends on finalized hashes, these dependencies force a strict execution order, preventing concurrent processing and introducing performance bottlenecks.",0

"If not, Reddio speculatively rehashes and persists the Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) of A s storage into the node database.",0
"Reddio employs two additional threads to handle the hash and store phases in parallel, while the update phase is triggered by the commit thread, as described in Algorithm .",0
"Finally, the StoreThread ()serializes the nodes dequeued from Qstore and writes them into the node database Dnode (Lines -).",0
"C. Framework In this subsection, we present the overall framework of Reddio s parallel EVM execution with asynchronous storage, as illustrated in Algorithm .",0
"Afterward, the coordinator invokes AsynCommitAccount () to trigger the pipelined workflow of the account trie as defined in Algorithm .",0
"V. A NALYSIS A. Correctness To investigate the correctness of the Reddio s protocol, we show that it meets the deterministic serializability criteria, given in Theorem .",0

"When r= 4andu , the probability of no further modifications, Pr[X4= |] , is approximately %, which is sufficiently high.",0
"C. Recovery To support direct state reading, Reddio records state values in the database Ddirect in the form A|| , v during the store phase of each state update.",0
"In this paper, we proposed Reddio, a batch-based parallel transaction execution framework that optimizes both computation and storage efficiency in blockchain systems.",0
"In future work, we plan to explore adaptive transaction scheduling and enhanced state caching mechanisms to further improve blockchain scalability.",0

"To design the optimal baseband waveform with these characteristics, we define and solve an optimization problem for power-efficient deceptive wireless beamforming (DWB) .",0
We assume wireless communication signals employing the ubiquitous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme.,0
"Notation: Vectors are denoted by bold lower case letters, e.g. , and matrices with capital bold letters A. The set of complex, k-vectors, are denoted by Ck, while complex m nmatrices belong in the set Cm n.0denotes the zero matrix, while Idenotes the Identity matrix.",0
"Note that implies a linear constraint since it forces the signal to be transmitted to a specific spatial direction for each receiver, while the information from the other receivers does not interfere towards this direction.",0
"[FH]n, = Lej2 n /L= Lej2 nf /fs, , n L. Recall that in OFDM the subcarriers f are placed at orthogonal IDFT frequencies and so the last equation implies f = f= fs/L.",0
"To study this channel let us use the block of OFDM samples didefined in , that with the addition of the CP, it becomes d i. This LTI channel can be written in matrix form as yi=Hid i+n=Hcirc idi+n(Hcirc iis the circulant channel matrix).",0
The vector of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) samples is nwith a covariance matrix Rn= 2I.Hcirc iis the channel matrix in the time domain which is circulant because the cyclic prefix (CP) was used.,0
2In the general case when time variations introduce significant Doppler within an OFDM symbol and this matrix is not diagonal.matrix for receiver iwhich means that its -th diagonal element is multiplied by the -th QAM symbol xi[ ].,0
"Thus, the -th diagonal element of this matrix for the i-the receiver, and the vectorized version of the matrix are given by: [ Hi] , = i, exp( j2 fRi c) exp( j2 fDimTL).",0
"E AVESDROPPER DECEPTION A. Eavesdropper Speed and Range Estimation To understand how eavesdroppers are deceived, we must first understand the algorithms that they use to calculate range and Doppler from OFDM signals.",0
"The basic algorithms for passive RADAR functionality from OFDM signals were presented in earlier works [], [], while the scenario of unknown symbols at the eavesdropper was explored in [].",0
For this part of the algorithm the eavesdropper can use a subset of symbols in a transmitted wireless frame that correspond to known preambles (these are easy to detect sequences at the start of a wireless frame).,0
This is a very viable option since wireless communication is carried out with wireless standards that specify preamble structure and contents.,0
"The OFDM-based passive RADAR algorithm at the eavesdropper performs 2D DFT on the L Mmatrix Ziacross the , m indexes with sampling periods fandTL(essentially sampling ) respectively, to obtain the range-Doppler response contained in Hrd i. From we see that the peak in this range-Doppler response will occur at positions Ri/cand fDi.",0
"This signal must deceive the algorithm that eavesdroppers use for range and Doppler estimation, as was previously described.",0
"Hence, we propose that the emitted signal be: de,i=FH Hspxe,i, where Hspis the diagonal deceiving channel matrix andxe,i can be any random group of QAM symbols destined for the i-th eavesdropper.",0
"This means that if we run the optimization problem at successive groups of Lsymbols each, we will change the term exp(j2 fspmTL)according to the OFDM index m. This was also seen in .",0
"The matrix Xe, which consists of the individual xe,ifor each eavesdropper, is an optimization variable because the QAM symbols can be any random but valid combination.",0

B. Computational consequences The connection between momentum and charge conservation is well known in the computational science of the Vlasov equation.,0
"Alternatively, enforcing momentum conversation in the GEMPIC context, i.e., using nite element exterior calculus, can be achieved by incorporating Dirac constraint theory (see e.g., [ ,]).",0

"In active matter, such as the Vicsek Model of flocking, particles possesses an internal degree of freedom, such as their director, which is subject to interaction with other particles, provided they are within a certain range.",0
"In an effort to understand better the interplay between spatial and internal degrees of freedom, we study numerically a variation of the q= Potts Model on and off the lattice, where particles are additionally subject to Brownian motion.",0
"What makes the question so relevant and interesting is that no such ordered state can exist in equilibrium either on nor off the lattice, because of the Mermin-Wagner theorem (Mermin and Wagner, ) and extensions to it (Tasaki, ), which imply that in equilibrium no long-range order exists in two dimensions between continuous degrees of freedom subject to short-ranged interaction.",0
"The order observed consistently in the Vicsek Model (Vicsek et al. , ) appears to be an oddity, even when allowed by its non-equilibrium nature which protects it from the spell of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.",0
"Further, as particles are not self-propelled, but purely diffusive, there is no feedback of the internal state, i.e.the spin orientation, to the movement of the particle.",0
"As a result the stochastic equations of motion are not expected to carry an advection term as, say, the Toner-Tu equations do (Toner and Tu, ).",0
"Forces are not reciprocal: Particles move freely, even when their interaction makes them align with their neighbourhood.",0
"This lack of mechanical consistency would allow for infinite energy extraction whereby particles are subject to an alignment force when they are close, can be separated without performing work, then flipped without work and re-align once brought close together again.",0
"The non-equilibrium nature of the setup can also be observed in the following Gedankenexperiment : If there is no mechanical feedback of the spin orientation to the movement of particles, their trajectories approaching each other are indistinguishable from their trajectories departing from each other.",0
"As particles align as they get close, they typically depart aligned, so that the reverse trajectory is clearly less likely, breaking time-reversal symmetry.",0
"In equilibrium, the same construction cannot be made, because particles attract each other as they are aligned and separate (more easily) once misaligned, boosting the frequency with which misaligned particles are seen departing each other.",0
"As this model was inspired by the Vicsek Model (Vicsek et al. , ), particles, equipped with a spin, self-propel according to their spin orientation.",0
"Although observed only in the particle density as the control parameter, Solon et al. s setup displays in two dimensions the standard Ising phase transition.",0
"On the one hand, it mediates the interaction between nearest neighbouring sites, as particles with aligned spins invade neighbouring sites and win them over .",0
"On the other hand, the diffusion also results in a loss of local magnetisation as particles leave their aligned neighbourhoods.",0
"Again, there is no spatial force acting on the particles as their motion is unaffected by the state of mutual alignment, but there is an alignment force acting dependingon their proximity, which is being accounted for by heatbath (Glauber) dynamics.",0

"When this number varies, i.e.it is configuration-dependent, it cannot be absorbed by the normalisation of the probability, as would happen in a Boltzmann factor.",0
"The shift would indeed enter in an equilibrium version of the present model, lowering the energy in the Potts model by Jq/ and therefore favouring configurations with many interaction partners, similar to the vision cone model by Loos et al. , is non-equilibrium for being non-reciprocal.",0

"If the particles positions xiwere fixed, the ( |xi xj|/r0) could be cast in a fixed interaction matrix and the update scheme described above is the well-known heat-bath dynamics (Krauth, ) that locally thermalises every spin, producing equilibrium probability exp( J TH).",0
"Because xisample a uniform spatial distribution in [, L), random sequential or deterministically sequential updates, whereby particles are visited in a fixed sequence, are not expected to make a noticeable difference.",0
"The dynamics described above is generically far-fromequilibrium, because of the non-reciprocal way spatial and spin degrees-of-freedom are coupled: If they are close enough, spins effectively feel a force as far as their spinvariable is concerned, but they do not feel a force asfar as their displacement is concerned, no matter whether their spins are aligned or not.",0
"By using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, the computation time is reduced to order MlogM(Newman and Barkema, ).",0
the diffusion of the particles seems to spoil the ordering and formation of clusters of particles with the same spin orientation.,0
"When a well-mixed system in ddimensions shows this behaviour at constant particle density, this translates to |m| L d/. On the other hand, at d= the standard Ising Model displays mean-field scaling |m| L N /4with additional logarithmic corrections ignored.",0

"In the present work, we consider it as the particle density fluctuation about a fixed background, so that does not need to have the same sign throughout the system.",0
"We believe that the off-lattice particle model of Section II.A can be thought of as Model C, with standard Ising static exponents and z= .",0

"The droplet picture The droplet picture in (Woo et al. , ), Section II.A., suggests that ordered Potts (or Ising) clusters in the off-lattice model dissolve as oriented particles leave them by diffusion.",0
"The hypothesis of diffusion-mediated interaction may best be tested in the dilute limit, where particles interact primarily in a delayed fashion by diffusing into each other, as opposed to the dense limit, where particles are interacting directly and immediately as they are packed into dense clusters with excitations capable of sweeping the vast majority of the system.",0

"Such hybrid HJ-aggregation and the pre valent structural disorder in an IDTBT thin -film bring about a mixed origin of lower -energy emission transitions from both intrachain and interchain excitons, e.g. judged by the clearly enhanced vibronic emission peak intensity in the room temperature thin-film spectrum relative to the corresponding solution emission spectrum (Fig.",0
"We propose to tie these similar spectral peak ratios to the thermal accessibility of all electronic density of states (DOS) at temperatures between K and ~ K, which then allows an estimate of the energy barrier for thermal access to the tail states of excitonic DOS to be K = meV in IDTBT thin -film.",0

A linear dependence of the solution TA signal is seen at early time, and a non -linear dependence at longer time due to the occurrence and increasing dominance of nonlinear exciton -exciton annihilation with higher fluences.",0
"IDTBT thin films, on the other hand, exhibit a strong nonlinear dependence of the room -temperature TA signal at all plotted delay times whe n the pulse energy exceeds ~ nJ ( a nJ pulse corresponds to ~ photon/cm3) because in this case, IDTBT backbones in the solid state are close packed into an HJaggregated polymer network, in which the interchain excitonic species and ultrafast EE A kinetics dominate the TA responses.",0

"Page As a result, differentiating the patterns of PP7 signals provides a simple method to experimentally distinguish between the annihilation -limited ( f = ) and the diffusion -limited ( f > ) regime.",0
"The f parameter obtained from fits of the thin -film 7th order data, however, remains constant at over the whole temperature range from K down to K. This suggests that the annihilation -limited regime relies on the microscopic chain -chain contact pattern and weak interchain coupling in IDTBT thin films , rather than quantum interference induced suppression of EEA proposed to arise from stronger interchain interactions in H-aggregated molecular micro -crystals a t cryogenic temperatures .",0
"5b , an Arrhenius fit of the temperature -dependent photocurrent data for T K gives a thermal activation energy barrier for interchain hopping of Ea = meV, which is among the lowest for device relevant continuous organic semiconductor films (Fig.",0
"This suggests that a structural reconfiguration is required for a successful exciton interchain hopping event, the thermal energy at lower temperatures is no longer able to surmount the potential energy barrier associated with structural rearrangement and/or energy disorder.",0

"An act ivation energy for photocurrent generation is not surprising as a Coulomb barrier must be surmounted to separate the charges ( , ).",0
"If this is the case, it may indicate that the EEA process and excitonic int eractions in IDTBT copolymer also involves a charge transfer character followed by rapid energy and structural relaxation leading to formation of the ground state.",0
"The activation energy for EEA could also, then, be the underlying reason for the annihilation probability being significantly less than unity in IDTBT thin films.",0
"The calculated density of the chain -chain crossing points mediated by polymer chain self -assembly are substantial , while the calculated interchain electronic coupling s range from eV up to eV, which are also in the range of the Stokes shift and energy disorder identified in the pristine IDTBT thin -film from this work.",0
As noted above the activation energy governing the exciton interchain hopping and the two -exciton EEA dynamics may arise from a structural reorganization that inhibits recombin ation of travelling excitons ( ).,0
"This is enabled by the annihilation -limited transport regime, and the low site -energy fluctuations together with the ultra-long persistence length measured for IDTBT chains ( ).",0
A narrow distribution (in accord with the small energy disorder) of the excitonic DOS should enable a lar ge migration mobility along the planar backbones and also a high density of available sites for subsequent interchain hops.,0

And it is this limitation what forces us to expand our explorations into deeper directions down the path of multivariability.,0
"This forces us to narrow the scope and the methods in order to reach in a bike, by capillarity, areas of the forest that we could not explore with a car.",0
In order to 1My professor of algebraic topology (F. J. Turiel) introduced us homology in the following way Homotopy is nice.,0
The main one of these venues is directly related and linked to a family of polynomials connected with counting descent statistics on permutations.,0
"In particular, several tricks and numerical experiments are needed in order to come up with proofs of actual improvement when the amount of variables increases.",0
"Later, in order to perform other comparisons with different techniques, we have to deal with problems related to higher order asymptotic expansions and equations, polynomial stability and numeric stability (which we remark here that are completely different topics in spite of their similar names!).",0
This encourages us to propose in Chapter a program aimed at developing a full theoretical framework connecting our real algebraic geometric tools with explorations in combinatorics through numerical lenses.,0
"First and foremost, the relaxation was initially conceived as a way to attack the GLC, which is a central question in convex or conic optimization whose ultimate objects belong to the realm of real algebraic geometry.",0
The relaxation is at the same time a linear object that is built over a moment matrix through linear maps emerging from the series expansion of extensions to power series of the log function.,0
"(RAG and optimization) .The relaxation originally emerged as a way to attack the GLC, which sits at the juncture of convex real alCHAPTER .",0
"Beyond these, when we try to extend the relaxation in order increase the information it can carry, we have to deal with trace inequalities that ultimately suggest an unexplored path into non-commutative algebra.",0
.Our attempts to amplify the reach of the LMP of the relaxation involve dealing with several trace inequalities that hint at a connection with noncommutative algebra and trace algebras.,0
"In our case, we decide to explore the well-known Eulerian polynomials, which connect us and our explorations with the combinatorial setting of the theory of statistics on permutations.",0
definition we use for Eulerian polynomials connects us directly with the combinatorial setting through its relation to counting descent (top) statistics on permutations.,0
"This analytic framework could become even more relevant if we had decided to investigate the relation between these roots and the statistics of coefficients of polynomials, where deep connections between algebra, probability, analysis and statistics arise while trying to transport information from the coefficients to the roots and the other way around.",0
This also allowed us to study how that symmetry can give us back some information about the underlying combinatorial object through the path that connects these polynomials to statistics on permutations.,0
"In the definition of the relaxation, it will suffice to understand linear matrix polynomials, matrix inequalities CHAPTER .",0
"Some convex real algebraic geometry will be helpful, but it is enough with a superficial knowledge of the areas around the GLC.",0
The part about Eulerian polynomials requires some understanding of the combinatorics around statistics of permutations over order sets.,0
Some numerical linear algebra will be helpful to understand the numerical stability problems and the attempts at approximating generalized eigenvectors.,0
"Finally, for the last part, a light understanding of polynomial patterns paired together with some additional knowledge about statistics on permutations should do the job.",0
"L p,efor any integer e d:=deg(p)to all the entries of any MMM of the form given by Equation for any RZ polynomial p RRZ[x]produces a PSD matrix.",0
"On Part III, the comparisons between bounds begin and therefore we center our attention in theorems about asymptotic expansions and differences.",0
"Then we have the bounds r n> vT nRn,0vn vTnRn,totvn, where r ={rn} n=0is the sequence of the largest roots of the polynomials in A w. Theorem .",0
"The combination of these results, their proofs, the whole story we tell here and the spirit of the general ideas that guide our research puts us at the end of this work in the position to propose the Mindelsee Program in the conclusion.",0
Motivation for the necessity and usability of a relaxation The next question motivates why we search for matrix relaxations of RCSs.,0
Defining the relaxation Our relaxation has the form of a LMP whose initial matrix is PSD and whose entries are defined in terms of values of the L-form on monomials of degree up to three.,0
"RELAXATION OF RIGIDLY CONVEX SETS In particular, the relaxation is built over the simplest matrix mold that contains all the variables.",0
This matrix is the mold given by the symmetric moment matrix indexed (multiplicatively) by all the monomials in the variables xup to degree .,0
"We call the linear matrix polynomial Mp,d:=A0+n i=1xiAi thepencil associated to p with respect to the virtual degree d and Sd(p):={a Rn|Mp,d(a)is PSD } thespectrahedron associated to p with respect to the virtual degree d .",0
"Fix d N0and let p R[[x]]be a power series with p =0and consider the (extended) orthogonal (block) matrix U:=diag(,U)with the block U Rn northogonal.",0
We can meaningfully increase the number of variables of our polynomial or we can extend the amount of monomials used in the mold matrix.,0
"Thus, in the scenario where pis RZ (which implies that pitself is so) the relaxation automatically gives another determinantal representation and a cofactor respecting the original RCS of pas long as its initial matrix verifies that its determinant is nonzero.",0
"p R[x] admits a RZ perfection which admits a determinantal representation whose initial matrix is PD, then the relaxation is exact and it produces a cofactor respecting the original RCS.",0
"=tr(A1A2A2A1)in general and therefore, without access to the determinantal representation, it is not clear what should the value of Lp(x2 1x2 )be in order to capture that product of traces into the matrix defining the relaxation.",0
"However, applying Burnside s theorem on matrix algebras (this is a well-known result widely used in many subfields of linear algebra, see its proof in different environments, e.g., in [Sha14],[LR04],[Fre23],[HJ12] or [ 73]), we know that two generic symmetric matrices A,B Symd(R)generate the whole matrix algebraRd d.",0
"Thus, the generic pwill have its matrices A1and A2generating the whole matrix algebra and therefore taking the symmetric matrices generated by A1and A2would give Symd(R).",0
This problem comes in the form of an obstruction for the general initial moment matrix generated when we expand too much the number of monomials considered.,0
"general, the main obstruction we will encounter is that the initial matrix of the relaxation stops being in general PSD when we consider more monomials.",0
"Of course, this initial matrix can be made PSD if we artificially multiply by some polynomials that we know that have PSD initial matrices.",0
This artificial construction does not accomplish what we want because we want to look at matrix molds and not at arbitrary factors that do not actually help in the fundamental task of increasing the amount of information about the polynomial carried by the relaxation.,0
"Chapter Limitations of Immediate Matrix Extensions Building on what we saw in the previous chapter, we study the main obstruction encountered when we try to extend the relaxation: the initial matrix should be PSD.",0
"LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS nand Ai,ui,u ispecified in each circumstance so there is no possible confusion.",0
The generality we require for this is the reason why we set our notation to be able to speak easily about entrywise applications of functions to the elements inside a matrix.,0
"We denote the subtensor of order k sobtained from fixing s indices in positions (j1< <js)to the respective numbers (ij1, . .",0
Now we can easily define the map in (the entries of) a -tensor that gives the relaxation in [Sch23] as we have the notation necessary to manipulate elements entrywise and to refer to subtensors obtained by fixing some indices.,0
"In particular, the relaxation in [Sch23, Definition ] is constructed fixing Athe obvious mold moment symmetric -tensor built through taking the outer power of the vector (,x1, . .",0
"[Sch23, Theorem ] shows that in fact this condition is fulfilled in this case whenever we take L=Lp,ewith p R[x] an RZ polynomial with e deg(p).",0
"Each moment matrix in the next section that is supposed to be the initial matrix (at the origin) of an LMP generated by applying Lp,eentrywise will be called a mold moment matrix (orMMM , for short).",0
LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS There are of course very different possibilities of structures of MMMs that lead us to the objective of collecting the information given by the coefficients of the monomials of higher degree.,0
Trace inequalities matter We begin with a lemma about an inequality between the two different traces of products of four matrices that are pairwise equal that will be useful in the proof of Proposition ..,0
"Then there are just two possible traces of -products formed by two copies of each matrix and these are given by tr(A2B2) tr(ABAB ), which gives equality if and only if A and B commute.",0
"LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS considered in [Sch23, Corollary ] because they do not behave as nice as the monomials of degree up to .",0
"tr(u2 1A4 +2u1u2A3 1A2+ 6u2 2A2 1A2 + 6u2 2A1A2A1A2) tr(u2 1A4 +2u1u2A3 1A2+u2 2A1A2A1A2) = tr(A1(u1A1+u2A2)A1(u1A1+u2A2)), which finishes the proof of our result.",0
"+A1K )), where we denoted K=u1A1+u2A2and K =u 1A1+u 2A2and used the facts that e dand several identities between traces of the products of up to real symmetric matrices that let us conclude the previous chain of (in)equalities in terms of traces that completes the proof of this lemma.",0
"This is so because the lemma is stated for the case of two variables, where the Helton-Vinnikov theorem is available and therefore we know that we can always write r(x1,x2) =det(Id+A1x1+A2x2), where we can suppose that A1is diagonal by a trivial orthogonal diagonalization argument.",0
"For the importance of experiments of this type in order to determine probabilities in trace inequalities, we refer the reader to the work of Greene in [Gre14] and the master s theses of his students [Sch15; Hua09].",0
in general although our random experiments indicate that when A1is diagonal and Kand K are real symmetric tr ((Id+K+A1K ))> happens quite often.,0
"It turns out that this MMM produces PSD matrices for the independent term, i.e., the matrices obtained by applying Lp,eto all the entries of the matrix in Equation above for any RZ polynomial p R[x]and e deg(p)are all PSD.",0
"We remember that because of classical results it is enough to show that the biggest possible matrix described in Equation , i.e., the one with k =n=m, is PSD as we know that if a matrix is PSD then each principal submatrix of it is PSD and moreover simultaneous permutations of corresponding rows and columns do not change the set of eigenvalues.",0
LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS because the new elements in the tuple are false variables depending on the original variables.,0
The last point of the previous remark forces us to introduce the next notion in order to keep short notations easier to understand.,0
All the presented lemmas about the interplay between the L-form and the trace in the extension of the relaxation together with the trace inequalities studied above have as a consequence our main theorem.,0
Symmetric matrices constructed via extensions of the multiplicative arrange Now we are ready to see that the initial matrix of our extension is indeed PSD.,0
"For the proof of the next result, we basically copy the strategy followed in the proof of [Sch23, Theorem ] based in reducing our general problem to the case n= where the (hermitian) Helton-Vinnikov theorem is available and thus we can use the existence of a MLMPDR of RZ polynomials to express the form Lp,ein terms of traces of the matrices in that MLMPDR of p, which simplifies drastically the development of the proof.",0
"L p,efor any integer e d:=deg(p)to all the entries of any MMM of the form given by Equation for any RZ polynomial p RRZ[x]produces a PSD matrix.",0
"In order to prove this inequality, we choose an orthogonal matrix U Rn n such that u:=UTwand u :=UTw lie both in R2 {} Rn.",0
"we know now that Lr,e(x2 (u Tx)) 2tr(A1K A1K +A2 1K ) so we can write the next chain of inequalities instead of those in the proof of Lemma .",0

in some cases for all (or enough in the sense of covering all the possible cases of vectors v) the possible bivariate polynomials robtained from pvia the mechanism described in the proof.,0
Our experiments show that these matrices are PD almost always and thus it is convenient to study when these matrices have not all zero eigenvalues.,0
above in order to find the necessary strengthening of the conditions that allow us to determine that any of the inequalities that are used in that proof is strict.,0
"The complicated statement of the lemma comes thus probably from the somehow artificial procedure that is performed there in order to reduce the multivariate RZ polynomial pto the bivariate RZ polynomial r, but we cannot in principle, in general, avoid this procedure as we just have available the HeltonVinnikov theorem on variables.",0
"Nevertheless, a clearer procedure is likely to exist because, as we said, our experiments show that almost all matrices formed by the procedure described at the beginning of the statement, i.e., Lp,e Mfor random RZ polynomial p RRZ[x]are PD, as expected.",0
"But before, first of all, we note that the excluded case w==w is trivial as then we have that the second equation does not have to be considered at all and the first equation is true as (, )Lp,e M(, )T=Lp,e = e>.",0
"that the first inequality in each of the two previous equations is strict if A1K A1K =A2 1K 2and the second inequality is strict if the matrices Id+K+ 2A1K + 2K A1orK+ 2A1K + 2K A1, respectively, have not all zero eigenvalues.",0
"Thus, inasmuch as our problems for clarity in these conditions seem to come from the reduction to the case n =, we will avoid this reduction in order to find other conditions easier to express but, at first, this will lead us naturally towards a restriction to polynomials having monic linear matrix polynomial determinantal representations (MLMPDRs), which are all RZ polynomials for n but not anymore all RZ polynomials for n (due to well-known dimensional counts).",0
"LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS Doing this ampliation, we hope to find nicer conditions that we will try to extend to all RZ polynomials and not just those admitting a MLMPDR.",0
The proof of the next corollary corresponds basically with the previous proof with the omission of the restriction to two variables performed through orthogonal transformations.,0
"p=det(Id+x1A1+ +xnAn)produces a PD matrix if, for every pair of vectors w ,w Rnnot both zero, we have that A 1K A1K =A2 1K 2or that linspan ({A1, . .",0
"First we remember that, by [Br 11, Theorem ], we can always suppose that s=d. Using the first part of the proof of Lemma .",0
"LIMITATIONS OF IMMEDIATE MATRIX EXTENSIONS altered by any (orthogonal) transformation on the variables, it can be observed easily that the first inequality in each of the two previous equations is strict if A1K A1K =A2 1K 2and the second inequality is strict if the matricesId+K+ 2A1K + 2K A1orK+ 2A1K + 2K A1, respectively, have not all zero eigenvalues.",0
"However, we can lightly mention an interesting possible approach to study that problem using the already cited [Kum17, Theorem ].",0
"At this point, it is therefore evident that we cannot avoid a deeper study of Lp,ein terms of the coefficients of pif we want to go further because the expression of Lp,ein terms of traces, although helpful to shorten our previous proofs until this point, seems worn out when we cannot ensure anymore the existence of MLMPDR for our RZ polynomials.",0
This ampliation of the relaxation matrix tells us that it is possible to extend the matrix mold keeping the condition that the initial matrix is PSD.,0
"However, our experiments show that the polynomial obtained through this method is not in general a relaxation in the sense that it respects the original RCS.",0
"Surprisingly, after some work over the structure of the relaxation defined in [Sch23, Definition ], we will find that the mentioned multivariate result admits a straightforward proof not involving any generalization of [KP17] but just easy results from [Sch23].",0
"p=det(I+xD) R[x]with D diagonal, then r :=p+yq,with q the Renegar derivative of p ,has the determinantal respresentation r =det(I+xD+yE)with E the all ones matrix.",0
"This follows immediately from the definition of trace and the multiplication of matrices, noting that multiplication by diagonal matrices corresponds to multiplying each row or column (depending on left or right multiplication) of that matrix by the corresponding diagonal element.",0
"set on the RHS of the equation above appears as the intersection with the line y= of the relaxation S(r)of the extension rofp, i.e., p=r|y=.",0
"a hermitian matrix A, we say that is asignedly extreme eigenvalue if is either positive and the maximal or negative and the minimal.",0
a bivariate RZ polynomial p R[x]and one of its determinantal representations p :=det(I+ x1A1+x2A2)with A ia (complex) Hermitian matrix for each i [].,0
"Finally, we see that k(b1,b2) bd(C(p))because there we have that the LMP describing pis the diagonal positive semidefinite matrix I+kBthat has at the last element of the diagonal.",0
"For completeness, we decide to give this proof for the first point in the proposition, but it also works for the second.",0
We denote aijkthe entry in row jand column kof the matrix Aiand aijthej-th row (or column because the matrices will be symmetric) vector of the matrix Ai.,0
"These simplifications result in the fact that we want to find a point in the intersection of the borders of the proposition with p:=det(I+x1D+x2A2)and q:=det(I+x1D+x2A2+yL)with D:=A1 diagonal (with positive and negative entries) and Lan all zero matrix except a one in one of the corners of its diagonal (which depends on the choice of the eigenvector to be (, , . . .",0
"so ( 1, )is in bd (C(p))and the proof finishes simply undoing the transformation Uso we get the intersection point 1(b1,b2).",0
There is a more geometric approach to the proof above that one might try at first but that turns out to produce only a partial proof of the lemma.,0
"particular, the geometric approach uses the determinant of the matrix obtained at the beginning of the proof instead of continuing directly with the definition of PSD-ness.",0
"This approach has a clear limitation: it needs the mentioned determinant to be nontrivial at the origin and therefore it produces a proof valid only for polynomials p R[x]verifying that this determinant is not at the origin, which, in particular, implies that the matrices of their relaxations are PD at the origin.",0
"In particular, this means that the determinant of the matrix polynomial defining the relaxation of the corresponding RZ polynomial is, up to a constant, a RZ polynomial.",0
We describe this approach in the next warning as a way to show why the use of the determinant might produce only partial proofs if we are not careful enough.,0
Hence showing that the use of the determinant of the matrix polynomial defining the relaxation might be dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.,0
(Problems taking determinants before it is due) .We begin this warning just after the expansion of the matrix in the proof above.,0
".We force each restriction pAto behave, for every operation that requires taking the degree into account, as if it had the same degree of the polynomial pwe are restricting at each moment.",0
"Because we choose Usuch that UTa=||a||e1we, in fact, have proved the identity Sa(p) ={ R| ||a||e1 S(p(Ux))}=S||a||e1(p U), which finished the proof of this point. .",0
"= Sb((p U) A)because this is in fact just { R| b S(pA)}={ R| b S((p U) A)}, which gives the result concerning to this point and finishes the proof.",0
The uniformity in the choice of the set U of transformations U for associated to will be important in the proof of the Fact .,0
During this particularization we introduce also other conventions along the lines mentioned on this paragraph that will make our steps clearer during our future arguments and proofs.,0
"Moreover, grouping via the uniform choice of U for each plane (see Equation ), this is equivalent to the plane-by-plane uniform condition L(p U )((+ keT 1x)(+ (le1+me2)Tx)) for all l,m Rfor all .",0
"(x1,x2)and renaming e1,e2 R2, the condition in Equation (before grouping) is equivalent to the bivariate condition L(p Ub)(x)((+ keT 1x)(+ (lbe1+mbe2)Tx)) for all b Rn.",0
"After grouping (see Equation ), this condition is equivalent to the planeby-plane uniform condition L(p U )(x)((+ keT 1x)(+ (le1+me2)Tx)) for all l,m Rand .",0
"The condition in Equation above is therefore equivalent, by the choice of , to L(p U)(x)((+ keT 1x)(+cTx)) for all c R2for all U U .",0
Now we will pursue a different chain of equivalences beginning on the RHS of the statement that will end up on the condition in Equation above finishing the proof.,0
"Observe, following the condition on the RHS, that T b RnSk(,)(pe1,b)iffLpe1,b((+ keT 1x)(+cTx)) for all c R2 for all b Rn, which is equivalent, by the chain of equalities in Equation above, to L(p Ub)(Abx)((+ keT 1x)(+cTx)) for all c R2for all b Rn, which is equivalent, by Proposition .",0
"Thus this case is covered by the case b=e2because it produces the same matrix Ue2=Uk1e1=Iand thus the same polynomial p=p Ubin the subindex of L. Therefore, as the vectors b Rnthat verify mb = cover all the cases and when mb = we have that, when cvaries in all R2, so does Abc, we have a final equivalence to the condition L(p Ub)((+ keT 1x)(+cTx)) for all c R2for all b Rn, which coincides with the final condition in Equation (the conditions in Equations and are the same) of the chain above beginning in the LHS and finishes this proof connecting via equivalences the conditions of the LHS and the RHS of the statement.",0
this theorem and orthogonal diagonalization we know that every bivariate RZ polynomial pwith p = and d:=deg(p)admits an expression of the form CHAPTER .,0
and the particular sentence is a direct consequence of applying that rewriting together with the Helton-Vinnikov theorem.,0
"Not contemplating this carefully enough would have created the problem that p R[x,y], as defined at the beginning of the section in Definition ., is not exactly the determinant of an extension of the LMP in the given determinantal representation of p R[x]but something similar due to the different homogenization that we could obtain in the course of the proof of Proposition ..",0
"Thus, for the independent matrix (of the relexation) corresponding to the polynomials por pwe have the list corresponding to the set {,x1,x2,y,x1y,x2y,y2} of monomials that appear for the first time on such matrix: .",0
"=p2=D(p)=d2, for the matrix coefficient of a1(of the relexation) corresponding to the polynomials por pwe have the list corresponding to the set {x2 ,x1x2,x2 1y,x1x2y,x1y2} of monomials that appear for the first time on such matrix: .",0

"In fact, this shows that these matrix polynomials share many of their entries and some internal relations between the entries of each one of these matrix polynomials itself.",0
"We will concentrate the expression of Udirectly in the first (independent) term of each expansion of the corresponding matrix polynomials M p(a1,a2, ) orMp(a1,a2, )for simplicity.",0
"This preview will show that the line defined by the top left entry of our matrices plays a special role, but at the same time it will not help because of the triviality of the determinant of the first matrix polynomial.",0
"INVARIABILITY UNDER KNOWN VARIABLE EXTENSIONS where for clarity we preferred not to expand the entries l,mcorresponding to their obvious cofactors because they have to disappear anyway (because of repetition of rows |M24|==|M34|) and we performed several permutations of rows to allow for the appearance of the uniform cofactor |M44|showing that the matrix M14is matrix M44after we permute first and last rows first and then second and third rows; that is why we wrote ( )2as a factor whose exponent accounts for the two permutations performed.",0
"+a2C(x2,p))(corresponding to the top left entry of our matrix polynomials) that appears as a factor of the determinant det (M p(a1,a2, ))of the matrix polynomial M p(a1,a2, )defining the relaxation of pwhen the third coordinate is set equal to .",0
"without using determinants, the analysis of the determinants here is not helpful at all (it does not even give a partial proof) because one of our matrix polynomials will always and trivially have determinant , i.e., det (Mp) = .",0
Therefore we need alternative ways of dealing with our problem of relating the sets where these two matrix polynomials are PSD.,0
"Therefore Bis obtained from the PSD matrix Aby increasing a nonnegative term of the diagonal of such PSD matrix A by a factor k , which immediately implies that Bis also PSD. .",0
"Then, using Sylvester s criterion, we know in particular that all the principal minors involving only the top left submatrix of Bare nonnegative.",0
This submatrix is shared with Aand thus we can cover already a big portion of the principal minors of Aguaranteeing that these are nonnegative.,0
"Now we only need to use one direction of Sylvester s criterion to prove that Ais PSD, which establishes this implication and thus finishes the proof of this lemma.",0
showed us that the structure of these matrix polynomials (at each a R2) coincides precisely with the structure of the symmetric matrices related in the mentioned Lemma ..,0
"Note that the argument using the trace also works here but it is less direct, clear and elegant than the proof we just gave.",0
"(Another path in previous proof) .Clearly, we could have proceeded with the proof analogously because the inclusion follows from [Sch23, Lemma (c)] in the same way.",0
"That is, this result about the invariance of the relaxation for this particular transformation will automatically open the door for us to consider similar but less direct transformations that will actually produce a change in the respective restriction of the relaxation, which is the topic of future parts of this dissertation.",0
"Renegar derivative does not help In this section, we put together the two final results from the two previous sections in order to prove that the relaxation does not improve considering pinstead of p. Thanks to these results, the proof of this fact will be almost immediate.",0
This remark therefore forces us to make the next assumptions about our choices in order to work smoothly through our proofs.,0
INVARIABILITY UNDER KNOWN VARIABLE EXTENSIONS We introduce an easy lemma that will simplify the proof of the result that we want.,0
We make clear that the comment at the end of this proof is a landmark of this section because without the convention of Remark .,0
"This proves the identity in Equation (i.e., S(a,)( p) = Sa(p)) for each direction a Rnand establishes the remaining inclusion finishing therefore the proof of this theorem.",0
"During the chain of identities in the proof above, one might want to continue the third line with the equivalent expressionT b Rn{ R| (, , ) S((p+yp)a,b,(,,))}=:T b RnS(,,)(( p)a,b,(,,)), obtained using Notation .",0
"at the end of Section but for the special case of p. The reason why that expression does not produce a proof (contrary to the chosen expression) rests in the fact that the additional variable yof prequires a special treatment (given in the form of an additional vector (, , )) and this implies a tridimensional restriction that we did not study in this document.",0
On Eulerian Polynomials Chapter A Primer on Eulerian Polynomials and Statistics and Patterns on Permutations We gave several general references on Eulerian polynomials and numbers at the end of the previous part in order to introduce the reader into the wonderful world they open and prepare the journey we have ahead.,0
"As the reader could see, the realm of these polynomials, their meaning, their properties and their generalizations is vast and at least as ample as the realms of the objects they encode: descent statistics on permutations.",0
(Counting finer) .The particular tagging elements that we will use and describe here refer to the descent top and the ascent top statistics over permutations.,0
"their combinatorial interpretation, the Eulerian polynomials, their coefficients and their multiple extensions and generalizations to new frameworks and settings appear among the most studied objects in combinatorics and algebra, making special appearance in questions related to, e.g., unimodality, log-concavivity, gamma-positivity or real-rootedness.",0
"Recently, many generalizations of these polynomials and their coefficients have been connected to deep questions in order theory and algebraic geometry through the study of the geometry of matroids.",0
A PRIMER ON EULERIAN POLYNOMIALS very hot topics in (algebraic) combinatorics we refer the reader to [GW16; SZ12; SW20; AJ24; KK24].,0
"The proof is by induction noting that E1=+x=A1and that, with the induction hypothesis for n , for a positive integer n>, we have the next identity emanating from the well-known recurrence relation of Eulerian polynomials mentioned above in Proposition .",0
We can use that element to tag a new variable and therefore force our polynomials to carry this extra information about the descents at play in the corresponding permutation we are measuring or looking at.,0
Multivariate Eulerian polynomials The multivariate extensions that we will describe here use the descent top and the ascent top statistics over permutations.,0
"Now, finally, we can state the main theorem that allows us to apply the relaxation to this multivariate generalizations of the Eulerian polynomials.",0
"(Number of adequate descents) .[HR08, Theorems and ] Denote PX,Y n,sthe number of Snwith at least sadequate descents for the pair (X,Y).",0
"(Formula for number of n-permutations with a fixed number of descents and whose tops are in a fixed set) .[HR08, Theorems and ] We have the following two formulas for PX n,s= |Xc n|!s r=( )s r|Xc n|+r rn+ s r x Xn(+r+ X,n,x) = |Xc n|!|Xn| s r=( )|Xn| s r|Xc n|+r rn+ |Xn| s r x Xn(r+ X,n,x).",0
"We only prove the first identity, the second follows similarly and its detailed proof can be consulted in [Dav+, Appendix A].",0
"Moreover, by solving some asymptotic equations, we will be able to go even beyond and analyze further terms of the asymptotic growth of these roots.",0
The precise path we follow in order to modify the proof so we can be more precise is based on solving an asymptotic inequality.,0
"(Devising a way to improve the estimate) .We wrote Equation describing Eulerian numbers in terms of the quantities q(n) i. Instead of estimating as roughly as Stanley did in the MO post and we saw above, we can estimate a few asymptotic inequalities and proceed to use the next Equation involving the absolute values of the roots q(n) iand the Eulerian numbers.",0
"After that equation, we will follow a different path that will allow us to say more than him using the asymptotic notions introduced above.",0
Then we can estimate the growth of the absolute value of the k-th root of the n-th univariate Eulerian polynomial A nas lim n |q(n) k|  k+ kn+=. Proof.,0
fast growth of the coefficients allows us jump into the next equation involving a smaller degree coefficient in order to establish separation results about the roots.,0
There is another trick we used in the proof that was helpful in order to help us avoid dealing with limits that could have possibly not existed.,0
"But now, under our hypothesis that |q(n) | 2n+ this implies that the sum on the right-hand side of Equation can never catch up with the growth of the term 2n+1in the left-hand side as such sum is asymptotically bounded as follows n i=|q(n) i| |q(n) |+ (n )|q(n) | |q(n) |+ (n )n3n+ 2n+=I(n) and it is clear that lim n I(n) 2n+=lim n |q(n) | 2n+<.",0
The refinement of the proof of Stanley that we made above and the development of the ideas it raised impulses us to go beyond.,0
"In particular, the proof invokes new ways of thinking about the asymptotic behaviour of these roots and also open questions about dealing with asymptotic (in)equations in a manner that will be important for us in future sections.",0
"Moreover, the techniques refined here deal with a kind of (in-)equations that provoke much interest to us: asymptotic (in-)equations have made appearance in our work this way.",0
"(Devising forms to look beyond) .In due time, we will generalize and expand our understanding of asymptotic equations in order to extract further information about the growth of these roots.",0
"Following this path, we will find new tools and ways to look at these asymptotic equations when dealing with further terms of the growth.",0
"In particular, we showed that the answer to that question was already hidden in the literature, as the proof is just a slight modification of Stanley s argument.",0
"SOBOLEV , STANLEY, STUMP AND MEZ O use of a Colucci estimation that comes from the next classic theorem in the theory of polynomial inequalities.",0
"(Using Colucci estimation) .Rearranging the terms in the inequality provided by the theorem, we see that this result actually allow us to estimate the majorant Mwhenever we have information about the derivatives of pat some points.",0
"This is so because the row, column and matrix coefficient corresponding to the never appearing variable x1are in fact always and therefore can be omitted giving thus row and columns.",0
This makes therefore it into an n nmatrix for the matrix associated to the simplified relaxation of the n-th multivariate Eulerian polynomial An.,0
"R[x]provides us therefore with a matrix polynomial Mn(x):=Mn,+n+ j=2xjMn,j Symn+[x] positive semidefinite at the origin, i.e., Mn,0is PSD.",0
"Now, if we want a linear bound, we have to analyze the behaviour of the kernel of the matrix obtained when xis the largest root xn,rof det (Mn,+xM n,sum)(which has to be negative as it must in fact be xn,r q(n) nbecause of the property of being, in fact, a relaxation).",0
For analyzing the behaviour of such kernel we will have to act cleverly and guess through numerics and experimention a good approximate CHAPTER .,0
"A matrix polynomial p(x) =A+xB Symn(R)[x], where Ais a PSD matrix, will verify v (A+xB)v=v Av+xv Bv for all v Rnand x rcs(det(p)).",0
The procedure followed in the proof above clearly shows us why it is beneficial to look through guesses of eigenvectors instead of spending so much energy trying to establish the optimal bound given by the relaxation.,0
We want to apply the multivariate relaxation as this is new and it already depends in results coming from real algebraic geometry.,0
"Also, around [MP13, Equation ] one can find interesting information about methods to estimate roots of polynomials computing eigenvalues of companion matrices.",0
"This is helpful and is in agreement with the definition of proper position in [Br 07, Section ] and with the notion of interlacing used in [Ble+], as it can be seen at the beginning of their proof of [Ble+, Lemma ].",0
"The last part admits an alternative direct proof that we also introduce here because it is more direct, although it does not show the relations between the different notions of interlacing in the different settings, as the previous discussion did.",0
"Now, we can use the fact that we obtained a real linear combination of the reciprocals of the original polynomials and an application of the well-known Obreschkoff-Dedieu Theorem (see [Br 04, Theorem ]) to immediately finish this proof.",0
"As we are mainly interested now only in root bounds for the univariate polynomial, we can set y= above and study the resulting matrix polynomial.",0
"However, here, for brevity and sanity, we prefer to use a technique that will also help us in the future, when solving equations exactly will not even be a far-fetched possibility.",0
"Hence, this way of approaching will save us some energy at the same time that it allows us to contemplate, through a kind of toy example, how we will proceed in the future.",0
"We have to find a method to determine which one of these roots corresponds to the maximum of our fractionN D. Before seeing this, we have to notice that Dmust always be nonnegative for any due to the fact that the relaxation has always its initial matrix PSD.",0
This univariate relaxation has appeared previously in the literature of statistics but not (to our knowledge) in the literature of approximations of roots of polynomials and it has shown here to be surprisingly good to estimate extreme roots of this family of polynomials.,0
We say that the matrix N Rn m with n n and m mis acompression ofMifNis obtained from Mafter summing some of its rows and columns suppressing the appearance of the rows and columns being added to another one.,0
(Action of the all-ones vector) .Choosing the vector Rn+1of all-ones will give the same result that we obtained in the univariate case because this choice compresses the matrix given by the multivariate relaxation to the one obtained in the univariate case above.,0
"the study of this second set of vectors we introduce, for clarity, the reduced relaxation, which is the relaxation of size n+ obtained after deleting additionally the first row and column (these corresponding to the application of the Lform to monomials up to degree in the initial matrix) and reintroducing the (always ) row and column corresponding to the index temporarily.",0
.When we we change the index jwe look deeper in the matrix and therefore we have in mind more information about the split of descents by their tops.,0
This corollary makes formal what we commented above about going deeper into the matrix in order to extract further information about the splitting of the descents among the tops in the multivariate polynomial.,0
Thus it is not surprising that looking at the densest part of the matrix in the information about the variable that completes the splitting of the descents provides us with the best possible vector attainable in this way.,0
"some experiments, we know numerically that the application of the relaxation to the multivariate Eulerian polynomials augments the accuracy of our bounds in the for the univariate Eulerian polynomials lying in the diagonal.",0
"In particular, we will use the exponential scale we talked about before and we will write, analyze and solve (in-)equations in the corresponding coefficients of the expansions of the bounds in these scales.",0
We have this objective because we can see in numerical experiments that the relaxation applied to the multivariate Eulerian polynomials should give us better results and we want to prove that we do indeed obtain something better in this manner.,0
", xn+(x1is never actually appearing) and degree nand, therefore, the full relaxation corresponding to the n-th Eulerian polynomial has size n+ but the second (the first in the simplified relaxation) row, column and matrix coefficient are always just and therefore irrelevant.",0
"the previous section could look depressing in terms of using the multivariate approach to find better bounds, numerical experiments show that the multivariate relaxation gives, in fact, slightly better bounds.",0
This is why the numerical experiments push us in the current direction consisting in exploring further that relaxation through sequences of vectors with a more elaborated structure that could extract more information about the polynomial from the relaxation through linearization.,0
"In any case, performing this optimization is way more doable from a computational and practical point of view than proceeding through the determinant.",0
"In particular, the optimization step we make in this section in order to establish one of the entries of the sequence we treat here will be reused in the future and it has been, in fact, a very important tool in our path towards the exploration of even better sequences.",0
"This means that in this case and for the first time in this bounding process of the extreme roots of Eulerian polynomials through the relaxation, we are using a deeper theorem from the theory of real algebraic geometry.",0
s proof in [Sch23] that the relaxation is indeed a relaxation for polynomials of strictly more than one variable uses Helton-Vinnikov theorem.,0
"We did not take advantage of this theorem so far because the winner up to this point was the all-ones vector, whose use is equivalent to considering only the relaxation applied to the univariate Eulerian polynomial.",0
"Optimizing the bound provided by v:= (y, , , ) Rn+2over the parameter ywill give us a function of nthat we will use also in future experiments.",0
This optimization of the bound will give us yas function of nand this ywill be obtained as a solution of a quadratic equation.,0
"Notice that Dmust always be nonnegative for any yas the relaxation has its initial matrix PSD and therefore we do not have to be so careful with Das we have been with Nat the choice of y; for Dwe just have to check that, for the chosen y, we have D =.",0
This last condition forces us to study the difference multi v(n) uni(n) in order to find a sequence y(verifying the condition expressed in Equation above) such that multi v(n) uni(n)>.,0
The only time when obtaining a for a difference in asymptotic algebra is justified is when the two expression are exactly the same .,0
"In order to access and create intuitions about the form and the structure of the new vectors we need, we perform many experiments.",0
The journey towards the discovery of the structure of the approximated generalized eigenvector we use and the proof that it does indeed produce the improvement we seek is the content of the next section.,0
"This chapter will be heavily computational both symbolically and numerically, as many experiments had to be performed in order to find a good approximated solution to the generalized eigenvector problem we had in our hands.",0
And this is how these experiments allowed us to construct a vector good enough to give us a precise enough approximation to the generalized eigenvector we need in order to linearize our problem and obtain the better asymptotic bounds that we will compute in this chapter.,0
"After seeing how we perform these experiments to search for nice enough guesses for our linearizing approximation of generalized eigenvectors, things are finally set in motion.",0
"These are the roots that end up getting sufficiently close to or in the sense that they lie out of the interval [ M, M]forM> used in the previous Theorem. Remark .",0
(Unknown behaviour) .Notice that Sobolev mentions before stating the main theorem of this second paper that the asymptotic behaviour of a certain portion of the end roots remains unknown for now .,0
"That seems to mean that, when he wrote the proof of such theorem, he did not know how to extend the techniques used in his proof to these other end roots whose asymptotic behaviour remained therefore out of the scope of the result in the previous paper and of the new result that he goes on to present just after that sentence.",0
COMPARISONS SOBOLEV first to introduce some terms that Sobolev introduces in the middle of his proof during the derivation of his Equation in his fourth paper dedicated to Eulerian polynomials in [DV06].,0
The possible refinements of the proof of this theorem constitute the main object of our analysis of Sobolev s work in this chapter.,0
"That is, we will not work with the punctual estimation provided by the theorem but with intervals given in terms of minorants and majorants that we will extract through several refinements from of the techniques involved in the proof of this theorem.",0
"last paper about the roots of Eulerian polynomials in [DV06] gives another estimate for the error in Equation , which actually rests in Equation , which eventually comes from Equation after applying logarithms.",0
"Remember and notice anyway that Sobolev bounds, as explicitly stated by him in the proof of the theorem, do not allow even establishing the second growth term.",0
"Part IV Consequences of Sobolev: a Look through the Glasses of Dandelin-Lobachevski-Gr ffe and a Glimpse of a Multivariate Generalization Chapter DLG method in Sobolev argument In the work on the roots of Eulerian polynomials that we analyzed above and that can be found in four articles selected in [DV06], Sobolev made use of what he calls Lobachevsky equations .",0
We reproduce here the lemma and comment its proof in order to be able to detect how Sobolev s method differs from our approach.,0
"Observe that, for constructing his Equation , Sobolev uses his estimate binstead of the most accurate one that the lemma actually provides.",0
"the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality in the proof of [DV06, Chapter , Lemma ] presented above here might be seen as overkill, but it hints directly at the possibility of extending that lemma using the many known generalizations CHAPTER .",0
"For this reason, we focus on the stage at which Sobolev provides his lemma, that is, at the first iteration of the DLG method, as he has to use what he calls the Lobachevsky equation (i.e., the DLG method) to establish that lemma. CHAPTER .",0
"We tried an extension introducing further monomials in the matrix, but that worked in a limited way without having previously already a determinantal representation.",0
"In particular, just looking at the polynomial, this only allowed us to double the size of the initial matrix preserving its PSD-ness, but it destroyed the property of being a relaxation.",0
"(Building nice multivariate polynomials laminating the recursive or combinatorial information) .We can see in the proof of [VW13, Theorem ] how the multivariate Eulerian polynomials are built in a way that surely preserves stability through the operator inducing the recursion.",0
"Above [VW13, Theorem ] we can see the recursion for univariate polynomials that we rewrite as An= (n+)xAn (x) + ( x)(xAn ) .",0
"Instead of using these polynomials, for conformity with the expression in [VW13, Theorem ], we will look at the sequence of homogenizations {Ah i} i=.",0
Therefore the main problem here is that we are forced to choose between using interlacing in the recurrence or using addition of variables through the operator defining the recursion.,0
Involving recurrent information We live in times of recurrence and therefore it is impossible not to make here an observation about how some models of artificial neural networks that are taking over the train of the fast growing trend of artificial intelligence in the ongoing development of the technology sector benefits from recurrence in the chains that compose the human language in order to build these gigantic models [RHW86].,0
"This enhanced understanding (that can be combinatorial, algebraic or geometric) can therefore be transformed via the relaxation into analytic information about the extremal roots of the polynomial.",0
This opens the door to simplify the problem exposed by the GLC not to find MSLMP (monic symmetric linear matrix polynomial) representations of RCSs but just MSLMP representations of some (algebraic) transformations of these RCSs.,0
"Thus, we get a way of dealing with the high complexity of the algebraic elements involved in these representation by transforming the original object in a way that could resolve these complexities.",0
Then the coefficients of the polynomial q = d i=(x ak i) R[x]can be written polynomially in terms of the coefficients of p. Proof.,0
method of resultants hinted at in [ank] in the proof of the folkloric Theorem to study univariate real-rooted polynomials through transformations of their roots producing polynomials whose coefficients are polynomial combinations of the coefficients of the original polynomials produces completely new families and sequences of polynomials.,0
We finish this chapter by pointing out to the surprising fact that this task of real-root bounding seems to provide a very stable bridge for translating ideas between numerics and real algebraic geometry through combinatorics.,0
"STRUCTURED INTERLACERS IMPROVEMENTS ent paths of algebra and combinatorics, and that trip allowed us to traverse here the already mentioned bridge over which we ask to build a highway.",0
"Then we have the bounds r n> vT nRn,0vn vTnRn,totvn, where r ={rn} n=0is the sequence of the largest roots of the polynomials in A w. Proof.",0

"n+ n+2bijectively because it is obvious that the injection does not modify the descent top sets and we have just seen above in this proof, through the careful observation of Equation , that |R(n,L)|= |R(n+,L)|.",0
"Observe, furthermore, that this last bijection sends the elements with descent top L [,n+]ofSn+ n+ n+(and thus of Sn+2as this forces n+ to be fixed) to elements of Sn+ n+2whose descent top set is L {n+}, adding thus only n+ as a forced descent top (as it has to be so as soon as it is not fixed, i.e., at the end in the one-line notation).",0
"We also have to mention that, in general, finding the kind of bijection between permutations that we found in the proof above is an interesting topic by itself that has been previously studied, e.g., in [Big16; BS20; CL24] for bijections conserving other properties or accomplishing or involving different relational counting arguments.",0
Reciprocity from the permutation point of view Now we can translate many insights obtained in the last proof of the previous section into the purely combinatorial setting.,0
The corresponding bijection can be constructed composing the bijection given by Riordan in [Rio16] with the one we used in the proof of Theorem .. CHAPTER .,0
"COMBINATORIAL RELATIONS In order to analyze how special is the property proved in this theorem that motivated our last discussion and corollaries, we introduce a couple of concepts about (multiaffine) polynomials in the next section.",0
"mwas arbitrary among all the possible monomials and there are no cancellations on the definition of the Eulerian polynomials, this finishes our proof.",0
"Another project with a similarly close aim (but approaching more clearly by the combinatorial side) is the database [RS+], which therefore serves as a support for another side of our proposal.",0
We saw that a first constraint we find is the fact that natural ampliations using straightforward extensions of the mold moment matrix fail in keeping the initial matrix PSD.,0
These polynomials have therefore an algebro-combinatorial nature because they emerge from polynomials counting features of combinatorial objects through nice and simple algebraic transformations and manipulations.,0
It would be interesting to both understand which combinatorial objects these algebraic splitting methods are related to (if any) and if understanding these objects better could lead to multivariate generalizations of these univariate polynomials.,0
THE MINDELSEE PROGRAM numerical experimentation using the fact that we used the previous steps in order to make the relaxation relatively easy to compute.,0
"numerical experiments, we can understand how the relaxation works at approximating the inner roots of our original polynomials or even some other related ones.",0
"Without these experiments, it is not possible to make the choices necessary to simplify and select the information of the relaxation that we need to keep.",0
"There might be other paths based on matrix compression, but we will mainly center here around what we did in this thesis.",0
numerical experiments above will eventually show us some options of families or sequences of vectors that keep a fair amount of the information of the relaxation.,0
"Once we have them, it is natural to ask how good are they in comparison both with other methods and with applications of the relaxation to instances where fewer variables were forced structurally meaningfully into our multivariate polynomials.",0

"The method combines K-Nearest Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al., ) with meshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al., ) and constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c-RBFs, Sperotto et al., ).",0
"Keywords: KNN, c-RBFs, meshless algorithm, PTV, PIV Introduction The measurement of detailed quantitative field data of turbulent flows poses significant challenges due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved, which widens with increasing Reynolds numbers.",0
"While Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV, Raffel et al., ) has become a robust tool for this purpose (Westerweel et al., ), its ability to resolve turbulent scales is constrained by both the sensor size and the inter-particle spacing in the images.",0
"K ahler et al. demonstrated that, for average flow fields, the particle diameter imposes a key limitation on cross-correlation-based methods, confirming particle tracking as the most suitable approach to enhance spatial resolution.",0
"On instantaneous measurements, dense vector fields can be obtained with super-resolution Particle Tracking Velocimetry (super-resolution PTV, Keane et al., ), although its reliability is more dependent on image quality than standard cross-correlation. .",0
"In super-resolution PTV, the spatial resolution is determined by the smaller mean spacing between particles and their displacement between light pulses.",0
"In 3D velocimetry, the superiority of particle tracking over cross-correlation is even more established than that of the planar counterpart.",0
"The lower computational cost of evaluation, the lower risk of ambiguity in particle pairing, and the use of multiple cameras that allow disambiguating particles overlapping in an image using other views are factors that play in favour of particle tracking.",0
"In this framework, the notion of super-resolution refers to the derivation of a meshindependent analytical representation of the velocity field, allowing predictions at any point while simultaneously enforcing physical constraints (e.g., no-slip condition, mass .",0
Step : extraction of information from particles (PTV or LPT); step : local meshless POD directly on the particles within the subdomains into which the domain is partitioned; step : computing optimal number of neighbours and then increasing particle density; step : weighted regression trough c-RBFs to achieve analytical high-resolution approximation of the velocity field.,0
"Nevertheless, when processing instantaneous fields, the accuracy and feasibility of the method are constrained by particle availability.",0
A large class of methods leverages statistical evidence of correlation to increase the particle density in instantaneous realizations by borrowing information from other snapshots of the dataset.,0
"This principle gave rise to established techniques for resolution enhancement of turbulence statistics, see e.g single-pixel correlation (Meinhart et al., , Westerweel et al., , Scharnowski et al., ) and ensemble PTV (K ahler et al., , Cowen et al., , Ag uera et al., ).",0
"Recent advances in data-driven and machine-learning algorithms have led to push this concept to individual samples (Discetti and Liu, ).",0
"In the first category, K-Nearest Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al., ) stands out for its simplicity of implementation.",0
KNN-PTV is based on the idea of blending particles from different snapshots when local regions are sufficiently similar.,0
"On the other hand, KNN-PTV artificially increases particle density in individual snapshots, generating denser scattered distributions that enable c-RBFs to produce physically constrained and highly accurate superresolution fields.",0
"The key novelty to achieve a fully meshless algorithm is the use of the recently proposed meshless POD (Tirelli et al., ) to evaluate the similarity between snapshots in the KNN-PTV.",0
"The experimental assessment on threedimensional PTV measurements of a jet flow in air (described in ) is discussed in in terms of statistics ( ), spectra ( ) and modal analysis ( ).",0
"As in the KNN-PTV proposed by Tirelli et al. , the cornerstone of the superresolution is the merging of particles belonging to different snapshots to artificially increase the particle density.",0

"For this purpose, the domain is divided into subdomains and, for each of them at each time instant, the algorithm searches for the most locally similar realizations within the data ensemble.",0
"If the flow fields in a subdomain at different time instants are deemed sufficiently similar, their particles are merged to create a denser snapshot.",0
"Step : Particle detection The first step involves extracting information from particles using conventional PTV methods (Keane et al., ) or more modern Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) algorithms, such as Shake-The-Box (STB).",0
"In the implementation presented in this manuscript, particle identification and pairing are performed with a traditional PTV algorithm.",0
"The inner product over the spatial domain of all velocity field approximations is used to compute the temporal correlation matrix K, defined in terms of continuous inner product (Lumley, ) as: Kij= | |Z uT(x ,ti)u(x ,tj)dx , with| |the area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D) of the spatial domain considered.",0
"These are then used to construct a local feature training set, denoted as = r r RNt r, consisting of the temporal modes and the eigenvalues of the subdomain truncated at rank r, which is the number of modes that retain the % of the energy.",0
"This matrix can be obtained from the diagonal normalization of the matrix K S=K ( T), where RNtcollects the square root of the diagonal elements of Kand is the Hadamard division (entry by entry).",0
"In this step, the similarity is assessed in the reduced-order version of K, obtained retaining only the rmodes accounting for the % of the energy.",0
"The positions are subsequently found using the KNN algorithm, which operates in the more refined feature space provided by the mesh-free modes.",0
"The particle density is then artificially increased according to this map, borrowing particles from the knearest neighbours.",0
"Subsequently, the collocation points needed for the regression are placed through iterative agglomerative clustering as in Sperotto et al. .",0
"Penalties act as soft constraints , promoting the minimization of quadratic terms, while constraints are enforced through Lagrange multipliers .",0
The novelty compared to the original implementation by Sperotto et al. lies in the application of regression to an enriched particle distribution.,0
"This requires introducing a weighting metric in the regression process to account for the fact that some particles do not originate from the current snapshot but are instead from their neighbours, which may have varying degrees of similarity to the current snapshot under consideration.",0
The minimization of Eq. with respect to the RBFs weights and the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints leads to the following system of equations: D = mm0.4D 2D 3DUj Fig.,0
Experimental dataset: 3D jet flow The experimental validation aims to complete the process initiated with the first version of KNN-PTV.,0
"The assessment results reported in Tirelli et al. indicate that, although this algorithm produced encouraging outcomes, it struggled with larger PIV IW KNN-PTV c-RBF meshless KNN Table Spatial average of the root mean square error RMS evaluated for: PIV with interrogation window of pixels, KNN-PTV.",0
"This motivated the incorporation ofRBFs, enabling the algorithm to adapt to 3D scenarios while maintaining reasonable computational expenses.",0
"For this reason, the experimental validation proposed in this work is carried out on the same 3D jet flow of the above-mentioned paper.",0
"The process involves three camerasimultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (cSMART) iterations on a binned configuration, followed by three additional cSMART iterations and three SMART iterations at the final resolution of voxels/mm.",0
"Individual particles are identified in the reconstructed volume and paired, in accordance with the Tomo-PTV principle established by Novara and Scarano .",0
"The complete distribution of vectors is used to create a reference ground truth field by weighting the moving average of the vector distribution with a Gaussian window, where the standard deviation is equal to / voxels.",0
"The approaches evaluated here are tested on an artificially downsampled vector distribution, containing only , particles distributed within the volume.",0
"The mesh-free flow fields are generated by distributing the RBF basis across eight levels of clustering, ensuring a minimum number of particles per Gaussian of ,,,,,, and respectively, leading to an average value of , basis for the enriched fields and almost the half for the traditional c-RBFs.",0
"Additionally, / of the original particles are constrained to satisfy the divergence-free condition, which is further enforced as a penalty in the regression process.",0
"= : represents the standard approach in the field, obtained via a moving average with an interrogation window (IW) size of voxels; KNN-PTV : the first version of the algorithm as proposed by Tirelli et al. , included to highlight the improvements introduced by the meshless paradigm; c-RBF : meshless interpolation as in Sperotto et al. ; it isolates the benefits of introducing particles from other snapshots.",0
"On the other hand, the fully meshless nature of the method relies solely on particle positions, effectively avoiding modulation effects introduced by discretization on Eulerian grids at any step.",0
"For ensemble statistics, an additional reference is introduced: the EPTV approach developed by Ag uera et al. , using a bin size of voxels.",0
This method represents the state-of-the-art algorithm for ensemble statistics in PIV and serves as a further benchmark for comparison.,0
"Mean velocity field (left column) and resultant standard deviation squared (right column): a) Ensemble averaging (Ag uera et al., ) with bin size pixels, b) PIV with interrogation window of pixels, c) PIV with interrogation window of pixels, d) KNN-PTV, e) c-RBFs and f) meshless KNN-PTV.",0
"In addition to the reference PIV with IW = voxels, only for the comparison of ensemble statistics, the EPTV approach developed by Ag uera et al. , with a bin size of voxels (Fig. .a-left) is here used as further reference.",0
This is probably due to the low availability of particles combined with the large moving average window that is over-filtering the field.,0
"However, in the PIV with IW = voxels (Fig..b-right), despite being computed with the same number of particles ( ,), these peaks are smoothed out due to the larger window used for the moving average.",0
".c-right) shows a comparable pattern but with even more filtering, resulting from the combination of lower particle availability and a larger interrogation window.",0
"Three primary factors contribute to this: low particle availability in each snapshot, limited number of samples, and large interparticle spacing.",0
"Notably, the addition of particles provided by the KNN offers a slight boost to the already well-converged results of the c-RBFs.",0
"to the reference (Fig. .a), the former appears as a lower resolution version due to the lack of particles and larger moving averaging windows, that implies high smoothing effects on the field.",0
"The level of detail is increased thanks to the availability of particles borrowed from other snapshots, as shown in Fig.",0
"This is due to the filtering effect of using a larger kernel for the RBFs, while the meshless KNN-PTV can use smaller kernels due to the artificially-increased particle image density.",0
"Figure displays the streamwise component of the first four dominant spatial modes i, depicted in the plane z/D = and normalized by their standard deviation (p 3Np).",0
"This is primarily due to the lack of particles and the dimensions of such structures, which make their recovery very challenging with traditional POD.",0
"Although presented in the context of particle image velocimetry, the technique is of general application to all cases in which data are sampled at scattered locations at different time instants (e.g. with random moving or on/off sensors).",0
"This method increases the density of scattered data by borrowing particles (or more generally, samples) from similar snapshots, even without time resolution, while strengthening regression robustness by enforcing physical constraints all within a fully meshless framework.",0
"The results show promising improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution, validated through benchmark tests on experimental Dmeasurements of a jet flow in air.",0
"The main novelty of this approach is mesh independence, offering analytical representations of flow fields that can be easily interpolated and differentiated on any grid, enabling the extraction of high-resolution instantaneous fields and turbulence statistics.",0
"Moreover, the use of constrained regression allows for handling larger interparticle spacing by enforcing flow-physics-based constraints.",0
"The different analyses carried out in the paper demonstrate the following: first, the crucial role of physical constraints in regularising the reconstructed flow field to address the larger interparticle spacing typical of Dscenarios; second, the artificial increase of particle density by borrowing particles from similar snapshots helps in the reconstruction of the smallest scales, especially in sparse cases (although its performance is depending on the regularisation in post-processing); last, the superiority of regression-based techniques (whether weighted or not) over simple moving averages (weighted or not).",0
"It should also be noted that, while the methodologies examined may have reached their peak performance, the results of the fully meshless algorithm hold potential for further enhancement.",0

"We assume, that initializing the algorithm is free , and we can stop the algorithm s execution if the runtime exceeds a certain prespecified threshold known as TTL (time to live ).",0

"The simulation techniques of Luby et al. are used in solvers for satisfiability [ GKSS08 ], and constraint programming [ RBW06 ].",0
"An alternative, more flexible, model allows us to pause an algorithm s execution if its running time exceeds a certain threshold, resume its execution for a prespecified time, and repeat this process for as many times as necessary.",0
"Thus, one can run several (independent) copies of the original algorithm in parallel by dovetailing the iterations between them (for example, by round-robin scheduling the different copies of the algorithm one by one).",0

"This choice reflects the common practice in CNNs, where feature maps are typically represented as tensors of floating-point numbers, with the floatdata type being the most widely used.",0
"(a), the sensing error probability for a single observation ( K= ) is close to random guessing due to the overlapping of sample clusters, underscoring the importance of multiple observations.",0
"(c), is also evident: as Lgrows, channel diversity improves, reducing the packet loss probability and increasing the number of successfully decoded feature vectors, thereby lowering the sensing error.",0
"Larger Nallows for a higher quantization bits given coding rate, reducing source distortion, and also decreases the packet loss probability.",0
Our proposed adaptive coding rate design demonstrates effectiveness by achieving performance close to brute-force search while outperforming other benchmarks.,0
"Conversely, high-resolution features require a high coding rate for transmission, which dramatically increases the packet loss probability.",0
"This is because high transmit SNR and extended blocklength allow for the transmission of more bits (i.e., a feature vector with high resolution) with a low packet loss probability (i.e., ultra-reliable transmission).",0

"Bu tit isnot straightforward to obtain a mathematically rigorous proof nor even stateme nt of the QNEC, because both the precise formulation of second shape variation as we ll as the notion of entanglement entropy are subtle in QFT.",0

The result allows regularizations and computations of integrals that appear in quantum field theory (QFT) without performing the standard Wick rotation of time to imaginary values.,0
"The geometry of MS is closely related to properties of hyperbolae, replacing the basic circles used in Euclidean geometry: events at a constant spacetime distance, , from the origin follow surfaces of hyperboloids, given by r2 t2= 2where ris the -dimensional spatial distance from the origin, tis time (assuming the speed of light in vacuum, c= ) and the positive (or negative) sign indicates a spacelike (or timelike) relationship.",0
"Important restrictions on the propagation of fields are placed by the causal structure determined by light cones in this geometry, defined by 2= .",0
"However, there are closely related technical complications because invariant subsets in this geometry, given by hyperboloids as analogs of Euclidean spheres, are non-compact and often lead to divergent spacetime integrals of functions relevant in quantum field theory.",0
"For these reasons, the dynamics of quantum field theories are often evaluated not in their original Minkowskian form, but in a Euclidean form given by the -dimensional hypersphere, r2+t2= 2.",0
"Thirdly, while a Wick rotation fulfills the technical purpose of transforming a complex amplitude to a real statistical weight for standard action principles, such as the Klein Gordon field or Yang Mills fields, it is non-unique in some cases (notably for fermionic theories) and in others, requires further imaginary observables (such as quantum field theories at a constant chemical potential [, ]).",0
"Finally, a major challenge is the question of how to generalize the complexification procedure to quantum field theories on non-static curved backgrounds, or to non-perturbative gravitational interactions.",0
"These constructions pinpoint the crucial place at which non-compact hyperbolae are mapped to compact circle segments, with implications for the convergence of spacetime integrals as they appear often in quantum field theories.",0
The same construction will then be seen to solve also the main question of how to change the signature of the -dimensional geometry from Minkowskian to Euclidean without introducing complex coordinates or metric components.,0
"In applications to quantum field theory, the point mapping is directly applied to positions at which the fields are evaluated, and the changed line element implies specific sign factors wherever the metric is used in the integration measure or to raise and lower indices.",0
We also show in Appendix A that the above transformation is but one special case of a more general transformation discussed in []; thus many more mappings are possible within the geometry to be discussed next.,0
"Another parallel projection can then be used to map thecircles back to the xt-plane, now equipped with Euclidean geometry.",0
"Because these steps do not use specific properties such as right angles in the -dimensional geometry, they are able to bridge between different geometries.",0
"This sign choice implies that both planes, given by t= in the geometry d x2 dt2+ d 2and by x= in the geometry dx2 dt2 d 2, respectively, are spacelike, although with the negative-Euclidean sense for the latter case.",0
"For our purposes, it is sufficient to use only the direction of this vector and ignore its length, which would depend on which geometry we assign to the = 0-plane.",0
"A general point, p0, is projected from the hyperbolic Minkowski plane at = up to a unique point, p1, on the surface of the corresponding half-cone ( first projection ), then radially inwards parallel to the Minkowski plane to a unique point p2on the surface of the central cone ( second projection , see Fig. ) followed by a final projection back down to a unique point, p, on the 2D Minkowski plane at = ( third projection ), with the resultant geometry becoming Euclidean by a flip of metric components without the need for invoking Wick s rotation of the time coordinate.",0
We can therefore compute the norms of our projected vectors using the negative identity matrix as the tangent-space metric.,0
This result provides our basic ingredient for transformations of integrals as they may appear in different ways in quantum field theories.,0
INTEGRALS We now demonstrate that the our transformation correctly relates Lorentzian and Euclidean integrals as they commonly appear in calculations for quantum field theories [].,0
"In some cases, the results obtained in this way can be justified by an application of Cauchy s theorem, using a complex extension of the integrand to a holomorphic function and rotating integration over the real axis to integration over the imaginary axis based on the -prescription.",0
"In general, therefore, Wick rotation is a combination of Cauchy s theorem with regularization steps that are often spelled out incompletely, producing a finite value without a clear relationship to the original integral.",0
"However, our transformed geometry contains an additional factor of sech( ) in the metric which, as we already showed, maps non-compact hyperbolae to compact quarter circles.",0
"As an alternative regularization, we could use the Lorentzian independent area element but choose a different topology such that hyperbolas with the infinite extension of are compact.",0
"In this case, however, we have to adjust the integration limits 2N by hand in order to produce this value, while the correct result was obtained automatically by the canonical projections to Euclidean geometry.",0
Our full geometrical transformation is therefore important for applications to integrals that appear in quantum field theory.,0
"The resulting metric transformation , now in four dimensions, can directly be applied to standard scalar or Yang-Mills actions in Minkowski spacetime, which onlyrequire the metric tensor.",0
We will apply our geometrical transformation of metrics only to the tangent-space metric but not directly to the internal metric IJbecause the latter does not provide a geometry on the spacetime manifold.,0
"C. Field theories at constant chemical potential Many-body states with varying particle numbers require action principles at a chemical potential , together with a term with the particle density added to the integrand.",0
We used only constructions such as curves of equal distance from the origin or straight lines and planes for projections that can be generalized to geodesic properties in a curved geometry.,0
"Once a suitable auxiliary spacetime has been identified, the ingredients used in our construction, given by parallel and central projection as well as light cones and planes ofconstant , can be generalized using geodesics as well as the causal structure of a curved geometry.",0
"CONCLUSIONS Many constructions in quantum field theories for fundamental physics on spacetime require different kinds of regularization, among which the Wick rotation plays an important role.",0
"It has also been known for some time to fail in important situations such as quantum field theories at constant chemical potential, relevant in particular in studies of the quark-gluon plasma in lattice QCD, and for quantum field theories on non-stationary curved backgrounds or for quantum gravity.",0
"In fact, most approaches to quantum gravity make essential use of a Wick rotation without being able to provide an independent justification.",0
"Compared with a Wick rotation, there are two key advantages in that (i) field theories at constant chemical potential can be treated in a real manner on the Euclidean side, for both bosonic and, with an additional ingredients from the older [], fermionic ones, and (ii) non-stationary curved backgrounds and gravitational actions can, at least in principle, be analyzed using similar mappings generalized to curved spacetime.",0

"Even before lattice dimerization, pressure partly suppresses magnetic ordering, evident as a gradual reduction in the N eel temperature, TN, up to GPa in piston-cell experiments [, ].",0
"As our experiment shows an increase in sound velocity, this leads to a critical pressure, at which the sound velocity surpasses the Fermi velocity.",0
"This, in turn, causes the dominant scattering mechanism to shift from particle-hole to particleparticle processes, resulting in a transition from a linear increase of the sound attenuation with temperature, via an almost temperature-independent behavior, to a decrease with temperature [, ].",0
"The sound velocity, v, is related to the concomitant elastic constant cij= v2, where is the mass density of the material.",0
"This is consistent with the notion that the sound attenuation has contributions from microscopic processes, where a phonon scatters a positive-energy fermionic excitation of the nearby QSL to a higher-energy fermion state, dubbed particle-hole channel [, , ].",0
"Both, first-principles calculations [, ] and quantum-chemistry analyses [] have highlighted a significant dependence of magnetic coupling constants on pressure.",0
"We showed [], that the sound attenuation is linear in temperature when the phonon velocity vsis smaller than the characteristic velocity of the low-energy fermionic excitations, vF, as observed for the transverse phonon mode, (c11 c12)/.",0
"We see a monotonically increasing attenuation at P0, which arises from pure ph-scattering of the acoustic phonons in the regime vs< vF. At P1,vsis already slightly larger than vF, placing the system in the pp-scattering regime, where attenuation decreases with temperature as low-energy states become occupied.",0
"Although we estimate vs> vF, the difference between the two velocities is very small, allowing a ph-contribution from higher-energy states away from the fermionic cone.",0
The experimentally observed change in the temperature dependence of the sound attenuation occurs at slightly higher pressures (see Fig. ).,0
"Panels (b) and (e) compare the experimentally measured sound velocity, vs, with the theoretically estimated Fermi velocity, vF, for the two models as a function of pressure.",0
"Instead, and far more important, independent of the model used, we find a pressure-induced crossing, above which the calculated Fermi velocity of the QSL quasiparticles becomes smaller as the experimentally determined sound velocity.",0
The linear temperature dependence of the sound attenuation of(c11 c12)/2at ambient pressure beyond the ordered state is consistent with phonons scattered by Majorana fermions in a process dominated by particle-hole excitations.,0
"I.e., from our experimental findings, the measured sound velocity of (c11 c12)/2increases substan-tially with pressure, while from our theoretical analysis, the Fermi velocities of an effective J-Kmodel remain almost invariant with pressure.",0

"This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution.",0
"We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors.",0
"Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.",0
"The attractive nature of the interactions in these models ensures that the energy of a unit-charge in a soliton is lower than that of a free particle, causing charges to naturally coalesce and form a spherical configuration.",0

The distinction between amplification factors for energy/angular momentum and energy/angular momentum flux in such a multi-mode system was subsequently clarified in [].,0
This energy enhancement mechanism arises because the complex scalar contains two degrees of freedom and the Q-ball rotation in field space introduces coupled perturbation modes modulated by the Q-ball background; A key feature of the scattering process is that the number of particles in the ingoing and outgoing modes remains precisely the same and the energy enhancement comes purely from a redistribution among the different modes.,0

"Note that when we were finalizing this work, [] appeared, which contains some overlap with our paper in numerically evaluating perturbative energy extractions from FLS solitons.",0
"In Section II, we first introduce the FLS model and its formulation with dimensionless variables, which only contains one free parameter the mass ratio of the two scalar fields.",0
"Using the relaxation method (see [, ] for more details) with suitable boundary conditions, we then construct solutions of the FLS solitons for various frequencies and mass ratios.",0
"In Section III, we solve the linear perturbation equations on the soliton background again with the relaxation method, which is efficient in handling the case of large solitons with small Qand large , and derive the formulas to compute the energy and energy flux amplification factors.",0
We also extract the bounds on possible amplification factors with numerical optimization as well as analytically near the mass gap.,0

"Additionally, we define the dimensionless parameter =m2 /m2 , representing the mass ratio squared of the particles ande .",0
"Using the dimensionless Lagrangian , we derive the field equations: = V = 2 + 2 , = V = + 2 2+ 2 3, where is the Minkowski d Alembertian.",0
"The existence of the FLS soliton requires the modulus of frequency of the complex field to be smaller than the mass of the complex field but greater than zero, which can be expressed as []: >| Q|>.",0
These equations describe the radial behavior of the fields fQand Qunder the spherically symmetric and nonspinning ansatz.,0
"The resulting system consists of two coupled, nonlinear differential equations, which are challenging to solve analytically.",0
"In Section II B, we will employ the relaxation method to solve these equations, subject to appropriate boundary conditions.",0
"For given profiles Qand Q, the U charge and the energy of the FLS soliton are expressed as: Q= 4 QZ drr2f2 Q, E= 4 Z drr2Ttt.",0

"Indeed, as we will see later, it is rather challenging to solve the perturbation equations around large solitons with the shooting method.",0
"PERTURBATIVE SCATTERING In this section, we will investigate the scattering of waves on the background of the FLS solitons, building ....",0
The corresponding values of charge and energy are summarized in Table I. TABLE I. Charge and energy values corresponding to the solutions in Fig.,0
The perturbative fields resulting from this expansion provide essential information regarding the energy and energy fluxassociated with both incoming and outgoing waves.,0
"A. Perturbative waves To study the waves scattering on the background of the FLS solitons, we introduce small linear perturbations, denoted by and , on top of the FLS soliton solutions Qand Q.",0
"Specifically, we express the perturbative fields as: = Q+ , = Q+ , where Qand Qare the FLS soliton solutions that satisfy the field equations given by Eq.",0
"The perturbative equations of motion are more conveniently solved by performing a Fourier transformation into the frequency domain, factoring out the time dependence.",0
"To obtain a physically propagating solution for the three fields and +, we impose conditions on the wave number to guarantee a validity of the solution.",0
"Specifically, the conditions are given by: | Q |>,and| |> , such that all the wavenumbers k andk are real, representing propagating waves.",0
"In the extreme case of a very heavy field , where , the frequency satisfies | |> and the wave numbers approximate k2 + k2 2 .",0
"It is the U symmetry of the perturbation that enables the establishment of a conserved particle flux between the ingoing and outgoing modes, as demonstrated in Section III C. B. Boundary conditions As discussed in the previous subsection, the equations of motion for the perturbations, given by Eq.",0
"The set of equations is solved iteratively on a discretized lattice, and the derivatives are replaced by finite differences.",0
"C. Amplification factors In the previous subsection, we derived the suitable boundary conditions required to solve the system, and the wave amplitudes, denoted as A , B , C+, D+, can be determined via the perturbative solutions.",0
"These amplitudes contain the physical information of the ingoing and outgoing modes, and they can be used to derive relevant physical quantities, such as energy and energy flux.",0
"This symmetry implies the conservation of the particle number, where the combination of one positive charge and one negative charge gives rise to a single particle number.",0
"A natural definition of the amplification factors is the ratio of all outgoing particles, weighted by their corresponding physical quantities, to the ingoing particles.",0
"In other words, ANis the ratio of outgoing particle number to the ingoing particle number, Attis the ratio of energy density, and Artis the ratio of energy flux density.",0
"Due to the vector nature of the energy current, it is clear that there is a sign difference between the ingoing and outgoing modes.",0
"Therefore, a negative sign has been included by default when defining the energy flux amplification factors, meaning that only the magnitude of the energy flow is considered.",0
"We can verify that each term defined in this manner is positive for >.D. Amplification limits In the previous subsection, we derived the formulas of the amplification factors for both energy and energy flux.",0
"Exploiting the U symmetry for the system, we can deduce the conservation of particle number, which serves as a constraint.",0
"Note that these bounds are derived by leveraging the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative scattering equations, which do not depend on the specifics of the nonlinear interactions.",0
"Absolute bounds via optimization If the amplitudes of the ingoing modes ( A , B+and D+) are known, the amplification factor for energy can be formulated as a linear fractional optimization (LFO) problem.",0
"Below is a description of the LFO problem: Linear Fractional Optimization: Min (or Max) :aTx+c bTx+d subject to ex f, gx=h, where x Rnis the vector of decision variables, a, b Rn are vectors of constants, and c, d Rare scalar constants.",0
This formulation enables us to derive the general limits of the amplification factor for energy under arbitrary ingoing modes.,0
"Q= and = , and the dashed and dotted lines represent the upper or lower bounds of the energy amplification factor, respectively.",0
"It is evident that the upper and lower bounds of the energy amplification factor, when no amplitude constraints are imposed, are constructed from the bounds for single ingoing modes.",0
"Based on this understanding, it is straightforward to derive the bound of the energy and energy flux amplification factor.",0
"Due to the conservation of particle number, the bound of the energy amplification factor can be expressed as: max( AE) = min(AE)=max( E+, E , E ) min(E+, E , E ).",0
"This is because the upper (lower) bound for the amplification factor corresponds to the case where the single ingoing mode is in the lowest (highest) particle energy state, while the single outgoing mode is in the highest (lowest) particle energy state.",0
It is evident that the limits on energy flux are exclusively determined by the frequencies of the complex scattering waves.,0
"For each single ingoing mode, the limits of the energy flux are given by: Art (, + ),for|A |= , Art ( +,),for|B+|= , Art ( , + ),for|D+|= .",0
"For a very heavy real scalar field, when all perturbation modes correspond to propagating solutions ( > ), this condition is naturally satisfied, leading to an energy flux amplification close to .",0
"If the number of ingoing (outgoing) modes for each frequency is fixed, corresponding to the amplitude constraints, the upper and lower bounds of the energy amplification factor can also be determined.",0
"The upper bound is obtained by adjusting the outgoing (ingoing) mode with the highest (lowest) single-particle energy, while the lower bound is determined by adjusting the outgoing (ingoing) mode with the lowest (highest) single-particle energy.",0
"From the results of the calculation, we observe that a higher value of Qleads to an increase in the upper bounds of both the energy and energy flux amplification factors.",0
"Specifically, when Qapproaches its upper limit of , the calculated results for the perturbation equations indicate that the energy and energy flux amplification factors approach to .",0
Bounds near the mass gap We now turn to the asymptotic behavior of the amplification factors and the distribution of particles as the frequency approaches the mass gap or the high-frequency limit .,0
"It is obvious that both the particle numbers and energies are closely associated with the wave numbers, which may lead to divergent results in this limits.",0
"To properly understand the asymptotic behavior of the amplification factors, it is essential to separately consider the contributions from particle numbers and particle energies.",0
"However, the energy fluxes, which are not directly determined by the wave numbers, do not exhibit such divergent behavior.",0
"As a result, the non-divergence of the particle number ensures that the energy flux amplification factors provide a well-defined and finite bound in this asymptotic regime.",0
"For each single ingoing mode, if the parameter satisfiesn >, the amplitude terms are sufficient to counterbalance the divergence of the particle energy.",0
"For n > , the particle number and energy for and tend to zero, leaving only +, so the energy and energy flux amplification factors tend to .",0
"Below, we outline different scenarios corresponding to distinct single ingoing modes (with all unmentioned ingoing modes set to zero in each case): A = : The energy amplification factor is bounded as: lim 0AE (,( + Q)/).",0
"= ( + Q)/. This ratio represents the upper bound of the energy amplification factor, corresponding to the scenario where there is only one ingoing mode associated with A and one outgoing mode associated with C+.",0
"On the other hand, the energy E+for ougoing mode associated with A+, contributes a finite value, ensuring that the lower bound of the energy amplification factor is .",0
"The upper bound arises from the divergence of the outgoing particle energies E andE , while the lower bound corresponds to a scenario where no transformation into other particles occurs..",0
"Similar to the first scenario, although the outgoing particle energies exhibit divergence, their ratio remains constant, determining the range of the energy amplification factor.",0
"lim 0AE (,).These results highlight the dependence of the allowed frequency range on the mass ratio , and the associated divergences at specific energy and wave number values.",0
"The behavior is consistent across different values of n, which characterizes the asymptotic amplitude behavior near the mass gap to avoid particle number divergence forn /.",0
"In the high-frequency limit ( ), it becomes evident that the frequencies and wave numbers of the scattering wave exhibit similar asymptotic behavior.",0
"Therefore, to achieve a large energy flux amplification factor, it is not necessary to require a large , which corresponds to a heavier field +.",0
"NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section, we will present the numerical results for waves scattering around the FLS soliton, focusing on the energy and energy flux enhancements during the process, key features of the superradiance phenomenon, and methods for achieving higher amplification factors.",0
"The shooting method can be used to compute the perturbation equations around small solitons, so the cases of Q= , = 4and Q= , = 2are solved with the shooting method, which serves as a consistency check.",0
"When employing the relaxation method to solve these equations, it is essential to ensure that both absolute and relative errors remain below 10while conserving the particle flux, expressed as|AN | .",0
Effects of direct scaling of background coefficient W and background field scaling on the energy and energy flux amplification factors.,0
"The first two columns on the left show the energy amplification factors, while the two columns on the right display the energy flux amplification factors.",0
", we present the ratio of outgoing particle number for the parameters Q= and = , with left, middle, and right panels corresponding to the different ingoing modes: A = , B+= and D+= , respectively.",0
"For each single ingoing mode configuration, the outgoing mode corresponds to a different energy (or energy flux) than the ingoing mode, making it easier for the amplification factor to reach its upper limit.",0
"factor, a higher outgoing ratio, distinct from the ingoing mode, is required, especially when the outgoing mode has a higher energy (or energy flux) than the ingoing mode.",0
"The figures reveal several intriguing results, which we summarize and attempt to explain in the following discussion: A heavier real scalar field , generally produces a larger amplification factor, except in the case of energy flux with Q= and = .",0
"Factors affecting amplification The system consists of coupled equations, with the background coefficient represented by W. If this background coefficient Wis neglected, the system reduces to a set of decoupled equations, which evidently cannot produce any superradiance.",0
"Changing the Mass Ratio :Vary the mass ratio , consider different background solutions, and compute the amplification factors for each case.",0
"In Fig. , the direct scaling of the background coefficient Wand background field scaling with the energy and energy flux amplification factors are presented.",0
"The left and right columns represent the energy and energy flux amplification factors, respectively, with the single ingoing mode A = and parameters Q= and = .",0
"Energy and energy flux amplification factors for the single ingoing mode ( A = ) with Q= and = , for different background solutions.",0
"In fact, the amplification factor is more likely to approach to its limits due to the conversion rate of outgoing modes with higher energy flux.",0
"For FLS solitons, to achieve a larger background coefficient, a higher mass ratio is required, which in turn results in a larger potential energy term.",0
"Although increasing the background coefficient W, which can be achieved by increasing the mass ratio , may lead to lager amplification factors, we also need to test the real situation.",0
", we present the energy and energy flux amplification factors for the single ingoing mode A = , with different mass ratios and parameters Q= .",0
"It is clear that in the real situation, increasing the mass ratio can give us larger amplification factors, but when closes to (+ Q), the energy flux amplification factors decrease, which is because more of the outgoing particles are taken up by the energy flux particles, due to the heavier scalar field.",0
This tendency suggests that more particles are scattered and converted into particles of different energy(or energy flux) states.,0
"The underlying reason is that a larger fraction of high-energy particles are being converted into low-energy particles, redistributing the overall energy.",0
"Nevertheless, it remains possible to selectively introduce only low-energy incident particles while increasing the coupling coefficient ( i.e., adopting a background solution with larger mass ratio ) to achieve an enhanced amplification effect.",0
"Under these conditions, the coupled perturbation equations can be well-approximated by decoupled ones, which, although incapable of producing significant superradiant amplification, still allow for a remarkably broad range of amplification factors.",0
"When Qapproaches its lower bound, the allowed range of the energy flux amplification becames vary narrow, as discussed in Eq. .",0
"In this regime, even if the background coefficient Wis larger, the amplification remains limited to a small energy flux amplification factor.",0
"By contrast, the energy amplification factors for Q= and = , is significantly large, though this is not explicitly shown in the figures. .",0
", we show the energy and energy flux amplification factors for the single ingoing mode A = with parameters Q= and = , with different background solutions.",0
"This can be explained by the fact that a larger corresponds to a shorter wavelength, leading to more significant particle conversion in the region where the background coefficient is non-zero.",0
"When the amplitudes of different ingoing modes have a large distinction, leading to a significant difference in the ingoing particle numbers, the smaller amplitude mode can be neglected and treated as a single ingoing mode approximately.",0
", it is clear that by increasing the amplitude ofA , the energy flux amplification factors can reach higher values, as argued in Section III D. In Fig.",0
"V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have studied superradiant amplifications of waves around non-topological solitions in the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model, which after re-formulation with dimensionless variables contains one theory parameter , the squared mass ratio between the two scalar fields.",0
"We found that the relaxation method is effective to achieve sufficient accuracy in this case, which can be verified by checking the particle number conservation AN= .",0
"It is observed that for the case of double ingoing modes, increasing the amplitude of the low-energy complex-scalar mode tends to enhance energy and energy flux extraction.",0
"When the particle numbers of ingoing modes are fixed, the phase of the ingoing mode amplitudes can also influence the particle numbers of the outgoing modes, providing a means to achieve larger amplification factors.",0
"In the case of triple ingoing modes, with fixed particle numbers for the ingoing modes, the amplification factors depend on two phase parameters, resulting in a more intricate behavior.",0
"The particle number conservation, coupled with a linear fractional optimization scheme, also allowed us to derive the bounds on the amplification factors for generic scenarios of ingoing modes.",0
"Appendix A: Amplification limits for single scalar models In this appendix, we also present the absolute bounds on the amplification factors for waves scattering around aQ-ball in a single scalar model.",0
"While the relaxation method yields convergent solutions, these solutions do not necessarily respect the constraint of the particle number conservation.",0
"The middle and right subfigures display the errors of the energy and energy flux amplification factors, respectively, subject to the conservation of particle number.",0
"For example, when solving for a background soliton, we implement each iteration of relaxation with a matrix, which takes approximately one minute with parallel computation, corresponding to about points in the solution domain.",0
"To solve the perturbative scattering equations, we typically implement the relaxation with around points, corresponding to a matrix, and each requires approximately iterations.",0
"As discussed in Section III D, the energy and energy flux amplification factors can be interpreted as the parti-cle number, weighted by the particle energy and energy flux.",0
"In practice, we modify each amplitude to adjust the particle number and use the updated values to compute the energy and energy flux amplification factors.",0

"I. INTRODUCTION Among the various microscopic interactions shaping quantum materials, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has been a persistent subject of study since it stands at the origin of a broad variety of phenomena.",0
"One of the manifestations of strong EPC, which is lately attracting a large interest, is the appearance of a charge-density wave (CDW) phase in many materials [ ].",0
"While the charge-density-wave transition has been traditionally described in the weak EPC limit [], the discovery of compounds exhibiting strong momentum-dependent EPC has motivated both theoretical [ ] and experimental studies [ ].",0
"As a result, stronglymanuel.tuniz@phd.units.it federico.cilento@elettra.eucoupled CDW materials provide a compelling platform to study the interplay between lattice fluctuations and the emergence of a macroscopic quantum order.",0
"More broadly, lattice fluctuations are not only key to understand the CDW dynamics in VTe , but they are also believed to play a crucial role in the phase transition of a wide range of quantum materials [, ].",0
ARPES and TR-ARPES experiments were performed using a state-of-the-art HHG source equipped with a time-preserving monochromator and synchronized to an OPA system delivering the pump pulses [].,0
"The black arrows show the displacement direction of the vanadium atoms, while the black ellipse and dashed lines highlight the formation of a trimer-like bonding between three vanadium atoms, resulting in a double zigzag structure.",0
"fs, respectively, while the FWHM of the probe beam at the sample position was of the order of m. An home-built strain device was mounted on the sample holder, to perform photoemission experiments on strained samples (further details are reported in the SM).",0
"EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Strain-induced domain stabilization In the transition-metal dichalcogenide compound VTe , the presence of a strong EPC results in the opening of a CDW gap whose size is five times larger than the one predicted by the weak-coupling limit, making this compound an ideal candidate for studying the effect of enhanced lattice fluctuations on the CDW phase [].",0
The effectiveness of this approach was assessed by means of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and ARPES experiments.,0
These spectra therefore demonstrate the possibility of performing photoemission experiments on a single domain by applying a tensile strain to the VTe 2crystals.,0
"Since the only detectable effect of the applied strain is the promotion of larger domains, all the ARPES experiments presented below were performed on strained samples.",0
"We emphasize that, in the present case, the role played by the increased lattice fluctuations can be isolated only thanks to the large energy gaps that characterize the strongly-coupled CDW systems like VTe , which make the electronic entropy (that otherwise would have overshadowed these effects) unimportant in determining the phase transition [].",0

The energy injected by the pump in the system is initially absorbed by the electrons and then transferred to a subset of strongly-coupled optical phonon modes.,0
"Indeed, the broadening of the gap discussed above entails a reduction of the gap size itself, and therefore a reduction of the energy gain of the electronic subsystem with the consequent reduction of the amplitude of the lattice distortion.",0
"Moreover, given the presence of small bumps in the trace showing the evolution of the band shift, on top of this incoherent dynamics we summed a damped cosine oscillation with the frequency of the lowest-energy CDW amplitude mode [].",0
"As for the case of the gap broadening, the timescales extracted from the 3TM match well with the ones extracted from the experiments, hence corroborating the thermal origin of the dynamics observed.",0
"After the arrival of the visible pump pulse, the energy injected in the system is absorbed by the electrons and then transferred to the subset of strongly-coupled optical phonon modes (as expected from this picture, the dynamics does not depend on the pump photon energy, see the SM).",0
"Furthermore, additional simulations (reported in the SM) show that the dynamics of the CDW gap remains well described if any phonon energy between and meV is considered.",0

"By analyzing the power spectra of the contact maps, we find that smallkmodes capture most of the total contact-map variance.",0
"For most contact maps, S k approaches the total variance when k is small, indicating that most of the power is typically concentrated in the longest-wavelength modes.",0
This analysis highlights the dominant role of large-scale spatial structure in determining the total variance of monomer monomer contact frequencies.,0
"Motivated by this observation, we systematically train logistic regression models using the partial sums, S k , and compare their performance to models trained on the total contact-map variance, Var( C).",0
"The predictive ability of these models on the B22-mixed dataset quickly approaches that of the total contact-map variance, achieving statistically similar accuracy using only the lowest % of the wavenumbers (Figure 4B).",0
"Beyond k , the inclusion of higher-wavenumber modes offers statistically insignificant improvement, suggesting that, in general, long-wavelength modes contain essentially the same information for predicting phase separation as the total contact-map variance.",0
"Differences in spatial structure are reflected in the power spectra, which can differ among contact maps with identical total variance.",0
"In principle, this split-sum approach allows us to distinguish between contributions from long-wavelength versus short-wavelength variations when S k andS>k are treated as separate features in a logistic regression model.",0
"Moreover, since S k andS>k sum to the total variance, a split-sum logistic regression model is expected to perform at least as well as the total-variance model because logistic regression operates on linear combinations of the supplied features.",0
"AUC z-scores and error bars are defined as in Figure 4B. The split-sum models show statistically significant improvement relative to the total-variance model over a broad range of intermediate k values, achieving an average AUC of .",0
The consistent improvement of the split-sum models across this relatively broad range of k values further indicates that this finding is robust with respect to the partition wavenumber.,0
"For the B22= 400 3 dataset, splitting the power spectrum yields a notable increase in AUC relative to the total-variance model for k , resulting in an average AUC of .",0
"In the case of the B22= 1000 3dataset, where the total-variance model already performs exceptionally well ( ), a maximum split-sum AUC of . is reached at k .",0
"Overall, these observations indicate that distinguishing longand short-wavelength variations provides additional discriminatory power.",0
This result can be understood by a closer examination of the sequences whose classification changes between the split-sum and total-variance models.,0
"The wavenumber-ordered EV, EV(k) l, represents the fraction of the total Fourier power captured by the first lunique modes when ordered by increasing wavenumber.",0
"We contrast the wavenumber-ordered EV with an alternate ordering of the unique wavenumbers in terms of descending power values, EV(p) l.",0
"However, if finer-scale features make unexpectedly largecontributions to the total variance, then the EV(p) curve rises faster than the EV(k)curve, indicating a more complex power spectrum.",0
"We quantify these differences by measuring the mean-squared difference between EV(p)and EV(k), which we use to define the variance divergence index of a contact map, Variance divergence index = NkNkX l= EV(k) l EV(p) l , where Nkrepresents the number of unique wavenumbers in the power spectrum.",0
"For the sequences in this subset, the split-sum approach significantly outperforms the total-variance model in terms of classification accuracy, defined as the fraction of correct predictions made by the logistic regression model ( .",0
"By contrast, a control subset of sequences corresponding to the bottom percent of this statistic shows similar classification accuracy between the split-sum and total-variance models ( . ).",0
This comparison therefore indicates that the split-sum approach is particularly advantageous for classifying sequences whose contact maps are not described by long-wavelength features alone.,0
"This interpretation also explains why the optimal split-sum partition occurs below k (Figure ), since these wavenumbers contain most of the information about the total variance of the more common contact maps (Figure ).",0
"In summary, our analysis indicates that the variance and spatial distribution of monomer monomer contacts in two-chain simulations contains additional information beyond the effective two-body interaction characterized by B22 that is predictive of phase separation at higher concentrations.",0
"Although long-wavelength modes typically explain most of the contact-map variance, distinguishing contributions that arise from longversus short-wavelength variations can further improve the performance of logistic regression models, particularly for datasets containing sequences with unusually large contact-map power values at short wavelengths.",0
"E. Contact-map statistics are more discriminating than B22and Rgin a coarse-grained IDP model We now test the transferability of our contact-map analysis to a more complex, chemically specific heteropolymer model.",0
"As in the simpler copolymer model, incorporating contact-map statistics greatly improves the accuracy of logistic regression models trained on the IDP challenge set.",0
"In this setting, a bivariate model using B22and the contact-map variance as features does not substantially improve the AUC relative to the bivariate B22 Rgmodel.",0
"For this challenge set, constructing a -feature model by replacing the total contact-map variance with the two split-sum features does not yield statistically significant improvement over the -feature model.",0
"These findings suggest that in more complex heteropolymer models, such as the HPS IDP model, both the mean and the variance of the contact map provide important information for predicting phase separation.",0
"Thus, in general, we anticipate that multiple contact-map statistics will be needed to discriminate phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers in more chemically complex models.",0
The strong relationship between contact-map variance and copolymer phase separation is consistent with the hypothesis that uniform monomer monomer interactions promote collective interactions that lead to phase separation [].,0
"By contrast, more heterogeneous interactions reflected by a greater contact-map variance tend to create localized hot spots that stabilize finite-sized clusters but do not promote bulk condensation.",0
"This interpretation is further supported by our finding that long-wavelength modes are typically sufficient to reproduce the discriminatory power of the total contact-map variance, although distinguishing larger-scale interactions from finer-scale variations can improve the results for less common heteropolymer sequences with short-wavelength contact-map features.",0
"Moreover, our results demonstrate that contact-map statistics and power-spectrum analyses provide quantitative insights in situations where there is . . .",0

"By providing a unifying representation that utilizes physical observables as opposed to sequence features and is thus transferable across models of varying complexity, contact-map statistics could enhance machine learning methods that incorporate training data from models with different fidelities, ranging from atomistic to coarse-grained and field-theoretic simulations.",0
"Importantly, we note that incorporating contact-map statistics in addition to B22 into a phase-separation classifier comes at no significant computational cost.",0
"The challenge set sequences are nearly even split between aggregating and phase-separating sequences, as determined by the equation-of-state (EOS) method presented in Ref.",0
"For each sequence, we compute the PMF for two identical chains as described in Appendix A. From the PMF, u(r), we define an attractive well based on the range of center-of-mass distances rwhere u(r) lies within kBT of its minimum value.",0

Hydrodynamic model calculations incorporating a tilted initial energy density profile successfully capture this feature [].,0
"In recent years, extensive experimental studies have been conducted on the directed flow of identified hadrons across a broad range of collision energies [ , ].",0

"The time dependent magnetic field in the expanding QGP medium gives rise to a net electric current along the impact parameter direction due to Faraday induction, the Lorentz force, and the Coulomb force [, ].",0
"This induced electric field exerts a sideward force, pushing positively and negatively charged constituents of the QGP medium in opposite directions.",0
"As a result, this force manifests in the momentum-space distribution of the finally produced charged hadrons and can be quantified by measuring the v1between oppositely charged hadrons.",0
"The publicly available MUSIC code is utilized [, ], incorporating the evolution of net baryon density alongside the energy-momentum tensor.",0
We construct a three-dimensional smooth initial profileof energy and net baryon density by using the transverse distributions of participant and binary collision sources with a parameterized rapidity envelope profile.,0
"For the transverse energy deposition, we employ the two-component energy deposition model and adopt the tilted initial condition model to establish the initial three-dimensional energy density profile.",0
"The energy density at a constant proper time 0, which serves as the input for hydrodynamic evolution, follows the same form as used in our previous study in Ref.",0

"The free parameters in these rapidity envelopes are constrained by comparison with experimental data on the rapidity dependence of net-proton yields [, ].",0

"Instead, we use the MUSIC particlization and resonance decay routine, which provides a probability distribution for the invariant yield of each hadron species on a ( y, pT, ) grid.",0
"The last term represents the drag force, with being the drag coefficient, which counteracts the Lorentz force on a charged fluid cell of mass m, ensuring a stationary current.",0

"The centrality dependence of dv1/dy(p+ p) closely follows that of dv1/dy( ++ ), with the only difference arising from the mass disparity between protons and pions.",0
"For comparison, we also include the dv1/dyof the ( ++ ) combination, which likewise has no net conserved quantum number.",0
"The results indicate that the centrality dependence of dv1/dy(p+ p) follows a similar trend as dv1/dy( ++ ), though a clear hierarchy emerges due to the mass difference between protons and pions.",0

"Unlike spherical nuclei, where nucleon positions are the primary source of fluctuations, deformed nuclei also exhibit event-by-event fluctuations in their nuclear orientation.",0
"Moreover, the electromagnetic field s influence on the participant zone (i.e., the energy deposition region) varies from event to event, potentially introducing additional contributions to v1splitting.",0
"While the role of nuclear deformation in v1splitting is an intriguing topic for future studies, it is beyond the scope of this work.",0
"Here, we treat U+U as a deformed nucleus but construct smooth event-averaged profiles for participant density and initial energy deposition.",0
The model parameter values used for CB= to describe the rapidity dependence of charged particle and net-proton yields in Au+Au collisions at sNN= GeV are the same as those employed in our previous study [].,0
"To ensure consistency with these observations, we independently tune the energy tilt parameter mfor each collision system.",0
"Thus, we adopt a representative parameter set that provides a reasonable qualitative agreement with experimental observations.",0
"Our model, which includes both baryon diffusion and EM field effects with nonzero conductivity, shows qualitative agreement with experimental observations.",0

Panel (b): The transverse momentum (pT) dependence of the v1splitting between protons and antiprotons for the same collision systems at % centrality.",0
"However, for dv1/dy( + ), the model fails to reproduce the measurements, as incorporating the EM field effect drives the results further away from the experimental data.",0
"The correlation between the diffusion of different conserved charges could also impact the dv1/dyof K+ K and , as these particles differ in multiple conserved quantum numbers.",0
Future measurements and comparisons between model predictions and experimental data for these observables could provide valuable insights and open new avenues for exploration.,0

"Even though these algorithms do not guarantee to converge to the global optimum in a finite computational time, their application to our optimization problem is beneficial, since also local optima leading to appreciable improvements of the objective function are valuable from a financial point of view.",0
"A complete overview of optimization meta-heuristics is presented by Boussaid, Lepagnot, and Siarry , who distinguish between single solution based algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi ), which start with a single initial solution and move along a trajectory in the search space, and population based algorithms, which explore the search space using a population of different solutions evolving according to some rules, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA, Holland ), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO, Kennedy and Eberhart ).",0

"RATS is a versatile framework that leverages the parallelizable nature of the optimization problem with respect to the particle dimension and can be adapted to different trading portfolios, objective functions, and constraints.",0
"Additionally, its parameterization enables users to incorporate their financial insights and business views by directly shaping the structure of the eligible optimization strategies.",0
"We showcase two applications on a real trading portfolio typical of large banks, made of hundreds of financial instruments of different kinds, using real market data and tradable optimization instruments.",0
"In both cases, we seek an eligible optimization strategy that, when combined with the initial portfolio, optimizes a fractional, non-convex objective function over a non-convex set of eligible optimization strategies defined by the constraints.",0
"In addition, the set of constraints includes sensitivity limits; while the size of the eligible optimization strategy, its diversification, and the maximum nominal amount are handled directly via the proposed parameterization.",0
"In the first application, focused on a small-sized optimization strategy, RATS successfully identifies an optimal solution within the optimal solution set and demonstrates robustness to hyper-parameters tuning across all tested scenarios.",0
"In the second application, involving a large-sized optimization strategy, RATS markedly improves the cost-adjusted expected P&L and risk measures of the initial portfolio in every setting.",0
"At a high level, our work overcomes our inspiring paper by Kondratyev and Giorgidze and bridges the gap between complying with stringent regulatory requirements and implementing effective trading strategies that align with the objectives of both business units and risk management.",0
"In detail, Section specifies the setting and the building blocks of the risk-aware trading portfolio optimization problem.",0
"Then, instead of recomputing from scratch the portfolio features and risk measures by means of pricing functions at each iteration, we exploit the stored values during the optimization process thus reducing the computational burden (see Section ).",0
"We want to find the portfolio T,t optimizing f, which is obtained by adding to P,p a suitable eligible optimization strategy (EOS), denoted by H,h , complying with the specified constraints.",0
"Starting from Equation , the considered universe of UIs in RATPO, namely Usuch that T U , consists of the multiset union of two distinct sets.",0
"Definition (Eligible optimization strategy, EOS) .An eligible optimization strategy H,h is a tradable financial strategy at time t, complying with a set of specified constraints.",0
"The optimization variable in (P1), i.e., the EOS H,h , can be mapped into an integer vector as further discussed in Section .",0
"Thus, Problem (P1) can be viewed as an integer optimization problem with possibly nonconvex objective function and constraint set.",0
"Hence, the difficulty in solving (P1) boils down to the mathematical properties of the objective function in Equation and of the feasible solution set E. Establishing a general method that guarantees global convergence for the general RATPO problem is not feasible, and each specification of (P1) should be analyzed separately.",0
This method empirically proves to be effective and efficient in solving an instance of the RATPO problem involving the main risk measures and portfolio features used in daily risk management and trading activities (see Section ).,0
Risk-aware trading swarm algorithm Meta-heuristics represent general-purpose approaches for solving optimization problems.,0
"This approach allows risk managers and traders to specify arbitrarily complex objective functions of the form in Equation arising from the need to satisfy trading, risk management, and regulatory objectives.",0
"These algorithms may become trapped in local optima, making it challenging to assess their proximity to the global optimum.",0
"Nonetheless, for risk managers and traders who typically possess deep domain knowledge that can inform the optimization problem through constraints a consistent reduction in the objective function remains valuable.",0
"In PSO, each particle in the swarm explores positions, i.e., candidate solutions of the optimization problem, in an n-dimensional space.",0

"=xk i+vk+ i.(R1) By building on the key concepts of UEI and EOS, we develop a special version of PSO that leverages the parameterization H,h and enables parallel computation over the particles to efficiently solve the RATPO problem (P1).",0
"In general, assessing a feature of an optimization strategy involves evaluating a (nonlinear) function, which can be computationally expensive.",0
"Hence, at each iteration and for each particle, the computational cost of the optimization strategy feature evaluation is linear, as it requires m operations.",0
"The second term in Equation represents the weighted sum of the violations of the inequality and equality constraints, where j R+are penalty hyper-parameters.",0
"Henceforth, we refer to the fitness function evaluated at the optimization strategy entailed by a particle position xas f x. Recursion.",0
"After the initialization phase, RATS runs the recursion in (R1) to update the position and the velocity of the particle.",0
"At this point, RATS evaluates f xk+ i, and accordingly determines yk+ i. RATS runs the above steps in parallel over the particles, thus reducing the computational time, and allowing the user to choose larger values of npfor better exploration.",0
"In case Equation is not satisfied, RATS increases a counter kstall Nwhich keeps track of the number of stall iterations.",0
"RATS exits the recursion either (i)if the maximum number of iterations kmaxis reached, or (ii)if the global best position is not updated for a specified number of consecutive stall iterations kstall kmax stall, or(iii)if the fraction of particles exhibiting a personal best position equal to the global best one exceeds a concentration threshold p (,).",0

"Indeed, although the initial portfolio is made of hundreds of instruments of different kinds, the cardinality of the solution space is tractable (roughly of the order of ), and it is possible to find the optimal objective function value and the associated optimal solution set via brute force.",0
"Experimental setting Throughout the section, we use the diacritics e(tilde) when we refer to the quantities involved in the RATPO problem to emphasize that we are in a specific application setting.",0
"Starting from the features of the static UIs and exploiting Equation , we compute the initial portfolio value vP, itsP&L in the risk scenarios, and the sensitivities P,VP, P. Table provides vP, P,VP, and P. Additionally, the P&L distribution is given in Figure .",0
"We remark that the objective function in Equation is a particular case of the general objective in Equation , and that our approach is not limited to it.",0
"Given the linearity of the sensitivities in the vector of notional amounts as per Equation , the constraints in Equation are linear inequality constraints.",0
"Eligible optimization strategy Next, starting from Implementation of Definition , considering the sensitivity constraints in Equation , we can specify Definition in our setting.",0

"Then, within each triplet, we force the first two entries to be European options and the third to be either a stock or a stock index, depending on the nature of the -th underlying.",0
"Again, referring to the -th triplet within Equation , this means that the x ,1andx ,2correspond to those Hj with j= and j {c,p}.",0

"RATPO problem Starting from the objective function in Equation , considering Implementation of Definition and eEgiven as above, we pose the implementation of the general RATPO Problem we aim at solving in the applications in Sections and .",0
"Second, the EOS set eEis nonconvex as well due to the structure we impose on H (see paragraph Eligible optimization strategy above).",0
"Indeed, from a canonical optimization perspective, imposing this structure boils down to a group-wise cardinality constraint on the 0-norm8ofh, which is nonconvex.",0
"Although we do not exclude the possibility of deriving a convex surrogate of Equation (Wozabal, Hochreiter, and G. C. Pflug and refs.",0
"therein), and approximating with differentiable functions the (group-wise) cardinality constraint as proposed by Malek-Mohammadi et al. , we believe that such an investigation for deriving an alternative (gradient-based) optimization approach is beyond the scope of our empirical assessment, aimed at demonstrating the relevance of the RATPO problem and the general applicability of RATS given in Algorithm .",0
"Comparison with the Markowitz-like approach Before delving into the case studies, we relate our approach to a possible variation of the Markowitz mean-variance optimization framework, focusing on the challenges to be addressed for solving ( fP1) with a Markowitz-like approach.",0

"As shown in the paragraph Eligible optimization strategy in Section , our parameterization allows the user to easily specify a (complex) structure for both Handh.",0
"A third distinguishing feature concerns the direct applicability to objective functions of the form in Equation , i.e., general combinations of portfolio features and risk measures.",0
"Specifically, it would be necessary to investigate suitable convex and differentiable surrogates to tackle problems as (fP1), as is done, for example, in the successive convex approximation optimization scheme extensively discussed by Scutari and Sun .",0
"In fact, although sensitivity constraints in Equation are linear inequality constraints in the notional amounts (see Equation ), the group cardinality constraint entailed by the specified structure for Hwould result in a constraint on the 0-norm of groups of instruments associated with each underlying, where the groups must discriminate the type of instrument (see paragraph Eligible optimization strategy in Section ).",0
"Looking at the development of an M-approach for solving (fP1), a possible way to enforce such a structure in the solution would be to replace the entailed group cardinality constraint with a convex regularization term within the objective function based on the mixed 1/ 2-norm9of the vector of notional amounts.",0

Notice that P,p is the same in all case studies and settings.",0
"Conversely, due to our parametrization (see Equation ), the proposed approach easily allows a desired composition to be enforced in the solution.",0
"Small-sized eligible optimization strategy In this case, we consider a single underlying, the Euro Stoxx Index (.STOXX50E).",0
"Given the discussion in the paragraph Eligible optimization strategy of Section , since the underlying is a stock index, Hhas to be composed of only two vanilla options and one future written on the specified underlying.",0
"Since, in this case, the cardinality of the solution space is of the order of , we can compute the optimal value for the objective function in Equation via brute force.",0
"At this point, to compare the solution retrieved by RATS with the optimal one found via brute force, we solve (fP1)through RATS using np= particles, setting kmax= , and by investigating its behavior when both cpersandcsoctake value in the discretized interval ( .,.), where we move with a step size equal to ..",0
"The complete list of the RATS hyper-parameters values is given in Appendix A. We remark that, although the number of particles is large, the time required by RATS to perform the allowed maximum number of iterations for solving (fP1) is only of the order of seconds.",0
"Within each plot, we represent with a star the case in which our algorithm returns a solution belonging to the optimal solution set eE of the corresponding RATPO problem, i.e., a solution equivalent to that found via brute force.",0

The starting point is an independent particles Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian that preserves the translation symmetry of the crystal but breaks Time-Reversal (TR) symmetry.,0
"In contrast to the linear response approach, the converse method bypasses the perturbation of the Hamiltonian: the spin-orbit coupling (SO) term is explicitly incorporated into the selfconsistent field calculations, while the spin other orbit (SOO) term, that in general gives a small contribution to the g-tensor, is neglected.",0

"We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key components: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the local cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that steers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable global quantities.",0
"By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex setups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks.",0
The comprehensive overview provided in the surveys [] [] discusses the most popular setups and the algorithms used to address these challenges.,0
"The mentioned surveys do not include the so-called aggregative optimization framework which is particularly suited to model tasks arising in cooperative robotics, see the recent tutorial [].",0
"Other works on distributed aggregative optimization include [] in which a distributed method based on the Franke-Wolfe update is proposed, and [], [] in which momentum based algorithms are proposed.",0
Authors in [] propose a continuous time algorithm with non-uniform gradient gains which only requires the sign of relative state information between agents neighbors.,0
Aggregative optimization scenarios with uncertain environments have been explored in [] where the distributed scheme proposed in [] is enhanced with a Recursive Least Square (RLS) method estimating the unknown cost via feedback from the users.,0
Unknown environments as those mentioned above are particularly interesting in the context of the so-called personalized optimization frameworks.,0
"In this field, the goal is to minimize cost functions given by the sum of a known part, named engineering function and related to measurable quantities (e.g., time or energy), and an unknown part representing the user s (dis)satisfaction with the current solution.",0
"Since synthetic models based on human preferences often perform well only on average, failing to address the unique preferences of individual users, personalized optimization emphasizes data-driven strategies.",0

"In this paper, we introduce DEep-Learning aggregative TrAcking (DELTA), a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme for aggregative problems.",0
"DELTA operates on a single timescale and integrates three core components: (i) a learning-oriented module, (ii) an optimization-oriented routine, and (iii) a tracking-oriented mechanism.",0
The learning-oriented component uses local neural networks to asymptotically estimate the correct costs (and their gradients) in a data-driven fashion.,0
"Specifically, each neural network employs only a single cost evaluation per iteration taken in the neighborhood of the current local estimates, making the method suitable for scenarios where cost evaluations are limited, such as when they are derived from human or physical sensors.",0
"We analyze DELTA using tools from system theory based on timescale separation and averaging theory to formally prove that, in strongly convex settings, the algorithm linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks.",0
"However, in that version, the algorithm is significantly simpler, as it requires an inner-loop process to reconstruct the unknown cost function at each iteration using multiple samples and an arbitrary number of inner iterations.",0
"Namely, we want to design an algorithm in which each agent only uses local information and exchanges data with its neighbors.",0

"Once the learning capabilities of the considered neural networks have been enforced, we are ready to formalize the learning mechanism embedded in DELTA.",0
"We point out that the implementation of a standard gradient algorithm for solving problem would require a number of samples that increases with the iteration counter k, thus violating Assumption (one sample per iteration) and resulting computationally expensive.",0
"We conclude this section by introducing :Rn RNd Rm Rto compactly represent the global cost addressed by the neural networks in a decoupled manner, namely (x, s, ):=NX i=1 i(xi, si, i), where s:=col( s1, . . .",0

"In Section IV-A , we reformulate DELTA and, then, we consider an associated nominal version in which the finite accuracy of the neural networks (see Assumption ) is fictitiously compensated.",0
"This interpretation allows us to use the stability properties of the nominal system (step )) to establish those of the original one, thereby providing the proof of Theorem .",0
"Now, we introduce the nominal version of , i.e., an auxiliary system in which the finite accuracy of the neural networks (see Assumption ) is suitably compensated by adding some fictitious terms.",0

HD is one of the best characterised protoplanetary disks that has been proposed to host at least four giant planets on wide orbits as well as a massive planetesimal disk.,0
"We perform high-resolution n-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of planetesimals embedded in HD s protoplanetary disk across and after the formation of its giant planets, accounting for the uncertainty on both the disk and planetary masses as well as for the e ffects of aerodynamic drag of the disk gas and the gas gravity.",0
"To quantify the impact probabilities with existing and possible undiscovered planetary bodies, we process the output of the n-body simulations with well-tested statistical collisional algorithms from the study of the asteroid belt.",0
"The collisional enrichment of the atmospheres of giant planets can alter or mask the signatures of their formation environments, but can provide independent constraints on the disk mass.",0
"While the dominant mechanism responsible for the primordial inward transport of volatiles and organics in the Solar System is still a matter of debate (e.g. whether it was controlled by Jupiter s mass growth alone or mainly sculpted by its migration, see Turrini et al. 2018a; O Brien et al.",0
"Even in the case of young planetary systems unaltered by chaos (e.g. Damasso et al. ; Mantovan et al. 2024a,b), the degeneracy in the initial conditions caused by the current lack of constraints on the disk-driven migration of their planets hinders this kind of studies.",0
"In parallel, population studies of protoplanetary disks across di fferent star forming regions revealed the possible resurgence of their dust abundance at ages of Myr (Testi et al. ), which suggests that many of them could be host to both giant planets and massive planetesimal disks whose dynamical and collisional interactions replenish the disk dust through more intense versions of the collisional cascades that shape debris disks (Bernab et al. ).",0
The planet formation study by Turrini et al. revealed that both the presence and location of this enhanced dust region are naturally explained by the collisional erosion of planetesimals if HD s disk hosts an extended and massive population of exocomets dynamically excited by giant planets.,0
"The same study highlighted how part of the exocometary population could penetrate the innermost au of the protoplanetary disk, although the amount of delivered mass was not quantified, and how a large fraction of the excited planetesimals could be ejected into interstellar space (Turrini et al. ).",0
The setup of the n-body simulations builds on the one described in Turrini et al. accounting for the current constraints on the disk gas mass from Booth et al.,0
"Specifically, we consider two di fferent disk gas masses and two sets of planetary masses for a total of four combinations of planetary and disk parameters (see Table ).",0
"This choice has no impact on the results of the study as the changes in the masses and the distances within HD s system would be limited to about %, therefore significantly smaller than the observational uncertainties on the relevant values.",0
"with ALMA using13C17O, where the total gas mass is M , and a low disk mass (LDM) scenario based on the gas mass estimates of Isella et al.",0
"The disk gas mass is assumed to be in steady state and does not decline over time across the simulations, a reasonable approximation given that the mass of gas accreted by the giant planets amounts at most to % of the disk mass (i.e. the combination of smallest disk mass and highest planetary masses) and the observed high mass-loss rates due to molecular wind have been interpreted as the onset of the disk dispersal phase (Klaassen et al. ).",0
"For the planetary masses, we consider again a low planetary mass (LPM) scenario, where the masses of the three inner giant planets are from Liu et al.",0
"and that of the outermost giant planet from Pinte et al. , and a high planetary mass (HPM) scenario, where the masses of the three inner giant planets are from Teague et al.",0
In the LPM scenario the masses originally estimated by Liu et al. based on the radial extensions of the gaps in the disk dust distribution have been rescaled to the DR2 stellar distance measured by GAIA (BailerJones et al. ).,0
"The n-body simulations model the dynamical evolution of a disk of planetesimals embedded within HD s gaseous disk under the e ffects of the mass growth of the four forming giant planets, of the aerodynamic drag by the disk gas and of the disk gravity.",0
"(, ), planetesimals are modelled as test particles possessing inertial mass and no gravitational mass, meaning that the test particles are a ffected by the disk gas but do not influence each other nor the giant planets.",0

"As in Turrini et al. , we model the formation of HD s four giant planets as occurring in situ, i.e. without them undergoing orbital migration while growing in mass.",0
"We set the spatial density of planetesimals in the N-body simulations to particles /au, with the inner edge of the planetesimal disk at au and the outer edge at au (see Turrini et al.",0
"To quantify how the solid mass is redistributed across the protoplanetary disk by the appearance of the four giant planets, we treated each test particle in the N-body simulations as a swarm of real planetesimals.",0
"Booth et al. ; Mulders et al. ), particularly in light of the high mass loss (Klaassen et al. ) and gas accretion rate (Wichittanakom et al. ) presently experienced by this protoplanetary disk, we adopt the following simplified approach.",0
"The cumulative mass of each swarm is computed integrating the adopted disk gas density profile over a ring au wide centred on the initial orbit of the impacting particle, and multiplying the resulting gas mass by the local solid-to-gas ratio.",0
"First row: High Disk Mass High Planetary Mass; Second row: High Disk Mass Low Planetary Mass; Third row: Low Disk High Planetary Mass; Fourth row: Low Disk Mass Low Planetary Mass carbon monoxide, and reaches times the disk metallicity for planetesimals formed at temperatures below K, i.e. beyond the carbon monoxide snowline.",0
Then the formation region of the impacting particles is used to quantify the mass of the swarm of planetesimals they represent based on the methods described above.,0
"To investigate the collisional implications of the dynamical transport of planetesimals to the inner regions of the protoplanetary disk, we alsocompute the impact probabilities and velocities among the particles that originate within the inner unperturbed planetesimal disk and those originating from the outer excited planetesimal disk using the well-tested statistical collisional methods developed for the study of the asteroid belt (Wetherill ; Farinella & Davis ; O Brien & Sykes ).",0
"The resulting values are used to estimate the accretional fluxes of impactors on Article number, page of A&A proofs: manuscript no.",0
"The two populations remain well separated during the first temporal phase that extends until all four giant planets reach their current masses, i.e. before Myr in our simulations.",0
In this phase we can see a di fference in the level of global dynamical excitation between high mass and low mass disks.,0
"The outermost giant planet, due to its faster formation and larger final mass, quickly becomes more e fficient in scattering planetesimals rather than accreting them and undergoes no impacts during the simulations. .",0
"In the HDM-HPM scenario the giant planets can implant planetesimals between au and au with similar e fficiencies (Table ), while their less massive counterparts in the HDM-LPM scenario are three times less e fficient in implanting planetesimals between and au than between and au (Table ).",0
"In the LDM scenarios the most enriched ring is that between and au, which sees its mass increased by % and % in the HPM and LPM scenarios, respectively.",0
The comparison of the implantation e fficiencies in the di fferent orbital regions as a function of the disk and planetary masses is shown in Fig. .,0
"Specifically, the solid lines in Fig. show the ratios betweenthe implantation e fficiencies for the two di fferent sets of planetary masses while keeping the disk mass constant, while the dashed lines show the ratios for the two di fferent disk masses while keeping the planetary masses constant.",0
"As can be immediately seen from the slopes of the curves in Fig. , increasing the disk mass enhances the implantation e fficiency in the part of the inner disk closer to the giant planets, while increasing the planetary masses enhances the implantation e fficiency closer to the host star.",0
"The higher abundance of N in the implanted planetesimals ( berg & Bergin ) makes the enrichment in Article number, page of A&A proofs: manuscript no.",0
"Finally, the mass implanted between and au in the HDM scenario and between and au in the LDM scenario is comparable in magnitude or greater than that estimated for the late veneer that a ffected the planetary bodies in the asteroid belt and the inner Solar System (see Day et al. , ; Turrini et al. 2018a, and references therein). .",0
"Since the dynamical injection process depends only on the orbital eccentricity of the excited planetesimals, it involves significantly more bodies than the implantation process and is particularly e fficient with the highest planetary masses considered here (see Table ).",0
"While lower disk masses result in decreased damping e fficiency of gas drag and should allow for the injection of a larger population of high eccentricity planetesimals, in Table we observe this behaviour only with the HPM cases.",0
"The orange color identifies the high-mass disk when comparing the e fficiencies of the HPM and LPM scenarios, and the high-mass planets when comparing the e fficiencies of the HDM and LDM scenarios.",0
"Increasing the disk mass enhances the implantation e fficiency in the part of the inner disk closer to the giant planets, while increasing the planetary masses enhances the implantation e fficiency closer to the host star.",0
The orbital region between and au is crossed by a mass flux of planetesimals representing -% of the local mass of planetesimals.,0
"In the HDM-HPM scenario the mass of injected planetesimals reaches up to % of the local planetesimal population, while in all other scenarios the injected mass is always less than this value (see Table ).",0
"In particular, Zhang et al. postulate that such a ring can be the result of a new planet with mass ranging between M Jembedded in the disk.",0
"In order to calculate the numbers of potential impacts on these assumed targets, we focused on the orbital architectures of the planetesimal disks in the final snapshot of our simulations and computed the intrinsic impact probability (see Sect.",0
We focused on six impact scenarios based on templates from both the Solar System1and exoplanets2spanning the mass range from small planetary embryos to fully-formed massive planets.,0
"Specifically, we assumed targets with Lunar-like ( M ), Earth-like ( M ), Neptune-like ( M ) and Jupiterlike ( M ) masses as well as targets modelled after the superEarth GJ 486b (M t= M , Rt= R , vesc= km /s) and the mini-Neptune TOI-1260b (M t= M , Rt= R , vesc= km/s), based on the classification from Fulton et al. .",0
"Ni=Pi (Rt,e f f+Rpl) t Npl where N iis the number of impacts on the target body, P iis the intrinsic impact probability (see Sect.",0
The resulting numbers of impacts were multiplied by the inertial mass of the colliding planetesimals and normalised depending on the mass of the target body.,0
"In the case of the MiniNeptune-like, Neptune-like and Jupiter-like targets, the mass flux of impactors is normalised to the mass of heavy elements contained in an atmospheric shell of solar metallicity accounting for % of the target mass following Turrini et al. .",0

"As reference value to compare the magnitude of the resulting late accretion with Solar System analogues, we adopt the water mass fraction estimated for the Earth ( 4planetary masses, Morbidelli et al. ).",0
"We need to emphasise, however, that Earth s water enrichment does not translate into an unequivocal late accretion mass value due to the uncertainty on the source of Earth s water.",0
"Specifically, Earth s water enrichment requires the accretion of a mass of planetesimals twice as large if these planetesimals are cometary in nature and have half their mass as water ice (e.g. Turrini et al. 2018b, and references therein).",0
"If the source of Earth s waterwas instead linked to carbonaceous asteroids, whose water content amounts to about % in mass (e.g. Turrini et al. 2018b, and references therein), the mass of planetesimals required to produce Earth s water abundance would be ten times as large.",0
"The highest enrichments are reached by target planets beyond au in the HPM scenarios and beyond au in the LPM scenarios, with the magnitude of the enrichment increasing proportionally to the gravitational cross-section of the target planet (e.g. SuperEarths experience higher enrichments than Earth-like and Lunarlike targets).",0
"Also in the case of the three more massive targets (right panels in Fig. ), the larger gravitational cross-section of the Jupiterlike targets allows for a greater enrichment than their Neptunelike and mini-Neptune counterparts.",0
"In the LDM scenarios the atmospheres of these massive planets are characterised by mostly solar abundances (see Fig. ), with only Jupiter-like target showing limited super-solar enrichments.",0
"Collisional enrichment and contamination of the known giant planets In parallel to the enrichment and contamination of possible undiscovered inner planets, we investigated the e ffects the excited planetesimals have on the very giant planets embedded in the gaps of HD s disk that are at the origin of their dyplanetesimals by a crustal mass amounting to % the planetary mass, by analogy with the case of the Earth adopting an average crustal thickness of km and an average crustal density of kg /m3(Christensen & Mooney ).",0
"Across our simulations, the first three planets (b, c & d) are hit by a flux of impactors ranging from a few hundred to a couple of thousand test particles.",0
"The impacting particles originated at distances spanning the locations of the H 2S, CH , CO and N 2snowlines, located at semimajor distances of about , , , and au for the reconstructed temperature profile of HD s disk midplane (see Fig. ), and enrich the forming giant planets with heavy elements.",0
"In the LDM scenarios, on the other hand, none of the planets accretes more that the equivalent of an Earth mass of planetesimals, meaning that the enrichment e ffect is negligible when assuming a solar metallicity for HD s host star and its disk.",0
"Planet e su ffers no impact in all scenarios, as its faster formation timescale and larger mass make it more e fficient in scattering the planetesimals that undergo close encounters with it than in accreting them.",0
"We focused on the contamination a ffecting the outermost % of the planetary mass, assumed to represent the molecular gas shell (Turrini et al. ), hence on the impacts occurring after Myr since the onset of the runaway gas accretion (or, equivalently, Myr since the beginning of the growth process in our simulations).",0
"The above results, together with those discussed in Sect. , highlight how the interplay between the formation process of multi-planet systems and the protoplanetary disks in which they are embedded can play a marked role in altering the primordial compositional signatures of the native environments in the planetary atmospheres, even in absence of orbital migration, and how collisional contamination is an important process in shaping multi-planet systems born in massive disks. .",0
"About half as many planetesimals as those ejected into interstellar space are scattered into an extended disk beyond Article number, page of A&A proofs: manuscript no.",0
"The key factor in controlling the ejection e fficiency is the mass of the planets (see Table ): in the HPM scenarios about one fourth of the planetesimals initially present in the disk are ejected, while in the LPM scenarios this value drops to about one tenth.",0
"The disk mass has a smaller impact on the ejection e fficiency driven by the exciting e ffect of the disk gravity, which proves dominant with respect to the damping e ffect of gas drag.",0
"Specifically, the constructive interplay between the planetary perturbations and the disk gravity leads to slightly higher ejection e fficiencies in the high disk mass scenarios (see Table ).",0
"The impact of the disk gravity is more pronounced in the LPM scenarios, where the fractional increase in ejection e fficiency when moving from the low disk mass to the high disk mass is four times larger than in the case of the HPM scenarios (% instead of %).",0
In Figure we show how the ejection e fficiency and the source regions of the ejected planetesimals vary as a function of the disk and planetary masses.,0
The regions experiencing the highest ejection rates for all combinations of disk and planetary masses are those between the second and third and between the third and fourth giant planets.,0
"Under the assumptions adopted for the computation of the mass of the planetesimal disks discussed in Section , we find that the LDM scenarios can eject into the interstellar space between and M .",0
"Note, however, that these values provide only general indications of the e fficiency of the process in producing interstellar objects, as we do not know the original mass and distribution of solids nor the planetesimal formation e fficiency across the disk.",0
"In the case of solid planets, the only impact on our results would be the reduction of the enrichment by a factor equal to the ratio between the mass in pebbles and the total mass of solids (pebbles and planetesimals) in the disk. .",0
"This enrichment in astrobiologically-important elements can play a significant role in shaping HD s habitable zone, where the probability that planetesimals experienced major volatile loss during their geophysical evolution is high (see Sect.",0
"Considering the physical properties of a Main Sequence star with the same mass and metallicity (solar) as HD , the habitability zone can expand to around au (see Figure from Danchi & Lopez ).",0
"HD163296 In two of our simulated scenarios (HDM HPM and LDM HPM) we find that as much as % of the mass contained in the innermost ring (au) is made up of planetesimals rich in N, C and O that formed at distances greater than au.",0
"Specifically, when the growing planets reach the so-called pebble isolation mass, dense rings of pebbles accumulate at the pressure bumps outside each planet orbit (Morbidelli & Nesvorny ; Lambrechts & Johansen ).",0
"These pebbledense rings provide favourable sites for forming planetesimals by streaming instability (Johansen & Lambrechts ) and can continue to grow in mass until an outer planet reaches its pebble isolation mass, blocking the incoming flux of pebbles, or the gas begins to dissipate typically within to Myr (Hern ndez et al.",0
"This third wave of contaminating bodies is expected to extend in time the impacting flux on existing planets, increasing their budget of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.",0
"In parallel, Turrini et al. showed how the collisional cascade triggered by excited planetesimals can produce tens of Earth masses of dust and explain the abundant dust population observed inward of HD s first giant planet (Isella et al. ).",0
"The study of the ejecta size distribution after Hayabusa s impact experiment on asteroid Ryugu point to the ejected dust particles ranging in size from one mm to several decimetres, with a characteristic size of about one cm (Wada et al. ).",0
We explored four end-member scenarios that span the possible combinations of the estimated disk and planetary masses and allow us to assess the impact of these physical parameters on the dynamical evolution of the system as a whole.,0
"The intensity of the dynamical excitation process proves to be controlled by the masses of the giant planets yet we find that the disk mass has smaller but non-negligible e ffects, with the excitation e ffect of the disk gas proving more important than the damping one of gas drag in the outer disk regions.",0
"The dynamical excitation of the planetesimal disk results in the creation of a massive population of exo-comets that transports volatile elements to the inner disk regions, enriching existing planets and their atmospheres in these astrobiologically important elements, and produces a large population of interstellar planetary objects.",0
"Implantation can increase the local mass of the a ffected ring up to %, while injection can temporarily increase it up to %.",0
Higher planetary masses result in excited planetesimals penetrating deeper into the inner disk and allow for their implantation in the innermost au.,0
"Higher disk masses enhance the excitation in the outer disk but the stronger gas drag they exert circularises the orbits farther away from the star, favouring the region between and au in HD s case. .",0
"For higherdisk masses, solid planets spanning from lunar to super-Earth masses and residing beyond au are enriched to higher or comparable levels than the Earth, while for lower disk masses the enrichment is on average an order of magnitude smaller.",0
Giant planets ranging from sub-Neptunian to Jovian masses and residing in the same orbital region can have their atmospheres enriched from two to nine times the stellar metallicity proportionally to their mass. .,0
"For the higher disk masses, planetesimal accretion significantly enhances the bulk metallicity of planets b and c and moderately that of planet d.",0
"Building on the above findings, we can draw the following global implications for the evolution of protoplanetary disks hosting young massive planets: .",0
"This can prolong the temporal window available to form planets by pebble accretion, bypassing the barrier e ffect of existing massive planets to the inward drift of the pebbles from the outer disk. .",0
"The dependence of the collisional enrichment on the disk mass can, in principle, put further constraints on the disk mass.",0
"Specifically, signatures of planetesimal impacts, like the presence of dust or refractory elements in the atmospheres of giant planets, would point to high disk masses while their absence would favour lower disk masses.",0
"Overall the picture depicted by our results indicates that studies aimed to constrain the formation history of planets through their atmospheric characterisation need to account for the global architecture of the host planetary system, as the presence of massive planets can imply that the present day atmospheric signatures are not a reflection of the primordial ones.",0

We present an electrically-small Rydberg atom electric field sensor with the ability to extract the three-dimensional k-vector of an elliptically polarized radio frequency (rf) field.,0
Our method uses a field vector measurement at a single point in space and is thus compatible with a sensor volume that is arbitrarily small compared to the carrier wavelength.,0
"However, measuring the electric field vector at a single point in space is insufficient to fully characterize an electromagnetic wave.",0
"To determine the k-vector of an incoming linearlypolarized plane wave, which is defined to be perpendicular to the wavefronts of the wave, one must either make a spatially-extended measurement, make simultaneous measurements of the electric and magnetic field vectors [], or measure the momentum vector of the wave for example through particle recoil [].",0
"This restriction is relaxed for elliptically-polarized plane waves where the electric field vector traces out an ellipse, and the k-vector is constrained to be normal to this ellipse.",0
"Thus, for elliptically-polarized plane waves the k-vector can be determined up to a sign by measuring the electric field vector at a single point in space.",0
"In this work, we demonstrate an electricallysmall quantum sensor that measures the k-vector for peter.k.elgee.ctr@army.milelliptically-polarized rf fields.",0
"Building off our previous development of a Rydberg atom polarimeter [], we extract the three-dimensional k-vector by measuring the polarization ellipse with a single optical probe measurement.",0
"This method allows the sensor to be arbitrarily small relative to the carrier wavelength, and thus operates down to quasi-DC fields.",0
"We quantitatively assess the k-vector measurement, the impact of interaction region size relative to the rf wavelength, and the dependence of the accuracy and precision of the measurement on the ellipticity of the input field.",0
The threedimensional and inherently electrically-small nature of our method opens up new possibilities in sub-wavelength field characterization and alternatives to extended apertures or arrays in radar systems or radio frequency telescopes as in most cases the k-vector corresponds to the propagation direction of the wave.,0
.85Rb atoms in a vapor cell are excited to a Rydberg state through a two-photon process with probe and coupling lasers where they become sensitive to a signal rf field (Sig) resonant with an atomic transition between Rydberg states.,0
"[physics.atom-ph] Mar the azimuthal ( ), and polar ( ) angles of the rf horn antenna that transmits the signal field as shown in Fig. .",0
"This configuration keeps the interaction region smaller than the rf wavelength, and suppresses the signal averaging effect discussed later.",0
"For a plane wave, the k-vector must be orthogonal to the field vector at all times, and we can extract it up to a sign from the cross product of v1and v2 k= v1 v2 | v1|| v2|.",0
"The average correction parameter matrix Ais A= .028e1..034e0. .050e0..948e .020e0. .003e0..017e .000e0. where the diagonal elements primarily represent corrections to the LO amplitudes and phases, and the offdiagonal elements represent reflection amplitudes and phases.",0
"Over the measured k-vectors, the elements of the parameter matrix Avary with standard deviations in amplitude ( |A|) and phase ( ) respectively of |A|= . . . . .",0
"When the k-vector of the signal field is not aligned withthek-vector of a particular LO, and the interaction region is an appreciable fraction of the carrier wavelength, the phase of the respective heterodyne beat will vary in space.",0
"In our system, the optical beams are negligibly small relative to the carrier wavelength with a ratio of , so only the averaging along the optical axis ( z) is significant.",0
"Along this axis, the phase gradient of the beat has a wavelength ( p) given by p= 0/|cos( )| where 0is the wavelength of the rf carrier.",0
"We evaluate this averaging effect by testing the system with three different vapor cell lengths ( cm, cm, and cm), and two different carrier wavelengths ( cm and cm).",0
"Although not shown here, the averaging effect looks similar in |bx|/|Sigx|and |by|/|Sigy|for the longer wavelength 0= cm.",0
These data confirm that the solid angle over which the k-vector can be measured increases as the interaction region becomes small relative to the carrier wavelength.,0
"In general, there will be a trade-off between absolute sensitivity, which typically improves with interaction volume through increased atom number, and the sensor s field a view.",0
The effect of averaging over the interaction region on the ratio of the measured beat amplitude |bz|to the expected zsignal projection Sigzas a function of for a variety of cell lengths and carrier wavelengths.,0
"We also investigate the statistical error per k-vector by splitting the data trace of each measurement into time bins, each ms long, extracting the standard deviation in the and measurements, and normalizing to the integration time.",0
"The statistical noise here corresponds to a field sensitivity of 58 V/m Hz, which is similar to the sensitivity of the previous experimental iteration [].",0
Our sensor employs the power of rf heterodyne measurements in Rydberg atom electric field sensors to extract the k-vector in three dimensions with a single measurement in a platform that can be arbitrarily electrically small.,0

"Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra.",0
This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions.,0
"Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to further refine and parameterize a golden sample of WDMS candidates through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting.",0
"It is well established that the binary fraction of stars is highly dependent on the stellar mass, ranging from % for M-type stars (Winters et al. ) to % for O and B-type stars (Sana et al.",0
"The more massive star in the pair will evolve faster and, if it is a low-to-intermediate-mass star ( 8M ), it will eventually become a white dwarf (WD, Iben et al. ) forming a WD plus main-sequence (MS) star binary (hereafter, WDMS).",0
"Given the very predictable cooling age of the WDs, WDMS binary pairsare excellent cosmic clocks that have been used to study fundamental astrophysical parameterizations such as the age metallicity relation (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2021a), the initial -to -final mass (Zhao et al. ), and the mass-radius relation (Raddi et al. ).",0
"Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of automatically identifying WDMS binaries using machine learning techniques with promising accuracy (around % using Random Forest; see Echeverry et al. ), and successfully detecting candidates in open clusters with Support Vector Machines (SVM; Grondin et al. ).",0
"Recently, we have used Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs; Kohonen ), an unsupervised neural network-based algorithm to find polluted WD candidates based on Gaia XP spectra (P erez-Couto et al. ).",0
"Therefore, any secondary companion to a WD in the sample is expected to be a low-mass, latetype M dwarf or even a brown dwarf, as its presence is not expected to significantly affect the photometry or astrometry of the WD.",0
"In particular, the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution An-alyzier (VOSA1, Bayo et al. ) allowed RebassaMansergas et al.",0
"Instead of flux units per wavelength unit, each XP spectrum is given as an array of coefficients of a series of Hermite basis functions ( for BP and for RP).",0
"Given the infeasibility of visually inspecting such an extensive data set, numerous studies have employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to mine the data in the search and classification of WD (Garc a-Zamora et al.",0
"Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs; Kohonen ), is an unsupervised neural network-based algorithm that combines either dimensionality reduction to project the XP coefficients in a two-dimensional grid map and cluster to group similar elements together in the same neuron .",0
"This approach ensures that any detected companion has low emission, as the WD dominates, making 1http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/vosa/ very low-mass companions, such as M stars or brown dwarfs, the most likely candidates.",0
"This probability is determined using a reference dataset of , spectroscopically confirmed WDs and contaminants identified through visual inspection in the SDSS.",0
"The definition of contaminant used in Gentile-Fusillo et al. included WDMS binaries, and hence a probability filter of, for instance, PWD>, would exclude the majority of contaminants such as QSOs or Galaxies, but also most of the WDMS we aim to discover.",0
"As a baseline, we rely on the Montreal White Dwarf Database2(MWDD), which is so far the most complete catalog of WDs based on more than references from the literature (Dufour et al. ), containing information about each WD such as its spectral type or binarity.",0

"Self-Organizing Maps While most unsupervised machine learning techniques are either utilized for dimensionality reduction (e.g. tSNE, UMAP) or clustering (e.g. K-means, DBSCAN), SOMs integrate both applications within a single neural network-based algorithm.",0
"Furthermore, the clustering of neurons into closed groups allows the accurate delineation and classification of these populations.",0
"Subsequently, an iterative process updates the weights at a given learning rate ( h0) that decrease over time, and following a neighborhood function that ensures the preservation of the topology.",0
"On the other hand, the F1-score is defined as the harmonic mean of the precision4and the recall5of the classification, and calculated with the equation : F1= Precision Recall Precision + Recall.",0
"It is important to recognize that the effectiveness of this approach, like other distance-based algorithms, is strongly tied to the scale of the features involved (here, the XP coefficients).",0
"In simple terms, it provides the probability of the algorithm to be correct when assigning a class to a source, 5The recall is computed as TP/(TP+FN), with FNbeing the number of False Negatives.",0
"Using this labeling procedure, we can compute a confusion matrix (see Figure ), as well as precision and recall metrics (see Table ) to validate our methodology.",0
"The confusion matrix, C, has as rows the true labels (that is, those used as a reference, here MWDD combined with SDSS and LAMOST) and as columns the predicted labels (those assigned after the SOM clustering plus the labeling procedure described above).",0
"In Figure we show the confusion matrix with the numbers described above in each cell, and below them the same number normalized by columns, which is equivalent to the precision.",0
"Although both z3,0andz4,0contain WDMS binaries, they are different neurons which, based on the conservation of the topology order, suggests that there is some difference between their populations.",0
"Furthermore, to assess the reliability of our morphological clustering, we have compared the median spectra of the cool (hot) WDMS binary candidates 6https://gaia-dpci.github.io/GaiaXPy-website/with that of the cool (hot) confirmed WDMS binaries in each neuron.",0
This VO tool enables us to gather photometric data from major multi-wavelength astronomical surveys and to compile these data into an observational SED (Bayo et al. ).,0

"Moreover, we discarded any point in the overall photometry with a relative error for the flux greater than %, and retained only those sources with at least a point from 2MASS and CatWISE2020 photometry, to ensure NIR coverage.",0
"However,we consider it crucial if we want to obtain a reliable SED fit since the low-mass MS companions are expected to have their emission peak in the NIR.",0
"This discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that they only used the G,GBP, and GRPcolors to fit their atmospheric models while we used a significantly larger set of photometric points spanning a wider wavelength range from the UV (where the emission peak in WDs is located) to the NIR.",0

"There are only three sources out of the convex hull of the WD evolutionary tracks, indicating that they may possess masses lower than .2M .",0
"As a result, we found that the remaining WD companions have masses ranging from to M , with a median, 25th, and 75th percentile of .+ M , thus revealing a population of very-low-mass WDs.",0
"Regarding to the MS companions, we estimated their masses ( MMS) by means of a cubic spline interpolation of their Teffthrough the Pecaut & Mamajek tables.",0

"Finally, we have compared the WD mass, radius, and Teffof both companions of our golden WDMS candidates with those obtained in RM21 and N24, as shown in Figure .",0
"As can be seen, WDs in our sample are slightly hotter than those in N24 and RM21, respectively, although their masses and radii are quite similar to those in RM21 thus indicating that our sample belongs to a younger WD population.",0

Thespatialarrangementofgatesintheintegrablecircuitsconsidered herein can break the space-reflection symmetry even when Uitself is symmetric.,0
We explain this within a quasiparticle picture which suggests that a nonzero drift necessitates gates acting on distinct degrees of freedom.,0

"Similar to continuous-time integrable models, the large-scale dynamics of Yang-Baxterintegrable quantum circuits can be described within the framework of generalized hydrodynamics [ ].",0
A common feature of quantum circuits exhibiting asymmetric spreading of correlations is the presence of gates that explicitly break the space-reflection symmetry by acting on distinct degrees of freedom [].,0
This motivates the investigation of integrable quantum circuits in which gates are not arranged in the standard brickwork fashion such circuits have been identified and classified according to their spectral characteristics and space-time symmetries in Ref.,0
"Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamic states of integrable circuits and derive the ingredients for the hydrodynamic description of the dynamical spin susceptibility.",0
This allows us to investigate how the circuit geometry affects the spin transport in such discrete-spacetime dynamical systems.,0
[] that all homogeneous brickwork circuits composed of U-invariant nearest-neighbour unitary gates are integrable (see also Refs.,0

"In it, the Authors describe how to construct integrable Floquet circuits in which the space and time periods are the same, and the system length is their multiple.",0
Background and outline The general setting of this work are integrable time-periodic quantum circuits composed of twoqubit nearest-neighbour gates.,0

The latter classifies all circuits in which a fixed two-site gate Uis applied on all nearest-neighbour pairs of qubits exactly once per period.,0
"[] it was shown that, for a given system size L, there always exist at most L 1circuits with different spectra (quasienergies): all circuits can be sorted in at most L spectral equivalence classes (SECs).",0
"Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries We will explicitly show that, for a proper choice of U, all circuit geometries classified in Ref.",0
The crucial role is played by quantum gates that solve the Yang-Baxter equation a relation which underpins the integrable structure of the majority of known integrable models in physics.,0
Integrability of various arrangements of quantum gates might not be surprising in light of Baxter s work on solvable two-dimensional eight-vertex models of equilibrium statistical mechanics [].,0
"Our case of quantum circuits, in which any neighbouring pair of qubits is acted upon exactly once per period, may be regarded as a non-equilibrium analog of such lattice models.",0
"Here, we establish a clear correspondence between the selection of inhomogeneities in the transfer matrixandthegeometricconfigurationofthegates.",0
"Our findings explain how the SEC classification number prelates to the integrable structure, and why it uniquely specifies a particular class of circuits with the same spectrum of quasienergies.",0
In subsection we go beyond the same-gate circuits by showing how to construct integrable circuits in which subsequent layers of gates are different.,0

Bethe-ansatz equations are reported in subsection : they clarify why the SEC classification number pdetermines the spectrum.,0
"We present the thermodynamic Bethe-ansatz equations in subsection , where we also describe the simplest thermodynamic state of our Floquet-driven systems: an infinite-temperature grandcanonical Gibbs ensemble at a finite chemical potential .",0

Someoftheintegrablespace-and-time-periodic circuits considered herein break the space-reflection symmetry due to an asymmetric arrangement of the gates.,0
"We will show that the latter is not sufficient for the drift to appear: a drift necessarily requires quantum gates that act on different degrees of freedom (e.g., different spins).",0

"Now, a specific choice of the inhomogeneities yields a transfer matrix from which the timeevolution operator can be constructed.",0
Below we review how one can obtain a discrete-time brickwork-type evolution operator in the case of the Rmatrix of the isotropic Heisenberg model. .,0
"Integrable Trotterization of the Heisenberg model The Rmatrix is symmetric in the sense that Ri,j( ) = Rj,i( ), and for Rit satisfies Ri,j( ) =Ri,j( ) .",0
"However, we will start differently: a special role is played by the circuitswhich, ina certainlimit, reproducean integrablecontinuous-time dynamics.",0
"Firstly, this is convenient because, for small , and using the R matrix of the Heisenberg model as an example, we have Uj,j+= i Pj,j++O( 2).",0
"In the first order in , the gate therefore corresponds to an exponential of the local Hamiltonian density hj,j+=Pj,j+ (+ j j+)oftheintegrableisotropicHeisenbergmodel, inaccordance Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries with the definition of the time-evolution operator for Hamiltonian systems.",0
"Specifically, by applying the YBE diagram , we can transfer the sequence of red and blue diamonds connected with a curved black line from the bottom of the circuit to the top, without For simplicity we have fixed the number of lattice sites to L= , but the diagrammatic argument extends to any even positive integer length L. Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries changing their ordering the ingoing and outgoing sequences of thin red and thick blue vertical lines are the same.",0
"That sequence of diamonds is the transfer matrix, the closed black curve representing the partial trace over the auxiliary qubit.",0
"From the colours of the diamonds [see Eq. ] or, equivalently, from the widths of the ingoing (or outgoing) vertical lines, we can identify the sequence of inhomogeneities that enter the transfer matrix on Lsites.",0
"s L , sL =|s2, s3, , sL, s1 , where sj { , }, and it shifts the operators as, e.g., WUj,j+=Uj ,jW. To summarize, we have used diagrams to identify the transfer matrix T( )that commutes with the propagator U.",0
"The transfer matrix consists of Rmatrices, whose spectral parameters are shifted either by 1, or by 2(the so-called inhomogeneities).",0
"We indicate the shift of the spectral parameter in each Rmatrix by making the vertical line that represents a qubit either thin and red ( 1), or thick and blue ( 2).",0
Generalization to other geometries The above reasoning can be used to identify other integrable arrangements of quantum gates.,0
"If acted upon by the right leg of a quantum gate, the vertical line representing it changes from thick blue to thin red.",0
"Conversely, it changes from thin red to thick blue, if it is subject to the action of the left leg of a quantum gate: . . . . . . . . . . . .",0
The circuit then preserves the sequence of line colours and thicknesses: the latter corresponds to the sequence of inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix.,0
This certainly occurs in the same-gate circuits in which each neighbouring pair of qubits is acted upon by the gate exactly once in a period.,0
"Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries The one-period propagator of such a circuit is reproduced as U= [T( 1)] 1T( 2), where the inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix are identified from the conserved sequence of ingoing (or outgoing) thin red ( j= 1) and thick blue ( j= 2) lines.",0
"L= 10qubits, whose gate acts on every pair of neighbouring qubits exactly once per period, has the same spectrum as either one of these circuits, or as a brickwork circuit in Eq. .",0
"The coloured lines of different widths indicate what occurs to Rmatrices that constitute the transfer matrix (a sequence of diamonds at the bottom of each panel, connected by a closed loop), once they are exchanged with a gate according to YBE .",0
The transfer matrix is preserved if the output sequence of colours and widths (top of each panel) matches the input-one (bottom of each panel).,0
"Observe that, in each case, the SEC classification number pis the same as the number of inhomogeneities 1in the transfer matrix.",0
"As we will see later on, transfer matrices with the same set of inhomogeneities (i.e., irrespective of their ordering in the sequence ) share the same set of Bethe equations and thus have the same spectrum see subsection .",0
2forp < j L. Other circuits in the same SEC as can be obtained by applying a suitable sequence of permutations that redistribute the inhomogeneities inside the transfer matrix. .,0
Integrable circuits with differing layers We now go beyond the same-gate circuits by considering transfer matrices with periodic patterns of multiple inhomogeneities.,0
"Invoking the YBE diagram again, we observe that such a transfer matrix commutes with a circuit, in which different layers are formed from different gates.",0
"In particular, this means that not every circuit with the above geometry is integrable the parameters in the Rmatrices which correspond to gates should be properly related.",0
"using the transfer matrix with inhomogeneities , we first observe T( 1) =W Y j L 3U( 13) 3j ,3j 1U( 12) 3j ,3j, T( 2) =W Y j L 3U( 21) 3j ,3j 2U( 23) 3j ,3j , T( 3) =W Y j L 3U( 32) 3j ,3jU( 31) 3j,3j+.",0
"These transfer matrices can be combined to yield the three-site lattice shift T( 1)T( 2)T( 3) =W3, as well as the three circuits, whose bulk is depicted in Fig. .",0
"Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries As usual, the arrows denote the direction of the increasing index in the product.",0
"The above identification of transfer matrices generating different-gate integrable circuits can be extended to larger numbers of inhomogeneities, as well as to circuits that are not space-periodic, i.e., circuits in which the system size Lis not a multiple of q. Having provided a proof-of-concept example, we instead proceed by highlighting how to quickly discern an integrable same-gate circuit from a given set of inhomogeneities. .",0
"Lattice-cut construction of periodic same-gate circuits Given an arrangement of gates in a circuit, we have so far been able to determine the set of inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix.",0
"Here, we will demonstrate a procedure which allows that for the same-gate circuits that are periodic in both space and time.",0
"We now cut through the lattice with a line that intersects vertical and horizontal edges based Integrability and charge transport in asymmetric quantum-circuit geometries t 2 1 t x(a) (q, r) = ( ,) t 2 1 t x (b) (q, r) = ( ,) Figure .",0
Lattice cuts are the dashed lines which intersect vertical and horizontal lattice edges according to the ordering of 1and 2in the set of transfer-matrix inhomogeneities .,0
Eigenstates and thermodynamic states Our aim now shifts towards describing the eigenstates of the same-gate quantum unitary circuits that are periodic in space and time.,0
"As described in subsection , such circuits can be identified via the lattice-cut construction, starting from a periodic set of transfer-matrix inhomogeneities j { 1, 2}, where 2 1is the gate parameter.",0
"Consider a circuit on L qNqubits, with space periodicity of qsites and time periodicity of qsteps, for example, the circuits in Figs.",0
"The set of inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix generating such a circuit has a period q: the inhomogeneities satisfy j+q= j, and we can identify a repeated subsequence ( 1, . . .",0
"For the same-gate periodic circuits it generally holds that the q-step Floquet evolution operator Uis obtained from the transfer matrix as U= [T( 1)] 1T( 2), while the q-site space shift towards the west (left) is Wq= [T( 1)]n1[T( 2)]n2.",0
"Importantly, the way in which the time shift is expressed in terms of transfer matrices is the same for all same-gate circuits: it does not explicitly depend on n1andn2, as is the case for the space-shift operator . .",0

"The number of terms containing 1 and 2in the expression for the quasimomentum p1( ), respectively, n1andn2, reflects the pattern of inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix generating the circuit.",0
"On the other hand, the expression for the quasienergy is independent of n1andn2, consistently with our previous observation that U does not explicitly depend on these two parameters.",0
"The latter number is the SEC (spectral equivalence class) classification number introduced in subsection , i.e.,L1 p.+ Bethe equations imply that, in a system of size L, with fixed 1and 2, the rapidities that characterize the spectrum of the circuit with a period qdepend only on L1.",0
"Indeed, Bethe equations remain unaffected by an arbitrary redistribution of the inhomogeneities among the Rmatrices that form the transfer matrix .",0
"In particular, all integrable circuits originating in a transfer matrix that contains L1inhomogeneity parameters 1(the rest being 2), irrespective of whether the circuit is periodic or not, will have the same spectrum of quasienergies, and will thus belong to the same SEC. .",0

"Crucially, this holds irrespective of how we choose the numbers n1,2of the inhomogeneities 1,2in the spatial period of the transfer matrix .",0
"In particular, setting n1 =n2 we obtain a quantum circuit with a broken space-reflection symmetry: since n1+n2=qis the period of the circuit, differing n1andn2necessarily lead to an asymmetric arrangement of quantum gates.",0
The result therefore implies that a left-right asymmetry due to the geometry of the circuit is not sufficient for the drift to appear in the dynamical spin susceptibility.,0
"Since all spins in the lattice are the same, s= , the quasienergy obtained from the eigenvalue of Uis always a difference of contributions from the same type of quasiparticles see Eq. .",0
This is also precisely where one expects nonzero correlations between one-site local observables in dual-unitary circuits [].,0

"The feasibility of this approach is backed up by the experimental capability to fabricate and probe small artificial spin lattices, such as spin dimers26,27and hexamers13,, as well as other structures like S= / spin chains21,.",0
"Specifically, we consider two S= / molecules, the -triangulene (4T), a triangular shape nanographene molecules with benzene rings along its side, and the -aza triangulene (5AT) a triangulene with benzene rings along its side, where the central carbon atom was replaced by a nitrogen one32 .",0
"Our calculations of 2, 3for 4T19the 5AT (see Appendix A) use the same approach13that successfully accounts for non-linear exchange for S= , namely, exact diagonalization of the Hubbard models in a restricted space of multielectronic configurations, and the mapping of the low energy levels to a spin Hamiltonian.",0
"probe the energy excitations of a single surface spin38 through spin-flip assisted tunneling39 , where transport electrons exchange spin and energy with the atomic spin (Fig.",0
"As electrons tunnel from tip to surface (or vice-versa), they can release their excess energy eVto excite the on-surface spins.",0
"The process has to conserve energy, so that |eV|=EM EM , where EM, EM are the energies of eigenstates of the on-surface spin Hamiltonian, the BLBQBC model in our case.",0
"In this approach, the dI/dV depends both on the occupations PMof the eigenstates of the spin Hamiltonian, |M , and on the spin matrix elements M|Sa(i)|M where Sa(i) is the spin operator or the spin site ibeing excited with the STM tip and a=x, y, z .",0
"In that regime, occupations are bias dependent and, more important, excitations from excited states can also be seen in the dI/dV , as shown experimentally for Mn dimers on Cu 2N43.",0
"The non-equilibrium kinetics of the the occupations of the collective spin states of the molecules is governed by the Pauli master equation42: dPM dt=X MPM WM ,M PMX M WM,M where WM ,Mare the transition rates from M toM.",0
In this section we discuss how to determine the three exchange couplings of the BLBQBC interaction in a nonequilibrium IETS experiment on a dimer.,0
"B. Finding exchange values using IETS As we have seen before, the BLBQBC dimer has multiplets ( S= ,,,), and thus three energy gaps.",0
"However, since the spin model we are studying has three parameters, we would need three inelastic steps to be able to determine the three energy scales of the BLBQBC dimer experimentally.",0
"The observation of these three steps, at voltages VI,VII,VIII(see red lines in figure ) would permit one to fully determine a system of three equations and three unknowns ( J1, J2, J3): eVI=E E = J1 2J2+ 16J3 eVII=E E = J1 7J2+ 8J3 eVIII=E E = J1+ 2J2+ 16J3 where we have used F = ,F = ,F = 2andF = .",0
"A. Low energy states at the AKLT point The AKLT wave function is built by describing each physical S= / with three virtual S= /, each forming a singlet with a virtual spin from a first neighbor.",0
"For the case with periodic boundary conditions, with all edges passivated, the ground state is unique and has S= , and the lowest excited state has S= , with an excitation energy EPBC J/.",0
"This has three main effects in the dI/dV spectrum: i) steps associated to transitions between the previously degenerate -state manifold appear; ii) the number of transitions to higher energy states is reducing significantly, since the ground state is now unique (with a given SandSzquantum numbers), and spin selection rules only allow transitions with S= ,; iii) the value of the conductance at zero bias increases.",0
"C. Effective spin model for fractional edge spins close to the AKLT point We now discuss the spectrum of the OBC hexamer described with the BLBQBC model close to the AKLT point, so that the degeneracy of the GS is lifted, but there is still a clear gap between the low energy states and the rest.",0
"5a, we present the energy spectrum of the BLBQBC model with parameters 2= and 3= , chosen to be close to the AKLT point and in the red trajectory rshown in Fig. 5c.",0
"Both models predict a ground state with S= and k= , a first excited state with S= and k= and a second excited state with S= and k= ; as for the multiplets with higher energy one finds a perfect correspondence with the S= / model.",0
"In the proximity of the AKLT point where we are studying the system, the 65th state still has S= and k= , and the big gap with the bulk of low-energy states is also mantained.",0
V. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a theoretical framework to guide experimental efforts in realizing the AKLT model using nanographene-based structures.,0
"Extending our analysis to an hexamer in the S= / AKLT model, we predict a strong dependence of the IETS spectrum on an external magnetic field, leading to ground-state degeneracy lifting and therefore the appereance of inelastic transition within the low-energy manifold, and suppression of high-energy excitations due to preferential occupation of states with large negative Sz.",0
"Future studies should extend these methods to larger nanographene structures, leveraging advanced numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo45and Neural-Network Quantum States46to further explore AKLT physics in realistic experimental settings, with implications for quantum magnetism and measurement-based quantum computing8.",0
We also define a normalization factor =P i T(i) S(i) is a parameter that quantifies the tip-surface transmission through the magnetic atoms.,0
"(A1), the calculation of dI/dV gives thermally broadened steps at the bias voltages that match on-surface excitations that conserve energy and spin.",0
"For a given sign of bias, only the tip-surface events contribute to the excitation of the spin towards higher energy states.",0
"The tip-tip and surface-surface scattering events contribute to the relaxation of the system, promoting the occupation of low energy states.",0
"where Tgives the magnitude of the exchange coupling of the atomic spin to the transport electrons, is the voltage difference of the electrodes and is the density of states at the Fermi Energy for the electrode .",0
"The Aza[]-Triangulene (A5T) refers to a triangulene with five benzene rings along its side, where the central carbon atom was replaced by a nitrogen one32 .",0
"Without nitrogen functionalization, in the non-interacting limit, the 5T molecule has orbitals at zero energy49, each hosting one electron, leading to a spinS= when interactions are accounted for.",0
"However, when the central carbon atom is replaced by nitrogen, one of these zero energy levels goes down in energy, due to the electrostatic potential created by the extra proton in nitrogen, compared to carbon.",0
"This red-shifted zero mode becomes doubly occupied due to the additional electron brought in by the dopant; the other three levels at zero energy remain singly occupied, so that the ground state of A5T has S= /.",0
"Our calculations for the dimer predict a S= ground state, with a set of low energy excitations well described by the spin/2HBLBQBC Hamiltonian.",0
"The CI-CAS method can mesummarized as follows: first, one solves the single particle problem (i.e. without Hubbard repulsion); second, the Hubbard Hamiltonian is expressed in the basis of the eigenstates found in the previous step; finally, we truncate the Hilbert space to include only the single particle states closer to zero-energy, and diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian in the Hilbert space spanned by all possible electron configurations over the considered single particle states.",0
"We discuss the method to label the states of hexamers with a wave vector, taking advantage of the fact that hexamer Hamiltonians have C6symmetry.",0
"We represent the translation operator in the basis of such manifolds and diagonalize it, obtaining thereby simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and the translation operator, with well defined wave vector k.",0

"We classify the NXB as any feature read out by the detector, that is unrelated to sky X-rays focused by the telescope, such as GCRs.7We can broadly divide the particle interactions into primary interactions of the (mostly) GeV protons with the detector, and events from secondary particles.",0
"While the primary GCR interactions deposit a charge signature that is very characteristic, both in terms of amplitude and pattern distribution, the events from secondaries, however, can mimic the energy and pattern of sky X-rays and, so, constitute the major component of NXB in X-ray observations.",0
"Any mitigation of the NXB through simple background subtraction or modeling is problematic since the NXB is variable spatially, in energy and in time.",0
"This enables us to understand the time, spatial and energy dependence of the particle induced background component, which is critical to verify cosmic ray simulations with Geant4.",0
"While in a previous study, investigated a similar dataset in the limited energy band from ( ) keV , a lot more information can be extracted by, a) utilizing the full energy band, b) including more observations in various filter configurations, and c) comparing these data with data from other instruments, such as the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) anti-coincidence shield rates.",0
"Our goal is to reach a better understanding of the GCR induced background in X-ray CCD observations to both, lower the level of this particle background, and limit the systematic uncertainties connected with it.",0
"PN allows observations in SWM, that operates a small area of the detector (about % of the total area), but does not apply onboard minimum ionizing particle (MIP) thresholding, i.e., all events processed are retained in the final event file.",0
"Self anti-coincidence (SAC) is an important tool to mitigate the particle induced background, and therefore illustrate and optimize the methodology.",0
We want to emphasize that only a thorough understanding of all manifestations of the particle background allows us to develop algorithms that reduce the systematic uncertainties in X-ray observations.,0

"We further filter the valid and invalid events in energy or pulse height amplitude (PHA), where valid events are required to have an energy (PI column) between and eV , and the invalid events need to have a PHA of at least adu , equal to approximately eV (see Fig.",0
"However, each frame with invalid events must at least contain one event with energy of more than keV , indicating a MIP.",0
"This happens more often than expected for the rare case of perfectly aligned particle tracks, and these detections are likely due to artifacts from the readout.",0

In the future we plan to perform detailed Geant4 simulations with an accurate PN mass model to understand the length distribution.,0
Spectral properties of particle background components We analyze the energy distribution of valid events in Case B and C frames in the PN SWM dataset with filter closed position.,0
"We also see a hint of Pt L ( keV ) in the Case C frames, which does not show up in the Case B frames, despite better statistics.",0
"During readout however, the GCRs can easily produce fluorescent Cu and Zn photons that are detected, but end up in a frame with a particle track, as Case C frames.",0
"The readout is likely going to affect the detected photon energy, which systematically shifts these lines in Case C frames.",0
"[pix]5102040Distance [pix] Slope Fig Left: Fluorescent Cu X-rays in Case C frames show a correlation between the length of the associated particle track in the frame l, and the distance between X-rays and track.",0
"If the charge in the detector from the Cu/Zn photons is split over multiple pixels (pattern), some of it might be confused with the nearby particle track and is not correctly added to the X-ray-like event.",0
"In order to verify our picture of the Case C fluorescent Cu events, we look at these events in a bit more detail: From the Case C frames with a valid event energy consistent with Cu, we correlate the particle track length with the distance between the track and the X-ray event in each frame.",0
"We find a separation of about h 280 m 140 m 450 m, which is a reasonable result considering that the actual distance is 250 m, and the pixel thickness (depletion depth) is 280 m. Temporal variability of the particle background The time variability on various scales remains a significant source of systematic uncertainty in the NXB (e.g., ).",0
"A rapidly changing particle rate and/or spectrum will render any blank sky background subtraction very difficult, and likely insufficient for future missions such as Athena WFI, which require a precise knowledge of the background.2Instead a deeper understanding of the particle background variability and its dependencies is required to develop models and mitigation methods.",0
In the following we analyze the lightcurves of the particle interactions with the PN and the Chandra HRC anti-coincidence shield.,0
"The number of invalid events (i.e., the total number of pixels in particle tracks) is not a good measure for the particle background rate, as, depending on geometry, tracks appear longer and sometimes events from secondary particles are also detected.",0
"Also the number of islands/tracks is not a good measure of the primary particle rate, as a single primary can trigger a shower of secondary events which might be detected as invalid events in separate islands within the same frame (this happens in %of the Case A frames).",0
"Therefore, the best quantity to use is the number of frames with invalid events, as this is the least noisy tracer of the particle rate.",0
Case A frames trace the particle background level and any method that utilizes the particle tracks in Case A or C frames to estimate or mitigate the X-ray particle background can be applied to sky observations as well.,0
"The only other explanation is soft protons, that get partly focused by the XMM optics and cause X-ray like patterns and energy signatures.",0
"The verification of the HRC shield data s consistency with PN SWM Case A rates highlights that two instruments on different satellites in slightly different orbits trace the same particle rate, which allows the application of conclusions from the high statistics HRC shield data to PN SWM data as well.",0
"The reason is likely a time variable spectrum of the GCRs (e.g., ) that causes the distinct measurements in various instruments depending on the instruments energy sensitivity.",0
"[cps] Orbit [%] Fig Left: Power spectrum of the median HRC shield lightcurve, showing significant power in the particle background variability above hour.",0
"The HRC shield is most sensitive to particles with energies of tens of MeV , while the PN SWM Case A events are mostly induced by GeV protons.",0
A collection of simultaneous particle rate measurements in different orbits (other than XMM-Newton and Chandra) will help to quantify the orbital contribution to the residuals.,0
The wealth of information contained in the Chandra HRC shield dataset allows us to analyze a power spectrum of particle background variability.,0
"However, the elliptical orbit of Chandra passes through the Van Allen belts, which temporarily interrupts all science observations, including the operation of the HRC shield.45Therefore, the total orbital period of about h permits continuous observations for only about h. We derive a lightcurve of each Chandra orbit from the HRC shield rates, and quantify the orbital mean rate, its standard deviation, and the linear slope of the time dependence.",0
"The orbit-to-orbit scatter does not change with orbital properties, such as mean rate, slope or rate standard deviation.",0
"The longer this critical timescale is, the less time variable is the particle background, and it can be assumed to be almost constant on timescales shorter than the critical timescale.",0
The GCR particle background events (shown in orange) have a similar singles fraction to observations with strong soft proton contamination.,0
"Since all of the slew observations are exposed to the diffuse X-ray foreground emission from the Galaxy, the Local Hot Bubble, and the Cosmic X-ray Background, but also to the particle background, it seems plausible that observations with few soft protons have singles fractions between the clusters and the closed filter observations.",0
"We focus exclusively on single events in the following, since they have the best statistics, and other patterns might have different spectra.",0
"Utilizing self anti-coincidence to reduce the particle background Case C frames contain both, a particle track and an X-ray-like event.",0
"Due to the short frame time of the SWM ( ms ) there is a high chance that these events (valid and invalid in Case C) are correlated, meaning the particle also created the X-ray event (see also ).",0
"We know that all frames with invalid events, I, are Case A and C frames, I=A+C, while the valid event frames are Case B and C frames, X=B+C. If we assume for now, that the particle and X-ray events in Case C frames are random and not correlated, we can derive the expected number of C frames, C=I X T=(A+C) (B+C) T, where Tis the total number of frames.",0
The result can be compared to the actual number of Case C frames to provide insight into the absolute/integrated probability of correlated events in Case C frames.,0
We can thus utilize the distance between particle tracks and X-ray events to derive a probability that the X-ray event was particle induced.,0
Random distribution of distances used an idealized random distribution for points on a disk of radius Rto derive the probability function.,0
"Panel d) shows the probability of an X-ray event at a given separation to the particle track, being induced by a particle (blue: closed filter observations, orange: medium filter with low SP).",0
"In order to compare the observed distribution of distances between X-ray and particle events in Case C frames, we use Eq.",0
"Finally, when there is intense soft proton contamination the agreement between the two curves is good, meaning almost none of the valid events in Case C frames are due to particle background events.",0
"These results are also reflected in panel (d) of Fig. , which shows the probability that an X-ray event at a given distance from the particle track is correlated with this track.",0
"Uncertainties in finding the center for the particle track, and noise induced X-ray-like events cause the majority of the other % of events.",0
"Note that we do not show the curve for the high soft proton observations, since it is essentially consistent with all events being unrelated to particle events.",0
We also note that the statistics for very short distances ( pixel ) are very poor and it becomes hard to clearly distinguish X-ray events from particle tracks.,0

"After applying the optimized SAC by filtering out X-ray like events based on the distance to the particle track, we find that especially the line-free energies from to keV (without the Al line) has been greatly reduced (see orange curve in Fig. ).",0
"This demonstrates that our optimization method for SAC is viable, and can improve the signal of faint diffuse sources, in this case the sky X-ray background.",0
"While this experiment shows that the SNR can only be improved marginally by SAC for SWM observations, the obvious next step would be a larger detector area.",0
"Summary Many characteristics of the particle induced background in X-ray observations, such as its variability, are either unknown, or have large uncertainties, which limits our ability to make optimal use of the X-ray data.",0
"The combination of a short frame time of ms and disabled onboard MIP rejection allowed the detected events to be classified into valid (X-ray like) and invalid (particle-like) events, based on their energy and pattern signatures.",0
"This enabled us to study the statistical properties and correlations of the NXB and particle events: From slew observations in SWM and in closed filter mode we found a distribution of particle tracks that is consistent with expectations: The spatial distribution of the tracks reflects the readout pattern, while the orientation is more uniform.",0

"Interestingly, in frames that also contain invalid events the line flux is much higher, and the line energy of Cu and Zn is shifted to slightly lower energies, while all other fluorescent lines remain unchanged.",0

The question of whether interactions can break dynamical localization in quantum kicked rotor systems has been the subject of a long-standing debate.,0
"Here, we introduce an extended mapping from the kicked LiebLiniger model to an e ffective lattice model with long-range couplings and reveal two universal features: on-site pseudorandomness and rapidly decaying couplings in the center-of-mass momentum.",0
"For finite contact interactions, the long-range coupling between relative momenta obeys an algebraic decay behavior with a crossover of its decay exponent as the interaction increases.",0
"Our results o ffer an explanation for the occurrence of many-body dynamical localization, particularly in strongly correlated quantum gases, and are anticipated to generalize to systems of many particles.",0
"For example, the quantum kicked rotor (QKR), as a driven single-particle system, exhibits dynamical localization (DL) [ ]: non-resonant periodic driving paradoxically leads to suppressed energy absorption.",0
"Such an unexpected halt in energy growth in the quantum realm starkly contrasts our everyday experience, which tells us that driven systems generally thermalize to infinite temperature.",0
"This challenge has spurred the development and investigation of various manybody QKR models, where particle-particle correlations are introduced through mechanisms such as periodic kicks [ ] or static contact interactions [ ].",0
Understanding the mechanism of localization sheds light on the role of many-body interactions in driven quantum systems.,0
The QKR model with contact interactions has received particular attention since it can be realized in cold-atom platforms.,0
"Predictions based on the mean-field approximation suggest that the system delocalizes at long times with a subdiffusive behavior of the energy [ ], consistent with recent experimental observations [, ].",0
"To date, most studies on MBDL have focused on obtaining the time evolution of the energy and the momentum distribution, starting from low-energy initial states [, , ].",0
"Using the LL eigenstates as a basis, we establish an extended mapping from this quantum system to an e ffective lattice model beyond the well-known mapping from DL to AL.",0
"In the lattice model, we find that the o ff-diagonal matrix elements between LL eigenstates feature a combination of rapidly decaying lower bounds and algebraic tails, with the latter being the result of the interactions.",0
This conclusion is further confirmed by an analysis in Fock basis and by inspecting the generalized fractal dimensions (GFD) and the energy-level-spacing statistics.,0
"We consider the 1D kicked LL model, meant to describe Nshort-range interacting bosons of mass Maconstrained to a ring of circumference L=2 , subject to a pulsed sinusoidal potential [, , ], as illustrated in Fig.",0
"In momentum space, the kinetic energy component is represented by a quadratic potential defined over a momentum lattice.",0

"(d-f) show the same data as in (a-c) but for N= andM=. Here, we set = and the multiple layers of tails are due to di fferent center-of-mass momenta.",0
"The kicks nontrivially couple to the hopping in the center of mass momentum B Q Q , which decays exponentially with |Q Q |and indicates DL in the center-of-mass momentum space.",0
"In Fig. , starting from the ground state of the LL model, we calculate the o ff-diagonal term|W0I|for two and three particles at di fferent interactions.",0
"Despite more quantum numbers being involved in the lattice model, we find that |W0I|still has a lower bound by free particles, as expected in Eq. .",0
(a) The hopping amplitude as a function of the standard deviation pfor the particle number N= and di fferent interactions gin log-log scale.,0
This behavior indicates that the characteristic decay exponent of the algebraic tails of |W0I|is dominated by interaction.,0
"In the sense of large decay exponents, MBDL is expected across all values of gand the crossover of the algebraic tail indicates a distinct characterization of the high and low interaction regime.",0
"To connect to the experimentally accessible momentum distribution, we turn to study the Floquet operator in the Fock basisNN i=|mi .",0
"As we expected, the hopping amplitude of the center-of-mass momentum growth U00 pc0 follows a fast decay captured by the noninteracting result (insets), indicating DL.",0
"The algebraic tail in U p0 also suggests that kicking a nonequilibrium state with various interactions can produce DL with di fferent tails at steady state [, ].",0
The averaged energy-level-spacing ratio r as a function of gandKforM=. The black dashed line denotes where the LL parameter is =.,0
"Such a behavior aligns with the crossover of the tail of the hopping matrix both in LL and Fock basis, and is also consistent with the recently predicted non-monotonic change in localized interaction energy [].",0
"However, finite interactions introduce an algebraic tail to the localization properties, observed both in the LL eigenbasis and in the Fock basis.",0
"The exponent and amplitude of this algebraic tail exhibit a nontrivial dependence on the interaction strength, reflecting the characteristic features of the MBDL phase.",0
Our study provides an explanation for the longstanding question of MBDL s existence at finite interaction strengths and is anticipated to be valid for systems with many particles.,0
"At intermediate interaction strengths, the Floquet eigenstates become extended and the level statistics deviate from the integrable regime.",0
"Moreover, the ubiquitous algebraic tail of the momentum distribution, particularly at weak interactions, exhibits a phenomenological resemblance to that observed in quantum turbulence [, ].",0

Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions.,0
Introduction Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used throughout the sciences to describe the evolution of dynamical systems over time.,0
"Uncertainty propagation also plays a role in certain machine learning problems where the ODE vector field is learned from data, e.g. with a Gaussian process (Ridderbusch et al., ).",0
We experimentally validate our method on multiple dynamical systems and show how the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match the true propagated uncertainty.,0

"IVP information operators To relate the Gauss Markov prior to the solution of the IVP, we need to enforce both the initial value and the ODE itself.",0

"Overall, this shows the need for a modification or extension of the existing ODE filtering algorithm to perform uncertainty propagation.",0
"Second, we compute the expectation and variance of the Gaussian mixture distribution and obtain the desired moments of the ODE solution posterior.",0
Computing the expectation and covariance of the ODE solution posterior Now that we approximated the ODE solution posterior with a Gaussian mixture distribution as in Eq.,0
"i , where i(t), i(t) are the mean and covariance of the ith mixture Gaussian component at time t, respectively, and with (t) =E[y(t)]p(y(t))as in Eq. .",0
This yields the desired moments of the ODE solution with respect to the parameter distribution p( ) and the numerical uncertainty of the ODE solver itself and concludes the algorithm.,0
Experiments This section evaluates the proposed probabilistic uncertainty propagation method on a range of dynamical systems.,0
We first validate the proposed uncertainty propagation method on multiple dynamical systems and qualitatively compare the resulting mean and variance estimates to an accurate reference solution (Section ).,0

The mean and variance estimates by our probabilistic uncertainty propagation method largely align with the reference solution.,0
The non-PN part corresponds exactly to the variance that one would compute without any numerical ODE solver uncertainty (see also Remark ).,0

The flattened data is then bootstrapped and a series of growing sinusoid regression are applied via an Levenberg Marquardt optimization scheme.,0
Experiments We investigate each step of our plume data-reduction method in order to identify the best parameter choices.,0
"To provide data for experiments, we filmed a smoke machine, where plumes were formed by vaporizing a water based triethylene glycol liquid, under three different intensities of crosswind, resulting in fifteen different videos.",0
"Additionally, while quadratic and square-root curves can be described as instances of a parametric quadratic curve, in implementation, the regression does not require the fitted curve to enforce r2=x2+y2(nor can it, while retaining quadratic terms).",0
"The advantage was most significant in low-wind datasets, where the plume arcs throughout the frame, and mostly disappeared in high-crosswind datasets, where the force from high-crosswind would rapidly dominate the initial point-source ejection force of the plume.",0
"If, on the contrary, the plume s path at a particular radius is better described by its center of mass, or by the midpoint of the identified contours, the data fed into this experiment would naturally be smoother.",0

"Fitting is done by solving the unconstrained optimization problem via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, to which if no optimal parameters are found within a given number of iterations, the trail is rejected and disregarded.",0
"Such bimodal behavior, exhibited in figure , could be an artifact of the nonconvex optimization problem, but could just as well indicate a nonlinear phase shift.",0

These findings reinforced previous studies by demonstrating that cognitive biases could be systematically leveraged in chatbot design to encourage behavioural shifts in various domains.,0
"While their work highlights the challenges of detecting cognitive biases in voice-based searches and proposes a multimodal experimental framework, it remains largely theoretical.",0
Establishing this baseline is crucial to validating the chatbot s effectiveness in eliciting similar behavioural patterns observed in traditional experiments.,0

"When dealing with flexible structures, spatial discretization is required to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).",0
"A specific instance of the Newmark method, the implicit midpoint method, also preserves energy when applied to linear systems; however, this property does not extend to the nonlinear case.",0
"To achieve exact energy preservation in geometrically nonlinear problems, the stress tensor should not be evaluated at the midpoint but instead computed as an average between the current and next time instants, as shown in [].",0
"The first of these methods, known as invariant energy quadratisation (IEQ) approaches, was initially applied to phase-field models [].",0
"First, geometrically nonlinear models are formulated in a non-canonical Hamiltonian form (also known as the Poisson formulation) by considering the dynamics of the stress tensor.",0
"The finite element discretization employs a conforming approximation of the displacement and velocity fields, along with a discontinuous approximation of the stress tensor.",0

The linearly implicit scheme is compared against the St ormer-Verlet method and the exact energy conserving scheme presented in [].,0

One can notice that the leapfrog method only approximately conserves the energy where the discrete gradient and linear implicit method preserve it up to machine precision.,0
"In this example, however, there is no mass matrix coming from a finite element discretization, so it is natural that a fully explicit method is by one order of magnitude faster.",0
"The discrete gradient method respects energy conservation but not as accurately, probably because of tolerances settings in the Newton method to compute the nonlinear solution.",0
Since now mass matrices are included in the formulation the different methods take comparable time for the same time step.,0

We note that the limited spectral range achievable with the AC Stark effect makes it difficult to obtain accurate fits when tunneling energy is far below the qubit frequency.,0

"Specifically, we consider modifications to the primordial power spectrum (ns= , s = ), geometry ( k = ), dark energy ( w = ), the effective number of relativistic species ( Neff = ), and the primordial helium fraction ( Yp), as well as an Early Dark Energy (EDE) component.",0
"While CMB experiments are often considered the gold standard of precision cosmology, our results reinforce that these measurements are not immune to systematic uncertainties, which may be underestimated in current analyses.",0
I. INTRODUCTION The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides one of the strongest observational pillars of modern cosmology.,0
"These data sets allow the construction of a standard model of cosmology: CDM, in which a spatially flat Universe is dominated at late times by a cosmological constant, , and cold dark matter (CDM).",0
"However, it is important to underline that CDM remains a phenomenological framework containing three major unknown ingredients inflation, dark matter, and dark energy whose theoretical motivations still lack direct experimental confirmation.",0
"While the Planck satellite has provided the tightest constraints to date, ACT can offer valuable confirmation of Planck cosmology.",0
"Although the large experimental uncertainties in the late-time sector suggest thatthe discrepancy between the two probes could stem from an inconsistency in the early Universe, we include latetime solutions for two main reasons: first, to explore the possibility that this anomaly is somehow linked to the Hubble tension and determine whether any of the beyondCDM phenomenology studied can increase the present-day expansion rate of the Universe while also leading to an agreement between the two CMB probes; and second, because for each model, we also impose ns= ,therebyintroducingamodificationatearlytimes. .",0
"Primordial Power Spectrum A general prediction of inflationary theory is that the power spectrum of density perturbations can be well described by a power law kns, where nsis the scalar spectral index.",0
"Although it is possible to recover the HZ spectrum in specific inflationary models (e.g., [ ]), generally, a value of ns = 1is considered strong evidence in favor of inflationary theory.",0
"For example, tensor modes in the CMB are a unique prediction of inflationary theory, and their amplitude is expected to be proportionaltothesquareofthedeviationfromscaleinvariance, |ns |.",0
"The latest CMB observations provided by Planckexclude an HZ spectrum at more than 8 [, , ], corroborating inflationary theory.",0
"[, , , , ], but still favor a scale-independent spectral index at 2 , as also suggested by forecasts of future experiments [, ]. .",0
"Late Dark Energy Since our Universe is accelerating [ ], the dominant component of our Universe today must be characterized by a negative pressure, so that it can counterbalance the natural decelerated expansion.",0
"This component is called Dark Energy ( %of the total content), and in the standard model of cosmology, it is parametrized by a positive cosmological constant, .",0
"With wnow a free parameter, aside from recovering CDM when w= , we can explore two different regimes: the phantom regime [ ], characterized by w < 1and a possible violation of the null energy condition (although it is possible for the equation of state to be effectively phantom without violating the null energy condition), and the quintessence regime[ ].",0
"Universe Geometry Spatial curvature is usually parameterized by the curvature energy density parameter k, which affects the Hubble expansion rate with a redshift dependence ( +z).",0
"In modern cosmology, it has become common practice among phenomenologists and observers to consider the curvature parameter as optional, setting k= and reducing to the standard six-parameter CDM concordancecosmology.",0
"This joint analysis reduces (and often eliminates) the preference for a negative curvature parameter, at the cost of combining experiments that are in tension at more than 3 (see e.g., [, , ]).",0
"Effective Number of Relativistic Degrees of Freedom With the expansion of the Universe, the temperature drops below the electron mass ( T MeV), initiating pair annihilation between electrons and positrons.",0
"Such an increase in energy does not affect neutrinos, as they decouple at T MeV[ ] and therefore no longer share the same temperature, with T =T .",0
"We can now introduce the parameter Neff, called the effective number of relativistic species [ ], which accounts for the non-instantaneous decoupling of neutrinos (in which case we would have Neff= ) and the consequent injection of some energy.",0
"Any additional relativisticparticleproducedbeforerecombinationcanbetreated as an additional contribution to this number (but also 2We opt for the first one simply because we wanted to impose the most stringent limit on the helium mass fraction to observe a shift in b.other contributions are possible, for example from inflationary gravitational waves [].",0
"Notably, since the radiation energy density ris proportional to the effective number of neutrinos, different values of Neffmodify the sound horizon at recombination.",0
"Deviating from the traditional cosmological constant framework, EDEmodelsaccountforanon-negligiblecontribution from dark energy in the early Universe.",0
The phenomenological analyses of these inhomogeneousdarkenergymodelsusuallyrequire additional dark energy clustering parameters: the dark energy effective sound speed and the dark energy anisotropic stress.,0
Theeffectivesoundspeeddeterminestheclusteringproperties of dark energy and consequently affects the growth of matter density fluctuations.,0
"As soon as the Hubble parameter falls below the mass of the field at some particular redshift z , the scalar field rolls down its potential and begins to oscillate about the minimum.",0
"To avoid spoiling latetime cosmology, the vacuum energy must redshift away more quickly than matter (i.e., faster than a ), and the field should remain a subdominant component.",0
"A typical set of parameters used in this model includes the fractional contribution to the total energy density of the Universe, fEDE(z) EDE(z)/ tot(z), evaluated at the critical redshift zcwhere it reaches its maximum value, and i, which typically describes the initial field displacement.",0

"We design acomputationally e cient agnostic boos ting algorithm that matches the sample complexity of ERM, given polynomially many additional unlabel ed samples.",0
"In fact, we show that the total number of samples needed, unlabeled and labeled inclusive, is never more than that for the best known agnostic boosting algorithm so this result is never worse while only a vanishing fraction of these need to be labeled for the algorithm to succeed.",0
"Introduction The methodology of boosting, starting with the work of Schapire [ ], has deep roots both in the practice and theory of machine learning.",0
Can one use such weak learners to construct an accurate learning algorithm?1Boosting provides an a rmative answer to this question.,0
"The celebrated Adaboost algorithm [Freund and Schapire, ], for ins tance, achieves the same (near-optimal) sample complexity as ERM.",0
"Let us now move to the agnostic case, where we make no assumptions about the conditional distribu tion of labels given features; in many ways, this has become the default s tance in machine learning.",0
"In fact, Kearns and Valiant [] were interested in representation-independent hardness of learning, i.e., hardness that persists indepen dently of algorithmic parametrization.",0
"However, th e sample complexity of their boosting algorithm scales as (log |H|)/ 4, where His the (let us say for now, nite2) hypothesis class.",0
"Under this stipulation, our m ain result is a computationally e cient agnostic boosting algorithm with (labeled) sample complexity scaling as (log|H|)/ 2, and therefore for the rst time matching that of ERM.",0
"Our work also di ers qualitatively, in thatitdoesnotrequireadditionalassumptions,comparedtosemisupervisedlearningmethods[Chapelle et al., ], which often require a tight clustering of data or smoothness of labels.",0
"Our main innovation is to design a new bivariate potential (Equation ) whose derivative is decomposable as one term exclusively dependent on the label, and the other exclus ive involving the features.",0
"Also, unlike previous work, our algorithm reuses the entire set of labeled examples across all round s of boosting without paying for uniform convergence on the boostedclass.",0
"With this 2Purely for ease of presentation, in the introduction, we sti ck to nite classes and drop dependencies in the weak learnin g edge and the failure probability.",0
"See Theorem result, our total number of samples (labeled and unlabeled) matche s the number of labeled samples needed by the previous best result, yet for us, only a vanishing fraction of these needs to be labeled.",0
"We apply ourresultsto boostingfor reinforcementlearning, where wereduce the required number of reward-annotated episodes, and learning halfspaces.",0
"The objective of the learner is to produce a hypothesis h:X { }such that with probability at least , corrD(h) maxh HcorrD(h) , where , are pre-speci ed error tolerances.",0
"A crucial remark here is that this nal hypothesis may not belong to the hypotheses class H. The learners who are given such exibility are called improper , and all known boosting algorithms fall into this class.",0
"In this way, the magnitudes of contribution to the nal error for the boosting algorithm and the weak learner are made distinct.",0
"The algorithm simulates the process where t he true label is kept with probability (Ht(x),y)/ and chosen randomly otherwise.",0

We believe the fact that our framework can extend the literature to the generalized smoot h setting in this systematic way (albeit with lengthy proofs to check this high-probability decrease for poin ts in theF(www0)-sublevel set) is a core strength of our work.,0

"The simple but powerful insight in our work is that many optimization alg orithms, such as GD and SGD, decrease the function value of its iterates with high probability when the step size is appropriately chosen as a function of the smoothness (Hessian operator norm) at the currentiterate.",0

However the above framework Theorem lets us bypass such considerations; it formalizes the doubledipping argument for the analysis of GD from Subsection .,0

"As discussed earlier, we can show various algorithms (GD, SGD, adap tive GD, perturbed GD, and restarted SGD) satisfy De nition ,when initialized at points uuu0in theF(www0)-sublevel setLF,F(www0).",0
"In particular, uuu0being in the F(www0)-sublevel set crucially lets us shows that the algorithm is su ciently lo cal , which in turn gives us su cient quantitative controlover the relevant smo othness parameters, following the discussion fromSubsection .",0
"Then directly using our framework Theorem lets us conclude, without resorting to more ad-hoc algorithm-by-algorithm analyses.",0
"As such our framew ork reduces away the global analysis of the algorithm, to simply local analysis in the F(www0)-sublevel set.",0
We also highlight the implications of our work on understanding the fundamental behavior of rst-order optimization algorithms .,0

"Such a drastic RM variation suggests a dense magnetized clump moving across the line of sight, possibly due to coronal mass ejection associated with a stellar flare.",0
One sentence summary: An abrupt substantial variance in the Faraday rotation measure indicates an eruptive magneto-ionic environment surrounding a fast radio burst.,0
"The RM amplitude of FRBs spans from one to over one hundred thousand rad m , and the variances are usually in a similar order of magnitude.",0
"FAST and Parkes observations FRB was discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) on May and reported via the Virtual Observatory Event (VOEvent) service, with a dispersion measure (DM) of pc cm 3and a Milky Way contribution of DM MW= pc cm (, ).",0
"We calculated the chance coincidence probability Pccof the galaxies, and the galaxy PSO J019.+ is most likely to be the host, with a Pcc= .",0
"We performed a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with the DESI g, r, i band, and WISE w1 and w2 band photometric results to estimate the stellar mass of the host galaxy.",0
"Such an abrupt variance is unprecedented and cannot be attributed to the plasma density fluctuations, nor evolution due to binary orbital motion.",0
"Such ejecta provide a very small RM contribution, as the Faraday rotation effects caused by the two particle species tend to cancel each other out, resulting in relativistic pairs having a nearly zero RM contribution ( ).",0
"Since the probability of a CME moving across the line of sight is extremely low for an isolated FRB source, this model requires a companion star to eject the CME.",0
"Even though stellar flares may be common for certain low-mass stars with strong convection near the surface (e.g., flares per day per source) ( , ), the detection rate of such RM flares is likely low because only line-of-sight CMEs can cause a significant observational signature.",0
"Because the physical parameters (e.g., explosion energy, CME mass, etc.) of the stellar flares have wide distributions ( ), the maximum RM and the duration of similar events should have a lognormal distribution.",0
"The significance can be quantified with SNR RM= (RM peak RM)/ RM= , where RM is the standard deviation of RM in the background low RM state.",0
"Since there is no RM flare reported in other FRBs, we estimate their mean RMs and RM standard deviations with all the RM values and denote them as RM alland RM,all.",0
"The data were bias-subtracted, flat-fielded, cleaned of cosmic rays, wavelength calibrated using comparison-lamp spectra, and combined with PyPeit ( , ) under standard techniques.",0
Stellar Mass: We make a broadband Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting to explore the stellar masses of the host galaxy.,0
"During the SED fitting, the stellar population model from (BC03 ( )) with 5https://astromatic.net/software/sextractor/ 6https://cigale.lam.fr/ the Salpeter model as the initial mass function is used.",0
The RM variation from a young SNR should be monotonic if the magnetic geometry along the line of sight does not experience significant change.,0
"Therefore, in the following discussion, we consider that the observed RM variation in the RM flare state is attributed to a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with a stellar flare from the companion star in a binary system.",0
"We assume that the blob has a mass of M, an expanding speed of cs, a bulk-motion velocity of v, an initial size of l0, and an initial magnetic field of B0.",0
"We assume that the mass, initial magnetic field, and length scale of the stellar flare are M 1017g,B0 G andl0 2R , respectively.",0
"In order to keep the radio wave transparent, we also estimate the electron number density ne 107cm 1010cm when the blob crosses the LOS.",0
"For the initial time t0of MJDs = , , (-, -, days before the first time we observe the abrupt RM variance), the time when the blob center reaches the LOS is tc= + ,+ ,+ 8days, and the best fitting v2sin2 /c2 s= + ,+ ,+ , Fig.",0
"The index is consistent with those of FRB and FRB , indicating a supersonic turbulence, in star-forming region or shocked stellar wind in massive stars.",0
