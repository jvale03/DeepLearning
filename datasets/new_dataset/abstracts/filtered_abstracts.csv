"Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi'c's and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.","118"
"Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on SL_2mathbbZ for p2,3,5,7. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on Gamma_04N for N1,2,4. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of L-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.","110"

"We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 - ,1 and -,1 - 0, at a magnetic field B_0  30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes.","100"
"In XQM, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in XQM caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from XQM, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure.","102"
"We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.","103"
"We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation DDA, which is a general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects, the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.","104"
"We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges MLDC for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.","118"
"In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models HMMs in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length n with m-state HMM can be as low as Thetamlog n, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires Omn space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences such as complete human genome chromosomes and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences.","117"
"Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-T_c cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments ARPES, including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded.","120"
"We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea, as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.","119"
"From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal TM atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.","114"

"We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb 110. Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.","109"
"Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral D mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase difference in D0 to Kpi decay from the measurements of the mixing parameters, yprime, y_CP and x at the B factories. The sensitivity of the measurement of the mixing parameter y is estimated in BES-III experiment at psi3770 peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements of the mixing rate R_M. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the DbarD threshold with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.","112"
"Starting from the N1 SUN_c x SUN_c' gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and obtain the N1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold 6-plane, we generalize to the case for N1 SUN_c x SON_c' gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N1 SUN_c x SpN_c' gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.","111"
"We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts QPCs. At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.","115"
"We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO H1413117, z2.56. The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity 5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing. The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity Lbol  7E13 Lsun is coincident with an intense star formation rate 1000 Msunyr and short gas exhaustion time 3E7yr star forming event.","115"
"The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles quarks and leptons and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles sub-quarks and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.","120"
"Using the AdSCFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_BH, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_BH. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point. The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.","119"
"Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding finite time difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.","101"
"In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the omega meson we demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian; more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be part of any reliable theory.","114"
"An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.","106"
"We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1textitT-TiSe_2 in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in 1textitT-TiSe_2.","103"
"Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth Frobenius-Schur indicator, m1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m, the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For the classical Lie algebras sln, so2n, so2n1 and sp2n, this is the case for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n1, respectively.","105"
"We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.","100"
"We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos MaVaNs model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable.","107"
"We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs.","107"
"The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be essentially composed of the nonresonant alpha_pE_03.2, alpha_nE_04.1,the t-channel alphat_p,n-betat_p,n7.6 and the resonant beta_p,nP_3312328.3 contributions in units of 10-4fm3. The remaining deviations from the experimental data Deltaalpha_p1.2pm 0.6, Deltabeta_p1.2mp 0.6, Deltaalpha_n0.8pm 1.7 and Deltabeta_n2.0mp 1.8 are contributed by a larger number of resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon couplings to the sigma-meson having the predicted mass m_sigma666 MeV and two-photon width Gamma_gammagamma2.6 keV.","108"
"We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems.","105"
"We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of scalar curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside a scaled translate of the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K""ahler-Einstein product.","114"
"Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively.","103"
"We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a 3p_T4 GeVc trigger particle with two softer 1p_T2 GeVc particles. Results are shown for pp, dAu and high statistics AuAu collisions at sqrts_NN200 GeV. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central AuAu collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition, the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the p_T of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple QCD-vCerenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics v_2 and v_4 are investigated in detail.","117"
"A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation.","116"
"In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed Tate motives.","108"
"We review recent progress in applying the AdSCFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdSCFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosityentropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.","103"
"I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation DCA. The effects of spatial fluctuations non-local corrections are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.","117"
"The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in Non Perturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain n-point correlation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploiting a general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all vertices although approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed using the self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in this example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent eta by as much as 60. However, if one goes to high order truncations the procedure seems to converge rapidly.","103"
"We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.","119"
"In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs.","116"
"Gamma-Ray Bursts GRBs have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and models predict emission at  100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field 2 sr high duty cycle  90  ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts GRB detected since the beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present upper limits from these bursts.","107"
"We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.","118"
"We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.","113"
"Moore introduced a class of real-valued ""recursive"" functions by analogy with Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his ""primitive recursive"" functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog computation, fails.","104"
"We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule MT bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.","117"
"The Hamiltonian cycle problem HCP in digraphs D with degree bound two is solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an incidence matrix C_nm of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces PNP base on the results.","101"
"Motivated by the observation of a gapless spin liquid state in kappa-BEDT-TTF_2Cu_2CN_3, we analyze the anisotropic triangular lattice S12 Heisenberg model with the resonating valence bond mean-field approximation. Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy of the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional 1D chains coupled with frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra changing anisotropy parameter J'J from the decoupled 1D chains to the isotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide range from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration is considered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid state.","111"
"Based on the finite U slave boson method, we have investigated the effect of Rashba spin-orbitSO coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect will decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this side-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the persistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO coupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt jumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin current circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this system.","120"
"We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on electron-phonon e-p interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub-Kelvin temperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using sensitive normal metal-insulator-superconductor NIS tunnel junction thermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to clearly see the onset of the effects of two-dimensional 2D phonon system. We observed for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes the temperature dependence and strength of the e-p scattering rate, with the interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below sim 0.5 K for the 30 nm membranes.","118"
"A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.","104"
"Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr""olicher spaces by weakening the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that a closed Fr""olicher subspace A of the Fr""olicher space X is a smooth neighborhood deformation retract of X if and only if the inclusion i: Ahookrightarrow X comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an application we construct the right Puppe sequence.","110"
"We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid. The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load or the betweenness centrality. Through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading failures.","100"
"Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: proper', improper' and apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications. A non-intuitive length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out","111"
"The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of generalized' Maxwell's equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.","100"
"New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three flavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of constraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value of sin2 2theta_23 is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and masses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.","112"
"A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.","113"
"We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser. For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that for a long time evolution the performance of the gate properly estimated in terms of average fidelity increases. On the basis of this result, we compare holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage STIRAP gates.","109"
"We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of ntimes n banded Toeplitz matrices as nto infty. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly to a measure on this curve as ntoinfty. In this paper, we characterize the limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.","120"
"A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abelian group G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that TS  TS-2 holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theorem says only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup. This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of a certain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset for nonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory, extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs of Balandraud's results in the abelian case.","116"
"We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins.","105"
"We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants RSGs are dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra; RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers. We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.","111"
"Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.","106"
"We study pentaquark Theta I0,J12 in the QCD sum rules emphasizing that we can not extract any properties of the pentaquark outside of the Borel window. To find the appropriate Borel window, we prepare a favorable set up of the correlators and carry out the operator product expansion up to dimension 15 within factorization hypothesis. Our procedures reduce the unwanted high energy contaminations and enhance the low energy correlation. In the Borel window, independent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistent values of the Theta mass, 1.68pm0.22 GeV, and the residue. The parity is found to be it positive.","114"
"Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the corresponding right-handed slab with opposite permittivity and permeability so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.","110"
"As main result we show that for each g  1 there is some translation surface of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL2,Z. We use origamissquare-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is divided into two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis, Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 that their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a technique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups are decreasing. This is used to prove the main result.","109"
"An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter, so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae PNe is presented: i the theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface brightness is derived; ii contrary to the results obtained earlier for the Galactic supernova remnant SNR samples, our results show that the updated sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect - Malmquist bias same as for the extragalactic SNR samples and; iii we conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with unknown distances.","113"
"We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.","112"
"The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope KELT project is a survey for planetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small-aperture, wide-field automated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The telescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25 of the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8V10 mag, searching for transits by close-in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and software and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is able to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary transits around solar-type main sequence stars.","110"
"We probe turbulence structure from centimetric to metric scales by simultaneous imagery at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths at the VLT telescope and show that it departs significantly from the commonly used Kolmogorov model. The data can be fitted by the von Karman model with an outer scale of the order of 30 m and we see clear signs of the phase structure function saturation across the 8-m VLT aperture. The image quality improves in the infrared faster than the standard lambda-15 scaling and may be diffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even without adaptive optics at wavelengths longer than 8 micron.","102"
"We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency rf potential created from a static magnetic field B-field and a time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the atomic center of mass and an effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field, including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing adiabatic rf potentials.","120"
"We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov FFLO modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.","110"
"We present an analysis of the percolation transition for general node removal strategies valid for locally tree-like directed networks. On the basis of heuristic arguments we predict that, if the probability of removing node i is p_i, the network disintegrates if p_i is such that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with entries A_ij1-p_i is less than 1, where A is the adjacency matrix of the network. The knowledge or applicability of a Markov network model is not required by our theory, thus making it applicable to situations not covered by previous works. We test our predicted percolation criterion against numerical results for different networks and node removal strategies.","117"
"We construct a classical solution of an Einstein-Yang-Mills system with a fourth order term with respect to the field strength of the Yang-Mills field. The solution provides a spontaneous compactification proposed by Cremmer and Scherk; ten-dimensional space-time with a cosmological constant is compactified to the four-dimensional Minkowski space with a six-dimensional sphere S6 on which an instanton solution exists. The radius of the sphere is not a modulus but is determined by the gauge coupling and the four-derivative coupling constants and the Newton's constant. We also construct a solution of ten-dimensional theory without a cosmological constant compactified to AdS_4 x S6.","107"
"In this paper we study a class of backward stochastic differential equations BSDEs of the form dYt -AYtdt -f_0t,Ytdt -f_1t,Yt,Ztdt  ZtdWt on the interval 0,T, with given final condition at time T, in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H. The unbounded operator A is sectorial and dissipative and the nonlinearity f_0t,y is dissipative and defined for y only taking values in a subspace of H. A typical example is provided by the so-called polynomial nonlinearities. Applications are given to stochastic partial differential equations and spin systems.","100"
"In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogen molecule considered as a two interacting spin 12 qubit model. The entanglement related to the H_2 molecule is evaluated both using the von Neumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the corresponding quantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functions are examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numerical techniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a few years ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations are presented and discussed.","101"
"Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP. In addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central network component and a high clustering.","120"
"Let A,Theta be a principally polarised abelian variety, and let Y be a subvariety. Pareschi and Popa conjectured that Y has minimal cohomology class if and only if the structure sheaf of Y satisfies a property that they call M-regularity. Let now X be a smooth cubic threefold. By a classical result due to Clemens and Griffiths, its intermediate Jacobian JX is a principally polarised abelian variety; furthermore the Fano surface of lines on X can be embedded in JX and has minimal cohomology class. In this short note we show that its structure sheaf is M-regular.","107"
"We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its critical temperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be achieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation time is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from above. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the dependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not have to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the induced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.","107"
"Thermally stable polymers have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential use as the active component in electronic, optical and optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes, light emitting electrochemical cells, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, field effect transistors, optocouplers and optically pumped lasers in solution and solid state.We report results of investigations into the use of thermal treatment of polyp-phenylene vinylene PPV films grown on a variety of substrates quartz and glass. Film thickness, morphology and structural properties were investigated by a range of techniques in particular: atomic force microscope - AFM, DEKTAK method, Ellipsometry and UV-VIS spectroscopy.","111"
"The thermodynamics of nucleic acid processes is heavily affected by the electric double-layer of micro-ions around the polyions. We focus here on the Coulombic contribution to the salt-polyelectrolyte preferential interaction Donnan coefficient and we report extremely accurate analytical expressions valid in the range of low salt concentration when polyion radius is smaller than the Debye length. The analysis is performed at Poisson-Boltzmann level, in cylindrical geometry, with emphasis on highly charged poly-ions beyond counter-ion condensation''. The results hold for any electrolyte of the form z_-:z_. We also obtain a remarkably accurate expression for the electric potential in the vicinity of the poly-ion.","112"
"The carrier spin coherence in a p-doped GaAsAl,GaAs quantum well with a diluted hole gas has been studied by picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation with an in-plane magnetic field. For resonant optical excitation of the positively charged exciton the spin precession shows two types of oscillations. Fast oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing times up to 650 ps. The spin dephasing time as well as the in-plane hole g factor show strong temperature dependence, underlining the importance of hole localization at cryogenic temperatures.","109"
"We present the results of a muon-spin relaxation study of the high-Tc analogue material Cs2AgF4. We find unambiguous evidence for magnetic order, intrinsic to the material, below T_C13.953 K. The ratio of inter- to intraplane coupling is estimated to be J'J1.9 x 10-2, while fits of the temperature dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponent beta0.2923, implying an intermediate character between pure two- and three- dimensional magnetism in the critical regime. Above T_C we observe a signal characteristic of dipolar interactions due to linear F-mu-F bonds, allowing the muon stopping sites in this compound to be characterized.","107"
"This is a reply report to astro-ph0604264. We studied heavy element production in high baryon density region in early universe astro-ph0507439. However it is claimed in astro-ph0604264 that small scale but high baryon density region contradicts observations for the light element abundance or in order not to contradict to observations high density region must be so small that it cannot affect the present heavy element abundance. In this paper we study big bang nucleosynthesis in high baryon density region and show that in certain parameter spaces it is possible to produce enough amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element observations.","109"
"We have measured the polarizations of jpsi and psiprime mesons as functions of their transverse momentum pt when they are produced promptly in the rapidity range y0.6 with pt geq 5 pgev. The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 800 ipb collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as pt increases from 5 to 30 pgev. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of jpsi and psiprime mesons from B-hadron decays are also reported.","109"
"We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.","112"
"We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons which does not require cavities. It relies on the collective enhancement of light emission as a consequence of the presence of entanglement in atomic ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in cells at room temperature.","112"
"Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied. Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric fibration.","101"
"A complete set of polarization transfer observables has been measured for the 12rm Cp,n reaction at T_p296 rm MeV and theta_rm lab0circ. The total spin transfer Sigma0circ and the observable f_1 deduced from the measured polarization transfer observables indicate that the spin--dipole resonance at E_x simeq 7 rm MeV has greater 2- strength than 1- strength, which is consistent with recent experimental and theoretical studies. The results also indicate a predominance of the spin-flip and unnatural-parity transition strength in the continuum. The exchange tensor interaction at a large momentum transfer of Q simeq 3.6 rm fm-1 is discussed.","107"
"We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems. We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal. We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass. Finally, we discuss up to which extent these ideas apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to present.","115"
"The recently updated data of the twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations kHz QPOs in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries are analyzed. The power-law fitting nu_1anu_21000b and linear fitting nu_2Anu_1B are applied, individually, to the data points of four Z sources GX 172, GX 3400, GX 5-1 and Sco X-1 and four Atoll sources 4U 061409, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1728-34. The chi2-tests show that the power-law correlation and linear correlation both can fit data well. Moreover, the comparisons between the data and the theoretical models for kHz QPOs are discussed.","103"
"We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts. Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states. We find that the Al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy, leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer.","113"
"Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function NEGF method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials.","117"
"We present the expansion of the two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential TPE-3NP to chiral order q4, which corresponds to a subset of all possibilities at this order and is based on the piN amplitude at Oq3. Results encompass both numerical corrections to strength coefficients of previous Oq3 terms and new structures in the profile functions. The former are typically smaller than 10 whereas the latter arise from either loop functions or non-local gradients acting on the wave function. The influence of the new TPE-3NP over static and scattering three-body observables has been assessed and found to be small, as expected from perturbative corrections.","108"
"The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their structure.","108"
"The ghost and gluon propagator and the ghost-gluon and three-gluon vertex of two-dimensional SU2 Yang-Mills theory in minimal Landau gauge are studied using lattice gauge theory. It is found that the results are qualitatively similar to the ones in three and four dimensions. The propagators and the Faddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. In addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are investigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of the propagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization and Dyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purpose lattices of volume up to 42.7 fm2 have been used.","111"
"Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic junctions.","118"
"When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the transmitted image Padgett et al. 2006. We examine these two phenomena by extending an analysis of Player 1976 to general electromagnetic fields. We find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of the transmitted image.","110"
"We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis MF-DFA method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this view we find same second moment exponents after double profiling in ranges 1.7-1.8 in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.","109"
"We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of hep-th0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss further checks that need to be performed.","104"
"We apply results of Malliavin-Thalmaier-Watanabe for strong and weak Taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations SDEs. In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an easily tractable alternative to freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models, which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples underline the results.","117"
"We present an original statistical method to measure the visibility of interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.","109"
"The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed states is studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrence two pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the same entanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtained inequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even in infinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in terms of those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can find useful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a given pure state.","105"
"Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free energies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium trajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression dWdtpartial Hx,t partial t which connects the microscopic work W performed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding Hamiltonian Hx,t at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as it is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the implications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic molecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these limitations.","109"
"The critical adsorption point CAP of self-avoiding walks SAW interacting with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed by Soteros and Whittington J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325, that describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer adsorption.","115"
"We consider a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zero temperature.The atoms interact via a short range tunable attractive interaction. We demonstrate analytically a curious property of the gas at unitarity. Namely, the correlation energy of the gas, evaluated by second order perturbation theory, has the same density dependence as the first order exchange energy, and the two almost exactly cancel each other at Feshbach resonance irrespective of the shape of the potential, provided mu r_s  1. Here mu-1 is the range of the two-body potential, and r_s is defined through the number density n34pi r_s3. The implications of this result for universality is discussed.","118"

If A is a complex algebra, there is a group isomorphism K_0nA cong biglK_0Abigrn-1 for all n geq 2. However, for algebras over cyclotomic fields, this is not true in general. We consider K_0n as a covariant functor, and show that it is also functorial for a generalization of homomorphism called an emphn-homomorphism.","103"
"We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities, the electrons form a two-row zigzag Wigner crystal whose spin properties are determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three- and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the four-particle ring exchange.","104"
"Evaporation residue and fission cross sections of radioactive 132Sn on 64Ni were measured near the Coulomb barrier. A large sub-barrier fusion enhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelastic excitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in good agreement with the measured fusion excitation function. When the change in nuclear size and shift in barrier height are accounted for, there is no extra fusion enhancement in 132Sn64Ni with respect to stable Sn64Ni. A systematic comparison of evaporation residue cross sections for the fusion of even 112-124Sn and 132Sn with 64Ni is presented.","101"
"We give a detailed microscopic derivation of gauge and stringy instanton generated superpotentials for gauge theories living on D3-branes at Z_3-orientifold singularities. Gauge instantons are generated by D-1-branes and lead to Affleck, Dine and Seiberg ADS like superpotentials in the effective N1 gauge theories with three generations of bifundamental and antisymmetric matter. Stringy instanton effects are generated by Euclidean ED3-branes wrapping four-cycles on T6Z_3. They give rise to Majorana masses in one case and non-renormalizable superpotentials for the other cases. Finally we determine the conditions under which ADS like superpotentials are generated in N1 gauge theories with adjoints, fundamentals, symmetric and antisymmetric chiral matter.","112"
"This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.","114"
"In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized in units of Phi_0  frach2e. It is well known from the theory of Josephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave material, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to a additional phase shift of pi. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of geometric phase. We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and pure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that the phase shift of pi follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and is thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.","117"
"The COsmic Foreground Explorer COFE is a balloon-borne microwave polarime- ter designed to measure the low-frequency and low-l characteristics of dominant diffuse polarized foregrounds. Short duration balloon flights from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres will allow the telescope to cover up to 80 of the sky with an expected sensitivity per pixel better than 100 mu K  deg2 from 10 GHz to 20 GHz. This is an important effort toward characterizing the polarized foregrounds for future CMB experiments, in particular the ones that aim to detect primordial gravity wave signatures in the CMB polarization angular power spectrum.","101"
"Particle in cell PIC simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise, however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems, independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.","105"
"Mechanisms of whispering-gallery WG modes coupling in microdisk photonic molecules PMs with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical microresonators.","103"
"Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, the electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state is studied. It is shown that the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate superconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by the bilayer splitting, then the observed peak-dip-hump structure around the pi,0 point is mainly caused by this bilayer splitting, with the superconducting peak being related to the antibonding component, and the hump being formed by the bonding component. The spectral weight increases with increasing the doping concentration. In analogy to the normal state case, both electron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the pi,0 point.","120"
"The effective potential analysis indicates that, in a 3D two-flavor Gross-Neveu model in vacuum, depending on less or bigger than the critical value 23 of G_SH_P, where G_S and H_P are respectively the coupling constants of scalar quark-antiquark channel and pseudoscalar diquark channel, the system will have the ground state with pure diquark condensates or with pure quark-antiquark condensates, but no the one with coexistence of the two forms of condensates. The similarities and differences in the interplay between the quark-antiquark and the diquark condensates in vacuum in the 2D, 3D and 4D two-flavor four-fermion interaction models are summarized.","107"
"We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the performance gains offered by random network coding.","120"
"The left-right twin HiggsLRTH model predicts the existence of the charged Higgs phipm. In this paper, we study the production of the charged Higgs boson phi- with single top quark via the process bgto tphi- at the CERN Large Hadron ColliderLHC. The numerical results show that the production cross section can reach the level of 10 pb in the reasonable parameter space of the LRTH model. We expect that, as long as it is not too heavy, the possible signatures of the heavy charged Higgs boson phi- might be detected via the decay mode phi-to bartb at the LHC experiments.","107"
"On the basis of the Fermi liquid theory, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio Agamma2 is evaluated by using a first principle band calculation for typical itinerant d and f electron systems. It is found as observed that the ratio for the d electron systems is significantly smaller than the normal f systems, even without considering their relatively weak correlation. The difference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermi surfaces. By comparing Pd and USn_3 as typical cases, we discuss the importance of the Fermi surface dependence of the quasiparticle transport relaxation.","100"
"A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show that a perfect Penrose tiling PPT layer can be grown on a decapod tiling layer by a three dimensional 3D local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D, contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.","111"
"The intercombination line of Strontium at 689nm is successfully used in laser cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a magneto-optical traps MOT. In this paper we present a systematic study of the loading efficiency of such a MOT. Comparing the experimental results to a simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal directions. At large laser detuning, one finds an unusual situation where cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.","117"
"We study the relationship between transfinite diameter, Chebyshev constant and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.","100"
"The low energy spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess components beside the power-law dependence. The consequences of such a feature allows to estimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the BATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and the estimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for the long bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z4, while for the the faint long bursts - which should be up to z20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguously with this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts with known optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma photometric redshift distribution.","120"
"A narrow elliptic ring containing an electron threaded by a magnetic field B is studied. When the ring is highly flattened, the increase of B would lead to a big energy gap between the ground and excited states, and therefore lead to a strong emission of dipole photons. The photon frequency can be tuned in a wide range by changing B andor the shape of the ellipse. The particle density is found to oscillate from a pattern of distribution to another pattern back and forth against B. This is a new kind of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation originating from symmetry breaking and is different from the usual oscillation of persistent current.","116"
"Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star retains measures of the initial heavy-element metal abundance that can be used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass exo-planets.","115"
"Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state w holds a key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the matter density parameter Omega_m and the dimensionless Hubble parameter h, we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.","113"
"In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with the zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass of the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge couplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial deviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are suppressed by a factor cos theta_H from the values in the standard model, where theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can be tested at LHC and ILC.","113"
"Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer FUSE has made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are reduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and archived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope MAST. The data-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over the lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been reprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper describes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and the format of the resulting calibrated data files.","111"
"Using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a many-body Peierls'' state.","119"
"A parametric study of so-called ""super growth"" of single-walled carbon nanotubesSWNTs was done by using combinatorial libraries of ironaluminum oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer about 0.5 nm were SWNTs. Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates.","110"
"The energy spectra of neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles have been measured from the d59Co and 3He58Fe reactions leading to the same compound nucleus, 61Ni. The experimental cross sections have been compared to Hauser-Feshbach model calculations using different input level density models. None of them have been found to agree with experiment. It manifests the serious problem with available level density parameterizations especially those based on neutron resonance spacings and density of discrete levels. New level densities and corresponding Fermi-gas parameters have been obtained for reaction product nuclei such as 60Ni,60Co, and 57Fe.","101"
"Three-body decays of resonant states are studied using integral formulae for decay widths. Theoretical approach with a simplified Hamiltonian allows semianalytical treatment of the problem. The model is applied to decays of the first excited 32- state of 17Ne and the 32- ground state of 45Fe. The convergence of three-body hyperspherical model calculations to the exact result for widths and energy distributions are studied. The theoretical results for 17Ne and 45Fe decays are updated and uncertainties of the derived values are discussed in detail. Correlations for the decay of 17Ne 32- state are also studied.","101"
"We investigate the approach to stable and metastable equilibrium in Ising models using a cluster representation. The distribution of nucleation times is determined using the Metropolis algorithm and the corresponding phi4 model using Langevin dynamics. We find that the nucleation rate is suppressed at early times even after global variables such as the magnetization and energy have apparently reached their time independent values. The mean number of clusters whose size is comparable to the size of the nucleating droplet becomes time independent at about the same time that the nucleation rate reaches its constant value. We also find subtle structural differences between the nucleating droplets formed before and after apparent metastable equilibrium has been established.","120"
"The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps. Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one consider maps that are ergodic.","107"
"We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U1 charges of appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.","119"
"In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main results in 1. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.","102"
"We present results on two-particle angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at center of mass energies of 200 and 410 GeV. The PHOBOS experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has a uniquely large coverage for charged particles, giving the opportunity to explore the correlations at both short- and long-range scales. At both energies, a complex two-dimensional correlation structure in Delta eta and Delta phi is observed. In the context of an independent cluster model of short-range correlations, the cluster size and its decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation function and compared with previous measurements in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions, as well as PYTHIA and HIJING predictions.","117"
"In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Let M be the matrix of the amplitudes of ketpsi, we prove M is a compact operator. We also prove ketpsi is separable if and only if M is a bounded linear operator with rank 1, that is the image of M is a one dimensional Hilbert space. So we have related the separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces to an important class of bounded linear operators in Functional analysis which has many interesting properties.","107"
"Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have studied the Raman-active tangential modes TMs of a 10, 0 single-wall carbon nanotube SWNT under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value , a constant value , and a negative value  above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to D2h then to C2h.","120"
"We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system atoms or quantum dots and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.","105"
"Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic definition of the concept of a mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a given set S of states onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.","120"
"We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementary particles, with a length scale 1Lambda, can leave observable effects of non-locality and causality violation at higher energies but lesssim Lambda. We formulate a model-independent approach based on Bogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation between the fundamental theory of finer constituents and the derived theory of composite particles. We assume that the fundamental theory is causal and formulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to be causal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil and which violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating amplitudes can arise.","116"
"Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL2,F. When V is the tensor product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most 1.","112"
"We report a measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0-Ks pi pi- decays using a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis. We first assume CP conservation and subsequently allow for CP violation.

"We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic properties of the reduction of Zwiebach invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants. It generalizes the Barannikov-Kontsevich construction to the case of higher genera correlators with gravitational descendants. We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel conceptual proof.","109"
"Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of patterns is the delta function.","109"
"We compute the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-12 Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with high-temperature expansions and exact diagonalizations. We compare the results with the experimental data on ZnCu3OH6Cl2 obtained by Helton et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 107204 2007. Down to k_BTJ0.2, our calculations reproduce accurately the experimental susceptibility, with an exchange interaction J190K and a contribution of 3.7 of weakly interacting impurity spins. The comparison between our calculations of the specific heat and the experiments indicate that the low-temperature entropy below 20K is smaller in ZnCu3OH6Cl2 than in the kagome Heisenberg model, a likely signature of other interactions in the system.","119"

"We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic intersection theory of Gillet and Soul'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of Bost-Gillet-Soul'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise.","115"
"Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3 film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated 100 SrTiO3 substrate. The resulting KO1-TiO20 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according to formal valences of K 1 and Ti 4. We observed electrical conductivity and mobility in the KTaO3SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in electron-doped LaAlO3SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge carriers in KTaO3SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite oxide hetero-interfaces.","112"
"It is shown that a graphene ribbon, a ballistic strip of carbon monolayer, may serve as a quantum wire whose electronic properties can be continuously and reversibly controlled by an externally applied transverse voltage. The electron bands of armchair-edge ribbons undergo dramatic transformations: The Fermi surface fractures, Fermi velocity and effective mass change sign, and excitation gaps are reduced by the transverse field. These effects are manifest in the conductance plateaus, van Hove singularities, thermopower, and activated transport. The control over one-dimensional bands may help enhance effects of electron correlations, and be utilized in device applications.","109"
"The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars, essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular, we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are due to non-equilibrium beta-processes such as modified or direct Urca process. The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.","108"

A bound pentaquark Theta can only be obtained with unphysically strong vector mesonic coupling constants.","101"
"We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums of channels or states for which we show how to obtain several information theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple and general tool for lifting additivity results.","115"
"We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques. Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is estimated to be a few nK.","110"
"We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium. The general nature of the solution is similar to the ""Bondi solution"", but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars.","119"

Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields, we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain non-co-moving frames.","108"

"A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This triple unification' may shed new light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but also on dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and inflation.","115"

The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity Kolmogorov Complexity, for short. I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin algorithmic Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.","109"
"A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the Hubble scale at the transition.","119"

It is thus of interest to understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among one million users of an interactive website -- textttdigg.com -- devoted to thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law, suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.","110"
"Insulating La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 shares with superconducting cuprates the same Fincher-Burke-like spin excitations, which usually are observed in itinerant antiferromagnets. The local spectral function satisfies omegaT scaling above 16 K for this incommensurate insulating cuprate. Together with previous results in commensurate insulating and incommensurate superconducting cuprates, these results further support the general scaling prediction for square-lattice quantum spin S12 systems. The width of incommensurate peaks in La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 scales to a similar finite value as at optimal doping, strongly suggesting that they are similarly distant from a quantum critical point. They might both be limited to a finite correlation length by the partial spin-glass freezing.","110"
"We consider reaction-diffusion equations with combustion-type non-linearities in two dimensions and study speed-up of their pulsating fronts by general periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure. We show that the occurence of front speed-up in the sense lim_Atoinfty c_Ainfty, with A the amplitude of the flow and c_A the minimal front speed, only depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function. In particular, front speed-up happens for KPP reactions if and only if it does for ignition reactions. We also show that the flows which achieve this speed-up are precisely those which, when scaled properly, are able to quench any ignition reaction.","116"
"We report Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of eleven externally-polluted white dwarfs. Of the nine stars for which we have IRAC photometry, we find that GD 40, GD 133 and PG 1015161 each has an infrared excess that can be understood as arising from a flat, opaque, dusty disk. GD 56 also has an infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the atmosphere of GD 40 are the result of accretion of a tidally-disrupted asteroid with a chondritic composition.","119"
"We study the dynamical process of disentanglement of two qubits and two qutrits coupled to an Ising spin chain in a transverse field, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. We use the concurrence and negativity to quantify entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections between the concurrence negativity and the decoherence factors are given for two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner state. We find that the concurrence and negativity decay exponentially with fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental system.","102"
"When ultrathin metal films are subjected to multiple cycles of rapid melting and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the ensuing length scales when Co films 1-8 nm thick on SiO_text2 surfaces are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform interference laser irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing, lambda_NN2.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_0leq2 nm, a hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation of nanoparticles.","120"
"A cylindrical wave expansion method is developed to obtain the scattering field for an ideal two-dimensional cylindrical invisibility cloak. A near-ideal model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the inner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal material parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying the change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal one. However, due to the slow convergence of the zeroth order scattering coefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field scattering and penetration.","106"
"We examine the quantitative condition which has been widely used as a criterion for the adiabatic approximation but was recently found insufficient. Our results indicate that the usual quantitative condition is sufficient for a special class of quantum mechanical systems. For general systems, it may not be sufficient, but it along with additional conditions is sufficient. The usual quantitative condition and the additional conditions constitute a general criterion for the validity of the adiabatic approximation, which is applicable to all N-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we illustrate the use of the general quantitative criterion in some physical models.","106"
"Phase singularities as topological objects of wave fields appear in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological scenarios. In this paper, by making use of the phi-mapping topological current theory, we study the topological properties of the phase singularities in two and three dimensional space in details. The topological inner structure of the phase singularities are obtained, and the topological charge of the phase singularities are expressed by the topological numbers: Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. Furthermore, the topological invariant of the closed and knotted phase singularities in three dimensional space are also discussed in details.","107"
"We study the distribution of finite size pseudo-critical points in a one-dimensional random quantum magnet with a quantum phase transition described by an infinite randomness fixed point. Pseudo-critical points are defined in three different ways: the position of the maximum of the average entanglement entropy, the scaling behavior of the surface magnetization, and the energy of a soft mode. All three lead to a log-normal distribution of the pseudo-critical transverse fields, where the width scales as L-1nu with nu2 and the shift of the average value scales as L-1nu_typ with nu_typ1, which we related to the scaling of average and typical quantities in the critical region.","114"
"The inclusive energy distributions of the complex fragments 3 leq Z leq 7 emitted from the bombardment of 12C by 20Ne beams with incident energies between 145 and 200 MeV have been measured in the angular range 10o leq theta_lab leq 50o. Damped fragment yields in all the cases have been found to be the characteristic of emission from fully energy equilibrated composites. The binary fragment yields are compared with the standard statistical model predictions. Enhanced yields of entrance channel fragments 5 leq Z leq 7 indicate the survival of orbiting-like process in 20Ne  12C system at these energies.","103"
"All realistic potential models for the two-nucleon interaction are to some extent based on boson exchange. However, in order to achieve an essentially perfect fit to the scattering data, characterized by a chi2Ndata  1, previous potentials have abandoned a pure one boson-exchange mechanism OBE. Using a covariant theory, we have found a OBE potential that fits the 2006 world np data below 350 MeV with a chi2Ndata  1.06 for 3788 data. Our potential has fewer adjustable parameters than previous high-precision potentials, and also reproduces the experimental triton binding energy without introducing additional irreducible three-nucleon forces.","104"
"A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization. Relations between symmetries of this theory and the Od,d symmetry of the string-inspired models are discussed.","115"
"Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta. However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite, tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the opposite sign to the wino mass.","114"
"Suzaku observations of two hard X-ray  10 keV selected nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies are presented. Both sources were clearly detected with the PIN Hard X-ray Detector up to several tens of keV, allowing for a fairly good characterization of the broad band X-ray continuum. Both sources are heavily obscured, one of which NGC 5728 being Compton thick, while at lower energies the shape and intensity of the scatteredreflected continuum is very different. Strong iron Kalpha lines are detected in both sources. There are also hints for the presence of a broad relativistic iron line in NGC 4992.","105"
"We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized un- certainty principle GUP on black holes thermodynamics. We calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant BHR. In particular we obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading order in the Planck length.","108"
"Simple geometrical considerations show that the collision zone in high energy nuclear collisions may be divided into a central part core'', with high energy densities, and a peripheral part corona'', with smaller energy densities, more like in pp or pA collisions. We present calculations which allow to separate these two contributions, and which show that the corona contribution is quite small but not negligible for central collisions, but gets increasingly important with decreasing centrality. We will discuss consequences concerning results obtained in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC and the Super Proton Synchrotron SPS.","109"
"We give a simple geometric proof that e is irrational, using a construction of a nested sequence of closed intervals with intersection e. The proof leads to a new measure of irrationality for e: if p and q are integers with q  1, then e - pq  1Sq1!, where Sq is the smallest positive integer such that Sq! is a multiple of q. We relate this measure for e to a known one and to the greatest prime factor of an integer. We make two conjectures and recall a theorem of Cantor that can be proved by a similar construction.","109"
"The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson, becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode. The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.","112"
"Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after ""big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2 galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGNquasar population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN, focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.","116"
"Recent X-ray surveys have provided a large number of high-luminosity, obscured Active Galactic Nuclei AGN, the so-called Type 2 quasars. Despite the large amount of multi-wavelength supporting data, the main parameters related to the black holes harbored in such AGN are still poorly known. Here we present the results obtained for a sample of eight Type 2 quasars in the redshift range 0.9-2.1 selected from the HELLAS2XMM survey, for which we used Ks-band, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS data at 24 micron to estimate bolometric corrections, black hole masses, and Eddington ratios.","101"
"Low density lattice codes LDLC are novel lattice codes that can be decoded efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise AWGN channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message vector b, i.e., x  Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse. The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error performance within 0.5dB from capacity at block length of n  100,000 symbols. The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.","119"
"Microfluidic chips have been fabricated to study electrokinetic pumping generated by a low voltage AC signal applied to an asymmetric electrode array. A measurement procedure has been established and followed carefully resulting in a high degree of reproducibility of the measurements. Depending on the ionic concentration as well as the amplitude of the applied voltage, the observed direction of the DC flow component is either forward or reverse. The impedance spectrum has been thoroughly measured and analyzed in terms of an equivalent circuit diagram. Our observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with theoretical models published in the literature.","106"
"In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the Markov-switching multifractal model MSM. In order to see how well the estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and compare the scaling exponents Hq for q  1, 2 for both empirical data and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal model appears to generate apparent' long memory in agreement with the empirical scaling laws.","107"

The 1.3m SkyMapper telescope features a 5.7 square degree field-of-view Cassegrain imager and will see first light in late 2007. The primary goal of the facility is to conduct the Southern Sky Survey a six colour, six epoch survey of the southern sky. The survey will provide photometry for objects between 8th and 23rd magnitude with global photometric accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data.","113"
"Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk. We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of the ""Central Limit Theorem"" useful to study large portfolio losses. Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis.","115"
"We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends upon the solution of an elliptic equation and upon harmonic functions. Starting with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere. Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.","102"
"We study an efficient dynamic blind source separation algorithm of convolutive sound mixtures based on updating statistical information in the frequency domain, andminimizing the support of time domain demixing filters by a weighted least square method. The permutation and scaling indeterminacies of separation, and concatenations of signals in adjacent time frames are resolved with optimization of l1 times linfty norm on cross-correlation coefficients at multiple time lags. The algorithm is a direct method without iterations, and is adaptive to the environment. Computations on recorded and synthetic mixtures of speech and music signals show excellent performance.","102"
"The time dependent entropy or Leipnik's entropy of harmonic and damped harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave function obtained by the Feynman path integral method. Our results for simple harmonic oscillator are in agrement with the literature. However, the joint entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the general properties of the envelop of the joint entropy curve for quantum systems.","100"
"One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D""ur-Cirac DC method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems, there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled fraction is less than or equal to 12 is always transformed into a separable state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial transposition.","116"
"In 1948, W. Hoeffding introduced a large class of unbiased estimators called U-statistics, defined as the average value of a real-valued k-variate function h calculated at all possible sets of k points from a random sample. In the present paper we investigate the corresponding extreme value analogue, which we shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample. U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric invariants.","105"
"An accurate experimental investigation on the Mpemba effect that is, the freezing of initially hot water before cold one is carried out, showing that in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 - 1 oC, 3.5 - 0.5 oC and 1.3 - 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.","120"
"We introduce a novel extension of the Gutzwiller variational wavefunction able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we find that: 1 the Mott transition is first order; 2 the Peierls gap is large in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron repulsion; 3 singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.","112"
"We present a perturbative calculation of the neutron matter equation of state based on low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions. Our results are compared to the model-independent virial equation of state and to variational calculations, and we provide theoretical error estimates by varying the cutoff used to regulate nuclear interactions. In addition, we study the dependence of the BCS 1S_0 superfluid pairing gap on nuclear interactions and on the cutoff. The resulting gaps are well constrained by the nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, and the cutoff dependence is very weak for sharp or sufficiently narrow smooth regulators with cutoffs lm  1.6 fmi.","107"
"We study the constraints that the operator product expansion imposes on large N_c inspired QCD models for current-current correlators. We focus on the constraints obtained by going beyond the leading-order parton computation. We explicitly show that, assumed a given mass spectrum: linear Regge behavior in n the principal quantum number plus corrections in 1n, we can obtain the logarithmic and constant behavior in n of the decay constants within a systematic expansion in 1n. Our example shows that it is possible to have different large n behavior for the vector and pseudo-vector mass spectrum and yet comply with all the constraints from the operator product expansion.","113"
"We conjecture that because of color confinement, the physical vacuum forms an event horizon for quarks and gluons which can be crossed only by quantum tunneling, i.e., through the QCD counterpart of Hawking radiation by black holes. Since such radiation cannot transmit information to the outside, it must be thermal, of a temperature determined by the chromodynamic force at the confinement surface, and it must maintain color neutrality. We explore the possibility that the resulting process provides a common mechanism for thermal hadron production in high energy interactions, from ee- annihilation to heavy ion collisions.","106"
"We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current shot noise in the presence of a voltage time-modulation. For a non-interacting metal, it is known that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems: 1 a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative, with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2 a carbon nanotube for which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.","115"
"We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of the standard field-theoretical treatment of vacuum energy and discuss the relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous symmetry breaking. We suggest possible extensions of the 't Hooft-Nobbenhuis symmetry, in particular, its complexification till duality symmetry and discuss the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be responsible for a small observable value of this constant.","111"
"We investigate the physical property of the kappa parameter and the kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.","114"
"We construct a new giant graviton solution in AdS_5 x Y_5, with Y_5 a quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold, consisting on a Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped around the Y_5 and with its Taub-NUT direction in AdS_5. We find that this configuration has minimal energy when put in the centre of AdS_5, where it behaves as a massless particle. When we take Y_5 to be S5, we provide a microscopical description in terms of multiple gravitational waves expanding into the fuzzy S5 defined as an S1 bundle over the fuzzy CP2. Finally we provide a possible field theory dual interpretation of the construction.","107"
"The AlPdMn quasicrystal approximants xi, xi', and xi'_n of the 1.6 nm decagonal phase and R, T, and T_n of the 1.2 nm decagonal phase can be viewed as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial dislocations.","110"
"We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of two samples of evolved stars selected in the field and in the intermediate-age open cluster IC 4651, for which detailed measurements of chemical composition were made in the last few years. Applying the Gray's method based on ratios of line depths, we determine the effective temperature and compare our results with previous ones obtained by means of the curves of growth of iron lines. The knowledge of the temperature enables us to estimate other fundamental stellar parameters, such as color excess, age, and mass.","100"
"We consider an initial Eve-population and a population of neutral mutants, such that the total population dies out in finite time. We describe the evolution of the Eve-population and the total population with continuous state branching processes, and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population. First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree, according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total population.","115"
"The classical characterization of wp, as a typical concept for far field phenomena, has been successfully applied to many w phenomena in past decades. The recent reports of superluminal tunnelling times and negative group velocities challenged this concept. A new local approach for the definition of wvs avoiding these difficulties while including the classical definitions as particular cases is proposed here. This generalisation of the conventional non-local approach can be applied to arbitrary w forms and propagation media. Some applications of the formalism are presented and basic properties of the concept are summarized.","100"
"We consider pattern containment and avoidance with a very tight definition that was used first by Riordan more than 60 years ago. Using this definition, we prove the monotone pattern is easier to avoid than almost any other pattern of the same length. We also show that with this definition, almost all patterns of length k are avoided by the same number of permutations of length n. The corresponding statements are not known to be true for more relaxed definitions of pattern containment. This is the first time we know of that expectations are used to compare numbers of permutations avoiding certain patterns.","109"
"Using low energy Time-of-Flight Scattering and Recoil Spectroscopy TOF-SARS and Mass Spectroscopy of Recoiled Ions MSRI we analyze the surface structure of an atomically smooth BaBiO_3 film grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We demonstrate high sensitivity of the TOF-SARS and MSRI spectra to slight changes in the orientation of the ion scattering plane with respect to the crystallographic axes. The observed angle dependence allows us to clearly identify the termination layer as BiO_2. Our data also indicate that angle-resolved MSRI data can be used for high resolution studies of surface structure of complex oxide thin films.","100"
"We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse radial wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.","113"
"We show that r-mode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond pulsars are rare.","105"
"This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood ratio test GLRT. The computational complexity is polynomial in the block length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation. We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission PAT. The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.","108"
"Superconducting and normal-state properties of the beta-pyrochlore oxide KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.","109"
"The transverse mass spectra and the rapidity distributions of pi and pi- in Au-Au collisions at 2, 4, 6, and 8 GeVcdotA by E895 collaboration are fitted using an elliptically expanding fireball model with the contribution from the resonance decays and the final state Coulomb interaction. The ratio of the total number of produced pi- and pi is used to fit the data. The resulting freeze-out temperature is rather lowT_f  60 MeV with large transverse flow and thus resonance contribution is very small. The difference in the shape of m_t spectra of the oppositely charged pions are found to be due to the Coulomb interaction of the pions.","115"
"We describe a novel switching algorithm based on a reverse'' Monte Carlo method, in which the potential is stochastically modified before the system configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. The roughening transition in the sine-Gordon model has been studied with this method, and high-accuracy simulations for system sizes up to 10242 were carried out to examine the logarithmic divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature, revealing clear evidence for universal scaling of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type.","114"
"Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.","112"
"P.J.Cameron introduced the orbit algebra of a permutation group and conjectured that this algebra is an integral domain if and only if the group has no finite orbit. We prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the age algebra of a relational structure R is an integral domain if and only if R is age-inexhaustible. We deduce these results from a combinatorial lemma asserting that if a product of two non-zero elements of a set algebra is zero then there is a finite common tranversal of their supports. The proof is built on Ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle algebra.","108"
"A new public conveyance model applicable to buses and trains is proposed in this paper by using stochastic cellular automaton. We have found the optimal density of vehicles, at which the average velocity becomes maximum, significantly depends on the number of stops and passengers behavior of getting on a vehicle at stops. The efficiency of the hail-and-ride system is also discussed by comparing the different behavior of passengers. Moreover, we have found that a big cluster of vehicles is divided into small clusters, by incorporating information of the number of vehicles between successive stops.","102"
"Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple constant source function and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet chromosphere, such as mottlesspicules, as well as for active region structures such as fibrils, arch filament systems AFS, filaments and flares.","113"
"We propose a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes.","106"
"We prove that a compact quantum group is coamenable if and only if its corepresentation ring is amenable. We further propose a Foelner condition for compact quantum groups and prove it to be equivalent to coamenability. Using this Foelner condition, we prove that for a coamenable compact quantum group with tracial Haar state, the enveloping von Neumann algebra is dimension flat over the Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients. This generalizes a theorem of Lueck from the group case to the quantum group case, and provides examples of compact quantum groups with vanishing L2-Betti numbers.","101"
"We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.","115"

The observations were obtained during a coordinated observing campaign on October 2005. The aim of this work is to present the rich diversity of fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their appearance in different instruments and different spectral lines that span the photosphere to the corona. Detailed studies of these structures are crucial to understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.","114"
"Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and second row of the periodic table is obtained.","109"
"We consider the development of Cooper pairs in a self-consistent Hartree Fock mean field for the even Sm isotopes. Results are presented at the level of a BCS treatment, a number-projected BCS treatment and an exact treatment using the Richardson ansatz. While projected BCS captures much of the pairing correlation energy that is absent from BCS, it still misses a sizable correlation energy, typically of order 1 MeV. Furthermore, because it does not average over the properties of the fermion pairs, the exact Richardson solution permits a more meaningful definition of the Cooper wave function and of the fraction of pairs that are collective.","113"
"We consider a two-dimensional 2D nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The variational approximation VA predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of 2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking SSB of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.","101"
"We show that holographic models of QCD predict the presence of a Chern-Simons coupling between vector and axial-vector mesons at finite baryon density. In the AdSCFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the baryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional holographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons, the coupling mixes transverse rho and a_1 polarization states. At sufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which causes the rho and a_1 mesons to condense in a state breaking both rotational and translational invariance.","104"
"In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.","110"
"Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course, we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to column vectors kets and that differential operators correspond to matrices ket-bras acting on those vectors. The MATLAB matrix-laboratory programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.","105"
"The magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional Ising spin glasses are controversial. Using exact ground state determination, we extract the properties of clusters flipped when increasing continuously a uniform field. We show that these clusters have many holes but otherwise have statistical properties similar to those of zero-field droplets. A detailed analysis gives for the magnetization exponent delta  1.30 - 0.02 using lattice sizes up to 80x80; this is compatible with the droplet model prediction delta  1.282. The reason for previous disagreements stems from the need to analyze both singular and analytic contributions in the low-field regime.","103"
"In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons, forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.","116"
"When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible with the Holographic Principle.","116"
"In order to popularize the so called Schwinger's method we reconsider the Feynman propagator of two non-relativistic systems: a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field and a charged harmonic oscillator in a uniform magnetic field. Instead of solving the Heisenberg equations for the position and the canonical momentum operators, bf R and bf P, we apply this method by solving the Heisenberg equations for the gauge invariant operators bf R and mathversionboldpi  bf P-ebf A, the latter being the mechanical momentum operator. In our procedure we avoid fixing the gauge from the beginning and the result thus obtained shows explicitly the gauge dependence of the Feynman propagator.","116"
"We construct smooth asymptotically AdS_5xS5 solutions of Type IIB supergravity corresponding to all the half-BPS surface operators in N4 SYM. All the parameters labeling a half-BPS surface operator are identified in the corresponding bubbling geometry. We use the supergravity description of surface operators to study the action of the SL2,Z duality group of N4 SYM on the parameters of the surface operator, and find that it coincides with the recent proposal by Gukov and Witten in the framework of the gauge theory approach to the geometrical Langlands with ramification. We also show that whenever a bubbling geometry becomes singular that the path integral description of the corresponding surface operator also becomes singular.","119"
"Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe, even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.","113"
"We argue about a possible scenario of physical reality based on the parallelism between Poincare group and the sunyata philosophy of Nagarjuna. The notion of ""relational"" is the common denominator of two views. We have approached the relational concept in third-person perspective ontic level. It is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open the questions: iwe must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility to extract completeness information? iiwe must abandon the idea to infer a possible structure of physical reality?","102"
"The motivations to make ultraviolet UV studies of supernovae SNe are reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for ""dark energy"" that seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed.","113"
"Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.","119"
"Electron-electron interactions give rise to the correction, deltasigmaintomega, to the ac magnetoconductivity, sigmaomega, of a clean 2D electron gas that is periodic in omega_c-1, where omega_c is the cyclotron frequency. Unlike conventional harmonics of the cyclotron resonance, which are periodic with omega, this correction is periodic with omega32. Oscillations in deltasigmaintomega develop at low magnetic fields, omega_cllomega, when the conventional harmonics are suppressed by the disorder. Their origin is a em double backscattering of an electron from the impurity-induced Friedel oscillations. During the time simomega-1 between the two backscattering events the electron travels only a em small portion of the Larmour circle.","116"
"A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0.001.","113"
"We consider the transverse Ising model in one dimension with nearest-neighbour interaction and calculate exactly the longitudinal spin-spin correlation for a class of excited states. These states are known to play an important role in the perturbative treatment of one-dimensional transverse Ising model with frustrated second-neighbour interaction. To calculate the correlation, we follow the earlier procedure of Wu, use Szego's theorem and also use Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. The result is that the correlation decays algebraically with distance n as 1surd n and is oscillatory or non-oscillatory depending on the magnitude of the transverse field.","100"
"Motivated by recent Hall-effect experiment in YbRh_2Si_2, we study ground state properties of a Kondo lattice model in a two-dimensional square lattice using variational Monte Carlo method. We show that there are two types of phase transition, antiferromagnetic transition and topological one Fermi surface reconstruction. In a wide region of parameters, these two transitions occur simultaneously without the breakdown of Kondo screening, accompanied by a discontinuous change of the Hall coefficient. This result is consistent with the experiment and gives a novel theoretical picture for the quantum critical point in heavy fermion systems.","101"
"We develop a class of soliton solution of it linear Schr""odinger equation without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr""odinger equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.","107"
"The gravitational field equations on cosmological scales are obtained by averaging the Einstein field equations of general relativity. By assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales, the local inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction backreaction terms, which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models. The effects of averaging on cosmological observations are discussed. It is argued that, based on estimates from observational data, the backreaction and, in particular, the averaged spatial curvature can have a very significant dynamical effect on the evolution of the Universe and must be taken into account in observational cosmology.","111"
"Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition, the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.","116"
"This is the first in a series of papers in which we study vertex-algebraic structure of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's principal subspaces associated to standard modules for both untwisted and twisted affine Lie algebras. A key idea is to prove suitable presentations of principal subspaces, without using bases or even small'' spanning sets of these spaces. In this paper we prove presentations of the principal subspaces of the basic A_11-modules. These convenient presentations were previously used in work of Capparelli-Lepowsky-Milas for the purpose of obtaining the classical Rogers-Ramanujan recursion for the graded dimensions of the principal subspaces.","101"
"We present the first high-resolution, ground-based observations of HCN and C2H2 toward the T Tauri binary star system GV Tau. We detected strong absorption due to HCN nu_3 and weak C2H2 nu_3 and nu_2  nu_4  nu_50_ absorption toward the primary GV Tau S but not the infrared companion. We also report CO column densities and rotational temperatures, and present abundances relative to CO of HCNCO 0.6 and C2H2CO 1.2 and an upper limit for CH4CO  0.37 toward GV Tau S. Neither HCN nor C2H2 were detected toward the infrared companion and results suggest that abundances may differ between the two sources.","106"
"In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered mechanism involves two types of iron minerals magnetite and maghemite which were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.","110"
"We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo.","115"
"We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions, that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells, are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar","110"
"Photoproduction of pi0 mesons was studied with the Crystal-Barrel detector at ELSA for incident energies from 300 MeV to 3 GeV. Differential cross sections d sigma d Omega, d sigmad t, and the total cross section are presented. For Egamma  3 GeV, the angular distributions agree well with the SAID parametrization. At photon energies above 1.5 GeV, a strong forward peaking indicates t-channel exchange to be the dominant process. The rapid variations of the cross section with energy and angle indicate production of resonances. An interpretation of the data within the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis is briefly discussed.","108"

Under the quenched law i.e., conditioned on the environment, we show that no limit laws are possible: There exist sequences n_k and x_k depending on the environment only, such that X_n_k-x_kolog n_k2 a localized regime. On the other hand, there exist sequences t_m and s_m depending on the environment only, such that log s_mlog t_mto s1 and P_omegaX_t_ms_mleq xto12 for all x0 and to0 for xleq0 a spread out regime.","119"
"We define the Euler number of a bipartite graph on n vertices to be the number of labelings of the vertices with 1,2,...,n such that the vertices alternate in being local maxima and local minima. We reformulate the problem of computing the Euler number of certain subgraphs of the Cartesian product of a graph G with the path P_m in terms of self adjoint operators. The asymptotic expansion of the Euler number is given in terms of the eigenvalues of the associated operator. For two classes of graphs, the comb graphs and the Cartesian product P_2 Box P_m, we numerically solve the eigenvalue problem.","114"
"Aiming at a microscopic description of heavy ion collisions in the beam energy region of about 10 A GeV, we extend the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck GiBUU transport model by including a relativistic mean field, in-medium baryon-baryon cross sections and three-body collisions. The model is then compared with experimental data for central AuAu collisions at 2-10 A GeV and central PbPb collisions at 30 and 40 A GeV on the proton rapidity spectra, the midrapidity yields of pi, Kpm and LambdaSigma0, and the transverse mass spectra of pipm and Kpm. The three-body collisions increase the inverse slope parameters of the hadron m_perp-spectra to a good agreement with the data.","115"
"We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum gravitational Planck scale effects lead to an effective SU2_Ltimes U1 invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects.","112"
"This paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of highly-committed, well-connected opinion leaders endowed with a strong convincing power. Each individual, located at a vertex of a directed graph, is characterized by her name, the list of people she is interacting with, her level of awareness, and her opinion. Various temporal evolutions according to different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the formation of strongly polarized subgroups, each adopting the opinion of one of the two groups of opinion leaders, is favored.","112"
"Derivation of the full set of Bell inequalities involving correlation functions, for two parties, with binary observables, and N possible local settings is not as easy as it seemed. The proof of v1 is wrong. Additionaly one can find a counterexample, which will be presented soon. Thus our thesis is dead. Still the series of Bell inequalities discussed in the manuscript v1 form a necessary condition for local realism, and are tight. They are tight and complete sufficient only for N3 settings per observer as shown in quant-ph0611086, fortunately using an entirely different approach.","106"
"The aim of this paper is to study the d-dimensional stochastic heat equation with a multiplicative Gaussian noise which is white in space and it has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter  Hin 0,1 in time. Two types of equations are considered. First we consider the equation in the Ito-Skorohod sense, and later in the Stratonovich sense. An explicit chaos development for the solution is obtained. On the other hand, the moments of the solution are expressed in terms of the exponential moments of some weighted intersection local time of the Brownian motion.","104"
"On-line chain partition is a two-player game between Spoiler and Algorithm. Spoiler presents a partially ordered set, point by point. Algorithm assigns incoming points immediately and irrevocably to the chains which constitute a chain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width w is a minimum number fValw such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most fValw chains on orders of width at most w. We analyze the chain partition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes into play and the value of the game is lfloorfrac1sqrt52; w rfloor.","105"
"Dipper, James and Murphy generalized the classical Specht module theory to Hecke algebras of type B_n. On the other hand, for any choice of a monomial order on the parameters in type B_n, we obtain corresponding Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules. In this paper, we show that the Specht modules are naturally equivalent to the Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules em if we choose the dominance order on the parameters, as in the asymptotic case'' studied by Bonnaf'e and the second named author. We also give examples which show that such an equivalence does not hold for other choices of monomial orders.","114"
"Let M4n be a complete quaternionic K""ahler manifold with scalar curvature bounded below by -16nn2. We get a sharp estimate for the first eigenvalue lambda_1M of the Laplacian which is lambda_1Mle 2n12. If the equality holds, then either M has only one end, or M is diffeomorphic to mathbbRtimes N with N given by a compact manifold. Moreover, if M is of bounded curvature, M is covered by the quaterionic hyperbolic space mathbbQHn and N is a compact quotient of the generalized Heisenberg group. When lambda_1Mge frac8n23, we also prove that M must have only one end with infinite volume.","112"
"Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.","102"
"The longitudinal double spin asymmetry A_1rho for exclusive leptoproduction of rho0 mesons, mu  N - mu  N  rho, is studied using the COMPASS 2002 and 2003 data. The measured reaction is incoherent exclusive rho0 production on polarised deuterons. The Q2 and x dependence of A_1rho is presented in a wide kinematical range: 3x10-3  Q2  7 GeVc2 and 5x10-5  x  0.05. The presented results are the first measurements of A_1rho at small Q2 Q2  0.1 GeVc2 and small x x  3x10-3. The asymmetry is in general compatible with zero in the whole kinematical range.","101"
"Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state is 70 pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of 1,500 photonss per MHz bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and homodyne measurement.","112"
"In this paper, we propose an achievable rate region for discrete memoryless interference channels with conferencing at the transmitter side. We employ superposition block Markov encoding, combined with simultaneous superposition coding, dirty paper coding, and random binning to obtain the achievable rate region. We show that, under respective conditions, the proposed achievable region reduces to Han and Kobayashi achievable region for interference channels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case are given.","100"
"We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by tens of thousands wavelengths.","113"
"We have observed cyclotron resonance in a high-mobility GaAsAlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas by using the techniques of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy combined with magnetic fields. From this, we calculate the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal elements of the magnetoconductivity tensor, which in turn allows us to extract the concentration, effective mass, and scattering time of the electrons in the sample. We demonstrate the utility of ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, which can recover the true linewidth of cyclotron resonance in a high-mobility 106 mathrmcm2 V-1 s-1 sample without being affected by the saturation effect.","101"
"We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries, with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls.","100"
"We study the oxygen doping dependence of the equilibrium first-order melting and second-order glass transitions of vortices in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8delta. Doping affects both anisotropy and disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.","101"
"It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.","105"
"Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance. We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the Fermi velocity.","102"
"The mechanism of the shift, broadening and quenching of the ammonia inversion frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of the wavefunction.","116"
"We compute the complete Fadell-Husseini index of the 8 element dihedral group D_8 acting on Sd times Sd, both for F_2 and for integer coefficients. This establishes the complete goup cohomology lower bounds for the two hyperplane case of Gr""unbaum's 1960 mass partition problem: For which d and j can any j arbitrary measures be cut into four equal parts each by two suitably-chosen hyperplanes in Rd? In both cases, we find that the ideal bounds are not stronger than previously established bounds based on one of the maximal abelian subgroups of D_8.","102"
"Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, and disk. Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with micro-disks.","116"
"The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.","104"
"We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_cH, in the vortex-liquid state, the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.","104"
"We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group NRG method. The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational mode.","120"
"The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.","109"
"The cross section for central diffractive Higgs production is calculated, for the LHC range of energies. The graphs for the possible mechanisms for Higgs production, through pomeron fusion and photon fusions are calculated for all possibilities allowed by the standard model. The cross section for central diffractive Higgs production through pomeron fusion, must be multiplied by a factor for the survival probability, to isolate the Higgs signal and reduce the background. Due to the small value of the survival probability Lb 4 times 10-3Rb , the cross sections for central diffractive Higgs production, in the two cases for pomeron fusion and photon fusion, are competitive.","115"
"We discuss the local and nonlocal dissipation effects on the existence of the global phase coherence transitions in two dimensional Josephson-coupled junctions. The quantum phase transitions are also examined for various lattice geometries: square, triangular and honeycomb. The T0 superconductor-insulator phase transition is analyzed as a function of several control parameters which include self-capacitance and junction capacitance and both local and nonlocal dissipation effects. We found the critical value of the nonlocal dissipation parameter alpha_1 depends on a geometry of the lattice. The critical value of the normal state conductance seems to be difficult to obtain experimentally if we take into consideration different damping mechanisms which are presented in real physical systems.","119"
"We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride h-BN substrate using ab initio density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.","120"
"After negative temperature is restated, we find that it will derive necessarily decrease of entropy. Negative temperature is based on the Kelvin scale and the condition dU0 and dS0. Conversely, there is also negative temperature for dU0 and dS0. But, negative temperature is contradiction with usual meaning of temperature and with some basic concepts of physics and mathematics. It is a question in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We proposed a possibility of decrease of entropy due to fluctuation magnified and internal interactions in some isolated systems. From this we discuss some possible examples and theories.","103"
"We describe a search for the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of 105 GeVc2 to 145 GeVc2 in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 450 pb-1 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The Higgs boson is required to be produced in association with a Z boson, and the Z boson is required to decay to either electrons or muons with the Higgs boson decaying to a bbbar pair. The data are well described by the expected background, leading to 95 confidence level cross section upper limits sigmappbarto ZHx BHtobbbar in the range of 3.1 pb to 4.4 pb.","119"
"Let R, mathfrak m denote an n-dimensional Gorenstein ring. For an ideal I subset R of height c we are interested in the endomorphism ring B  Hom_RHc_IR, Hc_IR. It turns out that B is a commutative ring. In the case of R,mathfrak m a regular local ring containing a field B is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Its properties are related to the highest Lyubeznik number l  dim_k Ext_Rdk,Hc_IR. In particular R simeq B if and only if l  1. Moreover, we show that the natural homomorphism Ext_Rdk, Hc_IR to k is non-zero.","106"
"The analysis of databases of photographic images of the Sun obtained in region of soft x-ray by means of a method of multilevel dynamical contrasting, has shown presence of skeletal structures of the Sun as outside chromo-sphere flashes and powerful coronal mass ejections and on the Sun structures in its atmosphere, protuberances and of solar a stains. Moreover the structures which radius of rotation is less than radius of a solar disk on breadth of their observation have been revealed. On the basis of the obtained results of this analysis, the author puts forward a hypothesis about an opportunity of existence of some filamentary matter as inside, so outside of the Sun.","119"
"We investigate possible mass shift and width broadening of Jpsi in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rule. Input values of gluon condensates at finite temperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and pressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to TTc  1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results in change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the phenomenological side, we find that mass shift of Jpsi just above Tc can reach maximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.","106"
"The Large Hadron Collider, a 7  7 TeV proton-proton collider under construction at CERN the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, will take experiments squarely into a new energy domain where mysteries of the electroweak interaction will be unveiled. What marks the 1-TeV scale as an important target? Why is understanding how the electroweak symmetry is hidden important to our conception of the world around us? What expectations do we have for the agent that hides the electroweak symmetry? Why do particle physicists anticipate a great harvest of discoveries within reach of the LHC?","102"
"We provide the explicit combinatorial structure of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals Br,s of type D_n1, B_n1, and A_2n-12. This is achieved by constructing the crystal analogue sigma of the automorphism of the D_n1 resp. B_n1 or A_2n-12 Dynkin diagram that interchanges the 0 and 1 node. The involution sigma is defined in terms of new plus-minus diagrams that govern the D_n to D_n-1 resp. B_n to B_n-1, or C_n to C_n-1 branching. It is also shown that the crystal Br,s is perfect. These crystals have been implemented in MuPAD-Combinat; the implementation is discussed in terms of many examples.","112"
"The past decade has seen a flurry of research into pattern avoiding permutations but little of it is concerned with their exhaustive generation. Many applications call for exhaustive generation of permutations subject to various constraints or imposing a particular generating order. In this paper we present generating algorithms and combinatorial Gray codes for several families of pattern avoiding permutations. Among the families under consideration are those counted by Catalan, Schr""oder, Pell, even index Fibonacci numbers and the central binomial coefficients. Consequently, this provides Gray codes for s_ntau for all tauin s_3 and the obtained Gray codes have distances 4 and 5.","112"
"Starting from the governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma including the quantum Bohm potential and electron spin-12 effects, we show that the system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic QMHD equations admit rarefactive solitons due to the balance between nonlinearities and quantum diffractiontunneling effects. It is found that the electron spin-12 effect introduces a pressure-like term with negative sign in the QMHD equations, which modifies the shape of the solitary magnetosonic waves and makes them wider and shallower. Numerical simulations of the time-dependent system shows the development of rarefactive QMHD solitary waves that are modified by the spin effects.","101"
"It was recently noted that the dispersion relation for the magnons of planar N4 SYM can be identified with the Casimir of a certain deformation of the Poincare algebra, in which the energy and momentum operators are supplemented by a boost generator J. By considering the relationship between J and su22 x R2, we derive a q-deformed super-Poincare symmetry algebra of the kinematics. Using this, we show that the dynamic magnon representations may be obtained by boosting from a fixed rest-frame representation. We comment on aspects of the coalgebra structure and some implications for the question of boost-covariance of the S-matrix.","108"
"We consider quantum field theory in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, with the position coordinates represented by twistors instead of the usual world-vectors. Upon imposing canonical commutation relations between twistors and dual twistors, quantum theory of fields described by non-holomorphic functions of twistor variables becomes manifestly non-commutative, with Lorentz symmetry broken by a time-like vector. We discuss the free field propagation and its impact on the short- and long-distance behavior of physical amplitudes in perturbation theory. In the ultraviolet limit, quantum field theories in twistor space are generically less divergent than their commutative counterparts. Furthermore, there is no infrared--ultraviolet mixing problem.","111"
"We measure the absolute branching fraction for D0 -- K- pi using partial reconstruction of B0bar -- D X ell- barnu_ell decays, in which only the charged lepton and the pion from the decay D -- D0 pi are used. Based on a data sample of 230 million B Bbar pairs collected at the Upsilon4S resonance with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy B Factory at SLAC, we obtain the absolute branching fractions of D0 -- K- pi  4.007 pm 0.037 pm 0.072, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.","100"
"This paper is devoted to discuss the energy-momentum for static axially symmetric spacetimes in the framework of teleparallel theory of gravity. For this purpose, we use the teleparallel versions of Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann and Mddotoller prescriptions. A comparison of the results shows that the energy density is different but the momentum turns out to be constant in each prescription. This is exactly similar to the results available in literature using the framework of General Relativity. It is mentioned here that Mddotoller energy-momentum distribution is independent of the coupling constant lambda. Finally, we calculate energy-momentum distribution for the Curzon metric, a special case of the above mentioned spacetime.","118"
"The parametric dependence of a quantum map under the influence of a rank-1 perturbation is investigated. While the Floquet operator of the map and its spectrum have a common period with respect to the perturbation strength lambda, we show an example in which none of the quasienergies nor the eigenvectors obey the same period: After a periodic increment of lambda, the quasienergy arrives at the nearest higher one, instead of the initial one, exhibiting an anholonomy, which governs another anholonomy of the eigenvectors. An application to quantum state manipulations is outlined.","100"
"Coupled-mode systems are used in physical literature to simplify the nonlinear Maxwell and Gross-Pitaevskii equations with a small periodic potential and to approximate localized solutions called gap solitons by analytical expressions involving hyperbolic functions. We justify the use of the one-dimensional stationary coupled-mode system for a relevant elliptic problem by employing the method of Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions in Fourier space. In particular, existence of periodicanti-periodic and decaying solutions is proved and the error terms are controlled in suitable norms. The use of multi-dimensional stationary coupled-mode systems is justified for analysis of bifurcations of periodicanti-periodic solutions in a small multi-dimensional periodic potential.","107"
"Let H be a connected reductive subgroup of a complex connected reductive group G. Fix maximal tori and Borel subgroups of H and G. Consider the pairs V,V' of irreducible representations of H and G such that V is a submodule of V'. We are interested in the cone LRG,H generated by the pairs of dominant weights of such a pair of representations. Our main result gives a minimal set of inequalities describing LRG,H as a part of the dominant chamber. In way, we obtain results about the faces of the Dolgachev-Hu's G-ample cone and variations of this cone.","113"
"A long duration photon beam can induce macroscopic coherent effects on a plasma by single photon electron scattering if the probability of the interaction approaches 1 in a volume of unit surface and length equal to the plasma typical wavelength, and the induced electron oscillations become relativistic in few plasma cycles. A fraction of the plasma electrons is accelerated through the Wakefield mechanism by the cavities created by the photon-electron interactions and radiates through boosted betraton emission in the same cavities. The resulting emission in this framework is very similar to the typical GRB radiation. Several comparisons with GRB light curves and spectral-energy correlations will be presented.","112"
"A quantitative theory of the buckling of a worm like chain based on a semi-classical approximation of the partition function is presented. The contribution of thermal fluctuations to the force-extension relation that allows to go beyond the classical Euler buckling is derived in the linear and non-linear regime as well. It is shown that the thermal fluctuations in the nonlinear buckling regime increase the end-to-end distance of the semiflexible rod if it is confined to 2 dimensions as opposed to the 3 dimensional case. Our approach allows a complete physical understanding of buckling in D2 and in D3 below and above the Euler transition.","108"
"We observe large-amplitude Rabi oscillations between an atomic and a molecular state near a Feshbach resonance. The experiment uses 87Rb in an optical lattice and a Feshbach resonance near 414 G. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations depend on magnetic field in a way that is well described by a two-level model. The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.","110"
"We study analytical properties of the hard exclusive processes amplitudes. We found that QCD factorization for deeply virtual Compton scattering and hard exclusive vector meson production results in the subtracted dispersion relation with the subtraction constant determined by the Polyakov-Weiss D-term. The relation of this constant to the fixed pole contribution found by Brodsky, Close and Gunion and defined by parton distributions is proved, while its manifestation is spoiled by the small x divergence. The continuation to the real photons limit is considered and the numerical correspondence between lattice simulations of D-term and low energy Thomson amplitude is found.","105"
"The principal limits for the accuracy of the resonance frequency measurements set by the asymmetry of the natural resonance line shape are studied and applied to the recent accurate frequency measurements in the two-photon 1s-2s resonance and in the one-photon 1s-2p resonance in hydrogen atom. This limit for 1s-2s resonance is found to be sim 10-5 Hz compared to the accuracy achieved in experiment pm 46 Hz. In case of deuterium atom the limit is essentially larger: 10-2 Hz. For 1s-2p resonance the accuracy limit is 0.17 MHz while the uncertainty of the recent frequency measurement is about 6 MHz.","105"

An explicitly correlated ansatz for the leptonic wave function is employed describing accurately the motion of the leptons two electrons and positron in the field of the helium nucleus and of the antiproton with arbitrary orbital angular momentum projection Lambda onto the internuclear axis. Results for Lambda0, 1 and 30 are presented. For quasibound states with large values of Lambda and rotational quantum numbers JLambda no annihilation and rearrangement decay channels occur, i. e. they are metastable.","101"
"TiO_2-delta films were deposited on 100 Lanthanum aluminates LaAlO_3 substrates at a very low oxygen chamber pressure Papprox 0.3 mtorr employing a pulsed laser ablation deposition technique. In previous work, it was established that the oxygen deficiency in these films induced ferromagnetism. In this work it is demonstrated that this same oxygen deficiency also gives rise to semiconductor titanium ion impurity donor energy levels. Transport resistivity measurements in thin films of TiO_2-delta are presented as a function of temperature and magnetic field. Magneto- and Hall- resistivity is explained in terms of electronic excitations from the titanium ion donor levels into the conduction band.","109"

"We present the results of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for 18 elements in 31 nearby stars with planets. The resulting abundances are combined with other similar studies of nearby stars with planets and compared to a sample of nearby stars without detected planets.

We encourage continued study of the abundance patterns of stars with planets to resolve these discrepancies.","100"
"The core of the vortex in the Neel order parameter for an easy-plane antiferromagnet on honeycomb lattice is demonstrated to bind two zero-energy states. Remarkably, a single electron occupying this mid-gap band has its spin fragmented between the two sublattices: Whereas it yields a vanishing total magnetization it shows a finite Neel order, orthogonal to the one of the assumed background. The requisite easy-plane anisotropy may be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer, for example. The results are relevant for spin-12 fermions on graphene's or optical honeycomb lattice, in the strongly interacting regime.","107"
"The problem of characterizing complexity of quantum dynamics - in particular of locally interacting chains of quantum particles - will be reviewed and discussed from several different perspectives: i stability of motion against external perturbations and decoherence, ii efficiency of quantum simulation in terms of classical computation and entanglement production in operator spaces, iii quantum transport, relaxation to equilibrium and quantum mixing, and iv computation of quantum dynamical entropies. Discussions of all these criteria will be confronted with the established criteria of integrability or quantum chaos, and sometimes quite surprising conclusions are found. Some conjectures and interesting open problems in ergodic theory of the quantum many problem are suggested.","118"
"We investigate the competition between pairing correlations and ferromagnetism in small metallic grains in the presence of a Zeeman field. Our analysis is based on the universal Hamiltonian, valid in the limit of large Thouless conductance. We show that the coexistence regime of superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations can be made experimentally accessible by tuning an external Zeeman field. We compare the exact solution of the model with a mean-field theory and find that the latter cannot describe pairing correlations in the intermediate regime. We also study the occurrence of spin jumps across the phase boundary separating the superconducting and coexistence regimes.","108"
"The temperature dependence of the reflectance spectra of magnesium oxide MgO and ferropericlase Mg1-xFexO, for x0.06 and x0.27 have been measured over a wide frequency range 50 to 32000 cm-1 at 295 and 6 K. The complex dielectric function has been determined from a Kramers-Kronig analysis of the reflectance. The spectra of the doped materials resembles pure MgO in the infrared region, but with much broader resonances. We use a shell model to calculate the dielectric function of ferropericlase, including both anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions and disorder scattering. These data are relevant to understanding the heat conductivity of ferropericlase in the earth's lower mantle.","111"
"OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of remnant-cloud interaction. We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 60356030 MHz OH masers towards 36 supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.","117"
"Feedback from black hole activity is widely believed to play a key role in regulating star formation and black hole growth. A long-standing issue is the relation between the star formation and fueling the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei AGNs. We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation rates in circumnuclear regions CNRs. Comparing with the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt K-S law, we find that the star formation rates in CNRs of most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to explain the suppressed star formation rates.","111"
"We show that the transverse double spin asymmetry DSA in the Drell-Yan process contributed only from the Sivers functions can be picked out by the weighting function fracQ_TM2cosphi-phi_S_1cosphi-phi_S_23sinphi-phi_S_1sinphi-phi_S_2. The asymmetry is proportional to the product of two Sivers functions from each hadron f_1Tperp1times f_1Tperp 1. Using two sets of Sivers functions extracted from the semi-inclusive deeply elastic scattering data at HERMES, we estimate this asymmetry in the puparrowbarpuparrow Drell-Yan process which is possible to be performed in HESR at GSI. The prediction of DSA in the Drell-Yan process contributed by the function g_1Tx,Vec k_T2, which can be extracted by the weighting function fracQ_TM23cosphi-phi_S_1cosphi-phi_S_2sinphi-phi_S_1sinphi-phi_S_2, is also given at GSI.","117"
"Using three-dimensional k.p calculation including strain and piezoelectricity, we showed that the size of the quantum dot QD in the growth direction determines the influence of the In,GaAs capping layer on the optical properties of 11k grown InAs QDs, where k1,2,3. For flat dots, increase of In concentration in the capping layer leads to a decrease of the transition energy, as is the case of 001 grown QDs, whereas for large dots an increase of the In concentration in the capping layer is followed by an increase of the transition energy up to a critical concentration of In, after which the optical transition energy starts to decrease.","117"
"Casimir effect of a topologically nontrivial two-dimensional space-time, through Krein space quantization 1,2, has been calculated. In other words, auxiliary negative norm states have been utilized here. Presence of negative norm states play the role of an automatic renormalization device for the theory. The negative norm states which do not interact with the physical world could be chosen in two perspective. In the first case our method results in zero or vanishing values for energy. In the second case, however, the result are the same as the renormalization procedure.","100"
"The effective gluon propagator constructed with the pinch technique is governed by a Schwinger-Dyson equation with special structure and gauge properties, that can be deduced from the correspondence with the background field method. Most importantly the non-perturbative gluon self-energy is transverse order-by-order in the dressed loop expansion, and separately for gluonic and ghost contributions, a property which allows for a meanigfull truncation. A linearized version of the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equation is derived, using a vertex that satisfies the required Ward identity and contains massless poles. The resulting integral equation, subject to a properly regularized constraint, is solved numerically, and the main features of the solutions are briefly discussed.","119"
"A SU4 flavor symmetrical Lagrangian is constructed for the interaction of the pseudo-scalar mesons with the vector mesons. SU4 symmetry is broken to SU3 by suppression of terms in the Lagrangian where the interaction should be driven by charmed mesons. Chiral symmetry can be restored by setting this new SU4 symmetry breaking parameters to zero. Unitarization in coupled channels leads to the dynamical generation of resonances. Many known axial resonances can be identified including the new controversial X3872 and the structure found recently by Belle around 3875 MeV in the hidden charm sector. Also new resonances are predicted, some of them with exotic quantum numbers.","112"
"The cross-couplings among several massless spin-two fields described in the free limit by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions in the presence of a Dirac field are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, background Lorentz invariance and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different gravitons in the presence of a Dirac field. The basic features of the couplings between a single Pauli-Fierz field and a Dirac field are also emphasized.","111"

"A ToO observation of the TeV-emitting blazar Mrk 421 with INTEGRAL was triggered in June 2006 by an increase of the RXTE count rate to more than 30 mCrab. The source was then observed with all INTEGRAL instruments with the exception of the spectrometer SPI for a total exposure of 829 ks. During this time several outbursts were observed by IBIS and JEM-X. Multiwavelength observations were immediately triggered and the source was observed at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths up to TeV energies. The data obtained during these observations are analysed with respect to spectral evolution and correlated variability. Preliminary results of the analysis are presented in this poster.","116"
"We show in spatially one dimensional Madelung fluid that a simple requirement on local stability of the maximum of quantum probability density will, if combined with the global scale invariance of quantum potential, lead to a class of quantum probability densities globally being self-trapped by their own self-generated quantum potentials, possessing only a finite-size spatial support. It turns out to belong to a class of the most probable wave function given its energy through the maximum entropy principle. We proceed to show that there is a limiting case in which the quantum probability density becomes the stationary-moving soliton-like solution of the Schr""odinger equation.","111"
"Heavy-ion reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei provide a unique means to investigate the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. In particular, recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion reactions have already put a stringent constraint on the nuclear symmetry energy around the nuclear matter saturation density. We review this exciting result and discuss its implications on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. In addition, we also review the theoretical progress on probing the high density behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy-ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams.","114"

The number of non zero entries in the considered matrices ranges from 8 to 37 millions. The largest rank computation took more than 35 days on 50 processors. We report on the actual algorithms we used to build the matrices, their link to the motivic cohomology and the linear algebra and parallelizations required to perform such huge computations. In particular, these results are part of the first computation of the cohomology of the linear group GL_7Z.","108"
"We study the competition between antiferromagnetic order and valence bond solid formation in a two-dimensional frustrated spin-12 model. The J1-J2 model on the square lattice is further frustrated by introducing products of three-spin projectors which stabilize four dimer-product states as degenerate ground states. These four states are reminiscent of the dimerized singlet ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland model. Using exact diagonalizations, we study the evolution of the ground state by varying theratio of interactions. For a large range of parameters J2  0.25J1, our model shows a direct transition between the valence-bond-solid phase and the collinear antiferromagnetic phase. For small values of J2, several intermediate phases appear which are also analyzed.","119"

Finally, we exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3.","101"
"In this work, we consider several types of lubricants - including non-Newtonian fluids - that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters. The experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical EHL relationships and by more recently developed models. This broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness hm showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models. Commonly used elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication EHL models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation, whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes.","120"
"The aim of this article is to study a nonlinear system modeling a Non-Newtonian fluid of polymer aqueous solutions. We are interested here in the existence of weak solutions for the stationary problem in a bounded plane domain or in two-dimensional exterior domain. Due to the third order of derivatives in the non-linear term, it's difficult to obtain solution satisfying energy inequality. But with a good choice of boundary conditions, an adapt special basis and the use of the good properties of the trilinear form associated to the non-linear term, we obtain energy solutions. The problem in bounded domain is treated and the more difficult problem on non bounded domain too.","120"
"We consider the lightest scalar meson in the frame of the SU_L2times SU_R2 linear sigma model, keeping in mind that this model could be the low energy realization of the two-flavour QCD. We show that the sigma field is described by its four-quark component at least in the sigma resonance energy virtuality region and the sigmatogammagamma decay is the four quark transition. We emphasize that residues of the sigma pole in the pipitopipi and gammagammatopipi amplitudes do not give an idea about the sigma meson nature, and the progress in studying the sigma meson production mechanisms in different processes could essentially further us in understanding its nature.","112"
"A spectroscopic method for staggered fermions based on thermodynamical considerations is proposed. The canonical partition functions corresponding to the different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit as polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the zero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is successfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched results are presented showing good agreement with that of standard spectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon and dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations are practically unreachable.","109"

Motivated by interest in the worldsheet S-matrix of string theory in AdS_5 x S5 in the limit of infinite worldsheet volume we consider the semiclassical quantization of a particular soliton of this theory: the Hofman-Maldacena giant magnon' spinning string. We obtain explicit formulas for the complete spectrum of bosonic and fermionic fluctuations around the giant magnon. As an application of these results we confirm that the one-loop correction to the classical energy vanishes as expected.","100"

Each system can be obtained by connecting some invariant divisors in the system of type D_41. Each system admits affine Weyl group symmetry of types B_31,G_21,D_32 and A_22, respectively. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new.","101"

We investigate the relaxation of the material towards a stationary flow and analyze the stress and the velocity fields. We provide the functional form of the widening of the shear zone inside the bulk. We discuss the growth of the region where the material is in critical state. It is found that the growth of the critical zone is responsible for the initial transient of the shear zone.","119"

The differential cross section is expressed by a small number of Master Integrals with exact dependence on the fermion masses me, mf and the Mandelstam invariants s,t,u. We determine the limit of fixed scattering angle and high energy, assuming the hierarchy of scales me2  mf2  s,t,u. The numerical result is combined with the available non-fermionic contributions. As a by-product, we provide an independent check of the known electron-loop contributions.","103"
"The viscosity is measured for a Fermi liquid, a dilute 3He-4He mixture, under extremely high magnetic fieldtemperature conditions B leq 14.8 T, T geq 1.5 mK. The spin splitting energy mu B is substantially greater than the Fermi energy k_B T_F; as a consequence the polarization tends to unity and s-wave quasiparticle scattering is suppressed for T ll T_F. Using a novel composite vibrating-wire viscometer an enhancement of the viscosity is observed by a factor of more than 500 over its low-field value. Good agreement is found between the measured viscosity and theoretical predictions based upon a t-matrix formalism.","107"
"The Mathematica toolkit AMBRE derives Mellin-Barnes MB representations for Feynman integrals in d4-2eps dimensions. It may be applied for tadpoles as well as for multi-leg multi-loop scalar and tensor integrals. AMBRE uses a loop-by-loop approach and aims at lowest dimensions of the final MB representations. The present version of AMBRE works fine for planar Feynman diagrams. The output may be further processed by the package MB for the determination of its singularity structure in eps. The AMBRE package contains various sample applications for Feynman integrals with up to six external particles and up to four loops.","102"
"Considering a separable and purely kinetic 5D scalar field on a warped product metric background we propose a new and more general approach for inducing 4D scalar potentials on a 4D constant foliation of the 5D space-time. We obtain an induced potential for a true 4D scalar field instead of a potential for an effective 4D scalar field. In this formalism we can recover the usual 4D inflationary formalism with a geometrically induced inflationary potential. In addition the quantum confinement of the inflaton modes is obtained naturally from the model for at least a class of warping factors. Besides the 4D inflationary physics that results of this formalism is independent of the 4D-hypersurface chosen.","119"
"Solid state lasers are demanding independent control in the gain media and cavity loss to achieve ultra short laser pulses using passive mode-locking. Recently, laser mode-locking is achieved with a MBE structure with multiple quantum wells, designed to achieve two functions; Bragg mirror and changes in absorption to control the cavity dynamics. The use of an AlGaAsAlAs Bragg mirror with a 15 nm GaAs saturable absorber used in a Cr:LiSAF tuneable laser proved to be effective to produce femtosecond pulses. The use of saturable absorbers thus far is a trial and error procedure that is changing due to the correlation with more predictive procedures.","113"
"The classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian was solved for oriented spinel thin and thick cubic ferrites. The dipole matrix of complicated cubic cell could be simplified into the form of dipole Matrix of simple cubic cells. This study was confined only to the highly oriented thin films of ferrite. The variation of total energy of Nickel ferrite thin films with angle and number of layers was investigated. Also the change of energy with stress induced anisotropy for Nickel ferrite films with N5 and 1000 has been studied. Films with the magnetic moments ratio 1.86 can be easily oriented in 90 direction when N is greater than 400.","111"
"We study Markov processes associated with stochastic differential equations, whose non-linearities are gradients of convex functionals. We prove a general result of existence of such Markov processes and a priori estimates on the transition probabilities. The main result is the following stability property: if the associated invariant measures converge weakly, then the Markov processes converge in law. The proofs are based on the interpretation of a Fokker-Planck equation as the steepest descent flow of the relative Entropy functional in the space of probability measures, endowed with the Wasserstein distance. Applications include stochastic partial differential equations and convergence of equilibrium fluctuations for a class of random interfaces.","115"
"Using a semi-classical approach, we describe an on-chip cooling protocol for a micro-mechanical resonator by employing a superconducting flux qubit. A Lorentz force, generated by the passive back-action of the resonator's displacement, can cool down the thermal motion of the mechanical resonator by applying an appropriate microwave drive to the qubit. We show that this onchip cooling protocol, with well-controlled cooling power and a tunable response time of passive back-action, can be highly efficient. With feasible experimental parameters, the effective mode temperature of a resonator could be cooled down by several orders of magnitude.","105"
"We consider the Bose-Hubbard model in a two dimensional rotating optical lattice and investigate the consequences of the effective magnetic field created by rotation. Using a Gutzwiller type variational wavefunction, we find an analytical expression for the Mott insulatorMI-SuperfluidSF transition boundary in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of the Hofstadter butterfly. The dependence of phase boundary on the effective magnetic field is complex, reflecting the self-similar properties of the single particle energy spectrum. Finally, we argue that fractional quantum Hall phases exist close to the MI-SF transition boundaries, including MI states with particle densities greater than one.","105"
"We study the behaviour of the C60 molecule under very high internal or external pressure using Tersoff as well as Brenner potentials. As a result, we estimate the critical internal and external pressures that lead to its instability. We also calculate stretching force constant and bulk modulus of this molecule at several pressures under which the molecule remains stable. The values of these estimated here at zero pressure agree closely with those obtained in earlier calculations. We also observe that at high pressures, a finite value of parameter of Tersoff potential gives physically acceptable results in contrast to its value zero, which is usually taken for the carbon systems.","117"
"We study the energy deposition by light and heavy nuclei in tissue-like media as used for cancer therapy. The depth-dose distributions for protons, 3He, 12C, 20Ne, and 58Ni nuclei are calculated within a Monte Carlo model based on the GEANT4 toolkit. These distributions are compared with each other and with available experimental data. It is demonstrated that nuclear fragmentation reactions essentially reduce the peak-to-plateau ratio of the dose profiles for deeply penetrating energetic ions heavier than 3He. On the other hand, all projectiles up to 20Ne were found equally suitable for therapeutic use at low penetration depths.","107"
"We have investigated the dimensionality and origin of the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3 films epitaxially grown on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3001 substrates. High mobility conduction is observed at low deposition oxygen pressures PO2  10-5 mbar and has a three-dimensional character. However, at higher PO2 the conduction is dramatically suppressed and nonmetallic behavior appears. Experimental data strongly support an interpretation of these properties based on the creation of oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3 substrates during the growth of the LaAlO3 layer. When grown on SrTiO3 substrates at low PO2, other oxides generate the same high mobility as LaAlO3 films. This opens interesting prospects for all-oxide electronics.","111"
"Masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, which are ground states of light orand heavy quarks and antiquarks, have been calculated in the framework of an extended model of quasi-independent quarks with absolute uncertainties about 30 MeV. It is shown that the assumption on equidistant discrete levels for a mean field energy does not contradict to existing data and permits to reduce a number of model parameters. It is obtained, that a difference between neighbouring mean field energy levels is flavour independent. Values of spin-spin interaction between quarks and antiquarks with different flavours in pseudoscalar and vector mesons are presented.","106"
"The idea that substantial absorption in AGN could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of QSO evolution was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of X-ray absorbed AGN at z1 to z3, that have shown strong emission at 850 mkm. This strong emission is a signature of the copious star formation. In AGN evolution model, the main obscured growth phase of the QSO coincides with formation of the host galaxy spheroid, the completion of which indicates the beginning of the luminous, unobscured phase of the QSO's evolution. The verification of this model at redshifts up to z6 appears possible via application of the gamma-ray resonant absorption method.","118"
"We report on the observation of enhanced microwave transmission through quasi-periodic hole arrays in metal films. The fraction of transmitted light reaches 50 in a self-standing metal film and approaches 90 when the film is sandwiched between thin dielectric slabs, while the holes occupy only 10 of the sample area. The maximum transmission is accompanied by zero phase change, rendering the film almost 'invisible' over a wide frequency range. The extraordinary transmission phenomenon is interpreted in terms of resonances in the self-consistent interaction between holes, which are represented by effective electric and magnetic dipoles.","102"
"Starting with an adjoint pair of operators, under suitable abstract versions of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl M-function of extensions of the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions and we establish results on the relationship between the M-function as an analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We also give an example where the M-function does not contain the whole spectral information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to elliptic PDEs where the M-function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.","102"
"Phenomenology of the notion of an unparticle U, recently perceived by Georgi, to describe a scale invariant sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point at a higher energy scale is explored in details. Behaving like a collection of d_U the scale dimension of the unparticle operator O_U invisible massless particles, this unparticle can be unveiled by measurements of various energy distributions for the processes Z to fermion pair  U and e-e to gamma U at e-e colliders, as well as mono-jet production at hadron colliders. We also study the propagator effects of the unparticle through the Drell-Yan tree level process and the one-loop muon anomaly.","112"
"We analyze theoretically adiabatic quantum pumping through a normal conductor that couples the normal regions of two superconductornormal metalsuperconductor Josephson junctions. By using the phases of the superconducting order parameter in the superconducting contacts as pumping parameters, we demonstrate that a non zero pumped charge can flow through the device. The device exploits the evolution of the superconducting phases due to the ac Josephson effect, and can therefore be operated at very high frequency, resulting in a pumped current as large as a few nanoAmperes. The experimental relevance of our calculations is discussed.","100"
"We calculate the inclusive decay rate of the spin-triplet bottomonium states chi_bJ into charm hadrons, including the leading-order color-singlet and color-octet bb-bar annihilation mechanisms. We also calculate the momentum distribution of the charm quark from the decay of chi_bJ. The infrared divergences from the color-singlet process bb-bar - cc-bar g are factored into the probability density at the origin for a bb-bar pair in a color-octet state. That probability density can be determined phenomenologically from the fraction of decays of chi_bJ that include charm hadrons. It can then be used to predict the partial widths into light hadrons for all four states in the P-wave bottomonium multiplet.","113"
"Continuous-time quantum walk CTQW on a given graph is investigated by using the techniques of the spectral analysis and inverse Laplace transform of the Stieltjes function Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution associated with the graph. It is shown that, the probability amplitude of observing the CTQW at a given site at time t is related to the inverse Laplace transformation of the Stieltjes function, namely, one can calculate the probability amplitudes only by taking the inverse laplace transform of the function iG_muis, where G_mux is the Stieltjes function of the graph. The preference of this procedure is that, there is no any need to know the spectrum of the graph","118"
"Point defect migration is considered as a mechanism for aging in ferroelectrics. Numerical results are given for the coupled problems of point defect migration and electrostatic energy relaxation in a 2D domain configuration. The peak values of the clamping pressure at domain walls are in the range of 106 Pa, which corresponds to macroscopically observed coercive stresses in perovskite ferroelectrics. The effect is compared to mechanisms involving orientational reordering of defect dipoles in the bulk of domains. Domain clamping is significantly stronger in the drift mechanism than in the orientational picture for the same material parameters.","102"
"The dual observation of the Omega production in central AuAu collisions having both an exponential p_T distribution and also associated particles above the background has been referred to as the Omega puzzle. We give a quantitative description of how that puzzle can be understood in terms of phantom jets, where only ridges without peaks are produced to give rise to both the Omega trigger and its associated particles. In the framework of recombination of thermal partons we are able to reproduce both the Deltaphi distribution and the trigger-momentum dependence of the yield of the associated particles. We make predictions on other observables that can be checked by further analyses of the data.","117"
"We demonstrate that the strong anomalies in the high frequency LO-phonon spectrum in cuprate superconductors can in principle be explained by the enhanced electronic polarizability associated with the self-organized one dimensionality of metallic stripes. Contrary to the current interpretation in terms of transversal stripe fluctuations, the anomaly should occur at momenta parallel to the stripes. The doping dependence of the anomaly is naturally explained, and we predict that the phonon line-width and the spread of the anomaly in the transverse momentum decrease with increasing temperature while high resolution measurements should reveal a characteristic substructure to the anomaly.","102"
"Average transverse momentum of hadrons produced in high energy collisions is proposed as a diagnostic probe of high density saturation physics. We show that by introducing and varying a transverse momentum cutoff in the definition of the average transverse momentum, one can eliminate the uncertainty in the overall magnitude of the leading order hadron production cross section in high energy collisions, and semi-quantitatively map the different dynamical regions predicted by the saturation physics. We discuss the applications of this method to pion production at RHIC and LHC and make quantitative predictions for the average transverse momentum of produced pions in the kinematics appropriate for the RHIC and LHC experiments.","114"
"We perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the TIP5P model to quantify structural order in both the first shell defined by four nearest neighborsand second shell defined by twelve next-nearest neighbors of a central water molecule. We find the anomalous decrease of orientational order upon compression occurs in both shells, but the anomalous decrease of translational order upon compression occurs it mainly in the second shell. The decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression ""structural anomaly"" are thus correlated only in the second shell. Our findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second shell upon compression.","120"
"Improved actions in SU2 and SU3 lattice gauge theories are investigated with an emphasis on asymptotic scaling. A new scheme for tadpole improvement is proposed. The standard but heuristic tadpole improvement emerges from a mean field approximation from the new approach. Scaling is investigated by means of the large distance static quark potential. Both, the generic and the new tadpole scheme yield significant improvements on asymptotic scaling when compared with loop improved actions. A study of the rotational symmetry breaking terms, however, reveals that only the new improvement scheme efficiently eliminates the leading irrelevant term from the action.","107"
"Infrared-Faint Radio Sources represent a new and unexpected class of object which is bright at radio wavelengths but unusually faint at infrared wavelengths. If, like most mJy radio sources, they were either conventional active or star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, we would expect them to be detectable at infrared wavelengths, and so their non-detection by the Spitzer Space Telescope is surprising. Here we report the detection of one of these sources using Very Long Baseline Interferometry, from which we conclude that the sources are driven by Active Galactic Nuclei. We suggest that these sources are either normal radio-loud quasars at high redshift or abnormally obscured radio galaxies.","117"
"An interval coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring of EG by positive integers such that the colors on the edges incident to any vertex are consecutive. A 3,4-biregular bigraph is a bipartite graph in which each vertex of one part has degree 3 and each vertex of the other has degree 4; it is unknown whether these all have interval colorings. We prove that G has an interval coloring using 6 colors when G is a 3,4-biregular bigraph having a spanning subgraph whose components are paths with endpoints at 3-valent vertices and lengths in 2,4,6,8. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a subgraph.","114"

We measure BrbarB0 - Ds Lambda barp  2.9 pm 0.7pm 0.5 pm 0.4 10-5, where the first error is statistical, the second is systematic and the third error comes from the uncertainty in BrDs - phi pi. The data used for this analysis was accumulated at the Upsilon4S resonance, using the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy ee- collider. The integrated luminosity of the data sample is 414 fb-1, corresponding to 449106 Bbar B pairs.","103"
"Consistent interactions that can be added to a free, Abelian gauge theory comprising a collection of BF models and a set of three-form gauge fields are constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based on specific cohomological techniques. Under the hypotheses of smooth, local, PT invariant, Lorentz covariant, and Poincare invariant interactions, supplemented with the requirement on the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field with respect to the free theory, we obtain that the deformation procedure modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations as well as the accompanying algebra.","106"
"The full three dimensional dispersion of the pi-bands, Fermi velocities and effective masses are measured with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and compared to first-principles calculations. The band structure by density-functional theory strongly underestimates the slope of the bands and the trigonal warping effect. Including electron-electron calculation on the level of the GW approximation, however, yields remarkable agreement in the vicinity of the Fermi level. This demonstrates the breakdown of the independent electron picture in semi-metallic graphite and points towards a pronounced role of electron correlation for the interpretation of transport experiments and double-resonant Raman scattering for a wide range of carbon based materials.","110"
"We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.","111"
"The growth of atomically-flat thin films of ferroelectric PbTiO3 on SrTiO3 substrates, using molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. The main issue in the growth of these materials is the high volatility of lead. This can be largely overcome by using PbO, instead of Pb, as a source and by using atomic oxygen during growth. The continuous decrease of the out-of-plane lattice parameter with increasing temperature in the investigated range, indicates that PbTiO3 is still ferroelectric at the growth temperature Tg 600oC, which agrees with the theoretical prediction of TC 765oC compared to TCbulk 490oC for the present mismatch strain values.","110"
"GREGOR is a new open solar telescope with an aperture of 1.5m. It replaces the former 45-cm Gregory Coude telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The optical concept is that of a double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical mirrors are made from a silicon-carbide material with high thermal conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the near infrared and a 2-dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Perot interferometers for the visible.","119"
"We provide a general classification of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories that can be obtained from orbifolding of theories with four and eight supercharges. We impose at least one preserved supercharge on the lattice and Lorentz invariance in the naive continuum limit. Starting with four supercharges, we obtain one two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, identical to the one already given in the literature. Starting with eight supercharges, we obtain a unique three-dimensional lattice gauge theory and infinitely many two-dimensional lattice theories. They can be classified according to seven distinct groups, five of which have two preserved supercharges while the others have only one.","110"
"We perform a quantitative analysis of extensive chess databases and show that the frequencies of opening moves are distributed according to a power-law with an exponent that increases linearly with the game depth, whereas the pooled distribution of all opening weights follows Zipf's law with universal exponent. We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism. Our findings are of relevance in general processes with composite decisions.","116"
"We study gravitational radiation reaction in the equations of motion for binary systems with spin-orbit coupling, at order vc7 beyond Newtonian gravity, or Ovc2 beyond the leading radiation reaction effects for non-spinning bodies. We use expressions for the energy and angular momentum flux at infinity that include spin-orbit corrections, together with an assumption of energy and angular momentum balance, to derive equations of motion that are valid for general orbits and for a class of coordinate gauges. We show that the equations of motion are compatible with those derived earlier by a direct calculation.","101"
"J. G. Thompson showed that a finite group G is solvable if and only if every two -generated subgroup is solvable. Recently, Grunevald, Kunyavskii, Nikolova, and Plotkin have shown that the analogue holds for finite-dimensional Lie algebras over infinite fields of characteristic greater than 5. It is a natural question to ask to what extent the two-generated subalgebras determine the structure of the algebra. It is to this question that this paper is addressed. Here, we consider the classes of strongly-solvable and of supersolvable Lie algebras, and the property of triangulability.","102"

As an example, two search regions are investigated: the galactic center and the galactic satellites.","116"
"The nature of non-exponential kinetics in microbial cells inactivation by pulsed electric fields PEF is discussed. It was demonstrated that possible mechanism of non-exponential kinetics can be related to orientational disorder in suspension of microbial cells of anisotropic form. A numerical studies of spheroidal cell suspensions was carried out. The most pronounced deviations from the exponential kinetics were observed for disordered suspensions of prolate spheroids at small electric field strength E or at large aspect ratio a. For partially oriented suspensions, efficiency of inactivation enhances with increasing of order parameter and field strength. A possibility of the PEF-induced orientational ordering in microbial suspensions is discussed.","112"
"A structure with a massive group in its center and a cool expansion outflow outside is studied around the Cen A galaxy with the use of the Hubble Space Telescope observations. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of the flow is dominated by the antigravity of the dark energy background. The density of dark energy in the cell is estimated to be near the global cosmological density. This agrees with our previous result from the neighborhood of the Local group. A notion of the Hubble cell'' is introduced as a building block of the local structure of the universe.","105"
"We introduce a new construction, the isotropy groupoid, to organize the orbit data for split Gamma-spaces. We show that equivariant principal G-bundles over split Gamma-CW complexes X can be effectively classified by means of representations of their isotropy groupoids. For instance, if the quotient complex AGammabackslash X is a graph, with all edge stabilizers toral subgroups of Gamma, we obtain a purely combinatorial classification of bundles with structural group G a compact connected Lie group. If G is abelian, our approach gives combinatorial and geometric descriptions of some results of Lashof-May-Segal and Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson.","103"
"We start a program of background independent quantum gravity in eight dimensions. We begin by considering canonical gravity textita la ""Kaluza-Klein"" in Dd1 dimensions. We show that our canonical gravity approach can be applied to the case of self-dual gravity in four dimensions. Further, by using our previously proposed classical action of Ashtekar self-dual gravity formalism in eight dimensions, we proceed to develop the canonical approach in eight dimensions. Our construction considers different SO8 symmetry breakings. In particular, the breaking SO8S_R7 times S_L7times G_2 plays an important role in our discussion.","102"
"We present a study of interlayer coupling and proximity effects in a La_0.66Ca_0.33MnO_310 nmYBa_2Cu_3O_710 nm superlattice. Using element-sensitive x-ray probes, the magnetic state of Mn can be probed without seeing the strong diamagnetism of the superconductor, which makes this approach ideal to study changes in the magnetic properties across the superconducting transition. By a combined experiment using it in situ transport measurements during polarized soft x-ray measurements, we were able to see no noticeable influence of the superconducting state on the magnetic properties and no evidence for magnetic coupling across a 10 nm YBCO layer.","101"
"Many index theorems both classical and in noncommutative geometry can be interpreted in terms of a Lie groupoid acting properly on a manifold and leaving an elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators invariant. Alain Connes in his book raised the question of an index theorem in this general context. In this paper, an analytic index for many such situations is constructed. The approach is inspired by the classical families theorem of Atiyah and Singer, and the proof generalizes, to the case of proper Lie groupoid actions, some of the results proved for proper locally compact group actions by N. C. Phillips.","108"
"The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy in the sense of Tsallis under Bernoulli shifts was obtained by Meson and Vericat J. Math. Phys. 37, 44801996. In this paper, we propose a revised generalized Kolmogorov-Sinai-q entropy under Markov shifts. The form of this generalized entropy with factor q is nonextensive. The new generalized entropy contains the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and Renyi entropy as well as Bernoulli shifts as special cases. Applying the generalized entropy we discuss its approximate behavior qualitatively, the entropy rate and the sensitive value q of the nonextensive parameter q, which may exit in the interval -2,2 nearby where the generalized entropy return to the classical K-S entropy.","119"
"The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.","107"

"We systematically evaluate the potential energy at the touching configuration for heavy-ion reactions using various potential models. We point out that the energy at the touching point, especially that estimated with the Krappe-Nix-Sierk KNS potential, strongly correlates with the threshold incident energy for steep fall-off of fusion cross sections observed recently for several systems at extremely low energies. This clearly indicates that the steep fall-off phenomenon can be attributed to the dynamics after the target and projectile touch with each other, e.g., the tunneling process and the nuclear saturation property in the overlap region.","101"
"Parametric instabilities driven by partially coherent radiation in plasmas are described by a generalized statistical Wigner-Moyal set of equations, formally equivalent to the full wave equation, coupled to the plasma fluid equations. A generalized dispersion relation for Stimulated Raman Scattering driven by a partially coherent pump field is derived, revealing a growth rate dependence, with the coherence width sigma of the radiation field, scaling with 1sigma for backscattering three-wave process, and with 1sigma12 for direct forward scattering four-wave process. Our results demonstrate the possibility to control the growth rates of these instabilities by properly using broadband pump radiation fields.","108"
"We consider higher-derivative perturbations of quantum gravity and quantum field theories in curved space and investigate tools to calculate counterterms and short-distance expansions of Feynman diagrams. In the case of single higher-derivative insertions we derive a closed formula that relates the perturbed one-loop counterterms to the unperturbed Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients. In the more general case, we classify the contributions to the short-distance expansion and outline a number of simplification methods. Certain difficulties of the common differential technique in the presence of higher-derivative perturbations are avoided by a systematic use of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, which in some cases reduces the computational effort considerably.","107"
"A discrete Laplace transform and its inversion formula are obtained by using a quadrature of the continuous Fourier transform which is given in terms of Hermite polynomials and its zeros. This approach yields a convergent discrete formula for the two-sided Laplace transform if the function to be transformed falls off rapidly to zero and satisfy certain conditions of integrability, achieving convergence also for singular functions. The inversion formula becomes a quadrature formula for the Bromwich integral. This procedure also yields a quadrature formula for the Mellin transform and its corresponding inversion formula that can be generalized straightforwardly for functions of several variables.","107"

We analyze the morphology, stellar populations, physical conditions, chemical abundances and kinematics of the ionized gas, as well as the star-formation activity of each system.","103"
"We report on the realization of a multi-orbital system with ultracold atoms in the excited bands of a 3D optical lattice by selectively controlling the band population along a given lattice direction. The lifetime of the atoms in the excited band is found to be considerably longer 10-100 times than the characteristic time scale for inter-site tunneling, thus opening the path for orbital selective many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Upon exciting the atoms from an initial lowest band Mott insulating state to higher lying bands, we observe the dynamical emergence of coherence in 1D and 2D, compatible with Bose-Einstein condensation to a non-zero momentum state.","111"

While most of the lectures are devoted to the classical channel coding problem over simple memoryless channels, we present a discussion of more complex channel models. We conclude with an overview of the main open challenges in the field.","114"
"We report the observation of a compensation point in the temperature dependence of magnetization data of polycrystalline Sm2Al. Magnetization measurements show that this compound magnetically orders at about 150 K. Below this temperature, the magnetization data shows a compensation point, which shifts with field. Hysteresis loops obtained below the compensation temperature show that the compound possesses exchange anisotropy. Both the exchange anisotropy field and the coercive field are found to be quite large and comparable to those of the classical spin-orbit compensated ferromagnet Sm,GdAl2. The heat capacity data also suggest that there are similarities between Sm,GdAl2 and Sm2Al.","109"
"The long-ranged elastic model, which is believed to describe the evolution of a self-affine rough crack-front, is analyzed to linear and non-linear orders. It is shown that the nonlinear terms, while important in changing the front dynamics, are not changing the scaling exponent which characterizes the roughness of the front. The scaling exponent thus predicted by the model is much smaller than the one observed experimentally. The inevitable conclusion is that the gap between the results of experiments and the model that is supposed to describe them is too large, and some new physics has to be invoked for another model.","110"

Using a novel construction of subcomponents we study the largest component for lambda_nfrac1chi_nn, where epsilonge chi_nge n-13 delta, delta0. We prove that there exists a.s. a unique largest component C_n1. We furthermore show that chi_nepsilon,  C_n1sim alphaepsilon frac1chi_nn 2n and for o1chi_nge n-13delta,  C_n1 sim 2 chi_n frac1chi_nn 2n holds. This improves the result of citeBollobas:91 where constant chi_nchi is considered. In particular, in case of lambda_nfrac1epsilon n, our analysis implies that a.s. a unique giant component exists.","118"
"The recent developments of the phase string theory for doped antiferromagnets will be briefly reviewed. Such theory is built upon a singular phase string effect induced by the motion of holes in a doped antiferromagnet, which as a precise property of the t-J model dictates the novel competition between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. A global phase diagram including the antiferromagnetic, superconducting, lower and upper pseudogap, and high-temperature ""normal"" phases, as well as a series of anomalous physical properties of these phases will be presented as the self-consistent and systematic consequences of the phase string theory.","108"
"One way to understand the nonthermal history of the universe is by establishing the origins of the unresolved and truly diffuse extragalactic gamma rays. Dim blazars and radiogamma galaxies certainly make an important contribution to the galactic gamma-ray background given the EGRET discoveries, and previous treatments are reviewed and compared with a new analysis. Studies of the gamma-ray intensity from cosmic rays in star-forming galaxies and from structure formation shocks, as well as from dim GRBs, are briefly reviewed. A new hard gamma-ray source class seems required from the predicted aggregate intensity compared with the measured intensity.","104"
"Longitudinal density correlations of produced matter in AuAu collisions at sqrts_NN200 GeV have been measured from the inclusive charged particle distributions as a function of pseudorapidity window sizes. The extracted alpha xi parameter, related to the susceptibility of the density fluctuations in the long wavelength limit, exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the number of participant nucleons, N_part. A local maximum is seen at N_part  90, with corresponding energy density based on the Bjorken picture of epsilon_Bj tau  2.4 GeVfm2 c with a transverse area size of 60 fm2. This behavior may suggest a critical phase boundary based on the Ginzburg-Landau framework.","112"
"Modification of standard big-bang nucleosynthesis is considered in the minimal supersymmetric standard model to resolve the excessive theoretical prediction of the abundance of primordial lithium 7. We focus on the stau as a next-lightest superparticle, which is long lived due to its small mass difference with the lightest superparticle. It provides a number of additional decay processes of mathrm7Li and mathrm7Be. A particularly important process is the internal conversion in the stau-nucleus bound state, which destroys the mathrm7Li and mathrm7Be effectively. We show that the modification can lead to a prediction consistent with the observed abundance of mathrm7Li.","105"
"Current techniques for generating a knowledge space, such as QUERY, guarantees that the resulting structure is closed under union, but not that it satisfies wellgradedness, which is one of the defining conditions for a learning space. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the base of a union-closed set family that ensures that the family is well-graded. We consider two cases, depending on whether or not the family contains the empty set. We also provide algorithms for efficiently testing these conditions, and for augmenting a set family in a minimal way to one that satisfies these conditions.","107"
"We investigate dynamical stability of the ground state against a time-periodic and spatially-inhomogeneous magnetic field for finite quantum XXZ spin chains. We use the survival probability as a measure of stability and demonstrate that it decays as Pt propto t-12 under a certain condition. The dynamical properties should also be related to the level statistics of the XXZ spin chains with a constant spatially-inhomogeneous magnetic field. The level statistics depends on the anisotropy parameter and the field strength. We show how the survival probability depends on the anisotropy parameter, the strength and frequency of the field.","102"
"In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal and near optimal DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental redundancy.","118"
"We study the evolution of the universe which contains a multiple number of non-relativistic scalar fields decaying into both radiation and pressureless matter. We present a powerful analytic formalism to calculate the matter and radiation curvature perturbations, and find that our analytic estimates agree with full numerical results within an error of less than one percent. Also we discuss the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation components, which may be detected by near future cosmological observations, and point out that it crucially depends on the branching ratio of the decay rate of the scalar fields and that it is hard to make any model independent predictions.","112"
"Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution QKD, being capable of beating PNS attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently. But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit error rate QBER increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility 99 long period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom 1550 nm wavelength. This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity protocol.","115"
"We compare the roles of fidelity and entanglement in characterizing renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions. It turns out that the scaling parameter extracted from fidelity for different ground states succeeds to capture nontrivial information including stable and unstable fixed points, whereas the von Neumann entropy as a bipartite entanglement measure or equivalently, majorization relations satisfied by the spectra of the reduced density matrix along renormalization group flows often fails, as far as the intrinsic irreversibility-information loss along renormalization group flows-is concerned. We also clarify an intimate connection between the von Neumman entropy, majorization relations, and fidelity. The relevance to Zamolodchikov's c theorem is indicated.","116"
"We describe the positive cone and the pseudo-effective cone of a non-K""ahlerian surface. We use these results for two types of applications: - Describe the set sigmaX of possible total Ricci scalars associated with Gauduchon metrics of fixed volume 1 on a fixed non-K""ahhlerian surface, and decide whether the assignment XmapstosigmaX is a deformation invariant. - Study the stability of the canonical extension 0to cal K_Xto cal Atocal O_Xto 0 of a class VII surface X with positive b_2. This extension plays an important role in our strategy to prove the GSS conjecture using gauge theoretical methods.","107"
"We propose a geometric growth model for weighted scale-free networks, which is controlled by two tunable parameters. We derive exactly the main characteristics of the networks, which are partially determined by the parameters. Analytical results indicate that the resulting networks have power-law distributions of degree, strength, weight and betweenness, a scale-free behavior for degree correlations, logarithmic small average path length and diameter with network size. The obtained properties are in agreement with empirical data observed in many real-life networks, which shows that the presented model may provide valuable insight into the real systems.","104"
"We discuss in this paper two ways of defining the concept of ""effective field theory"": effective field theory defined by low energy effectiveness and effective field theory defined by 4D effectiveness out of higher dimensions. We argue that these two views are actually equivalent, that effective field theories at low energy can in fact be regarded as field theories of higher dimensions confined on a 4D spcaetime. We examine this idea through comparing two different regularization schemes: Momentum Cutoff and Dimensional Regularization, and through analyzing how fields can be localized on branes.","101"
"Secondary structure elements of many protein families exhibit differential conservation on their opposing faces. Amphipathic helices and beta-sheets by definition possess this property, and play crucial functional roles. This type of evolutionary trajectory of a protein family is usually critical to the functions of the protein family, as well as in creating functions within subfamilies. That is, differential conservation maintains properties of a protein structure related to its orientation, and that are important in packing, recognition, and catalysis. Here I define and formulate a new concept, called the selection moment, that detects this evolutionary process in protein sequences. A treatment of its various applications is detailed.","120"
"We prove John Hubbard's conjecture on the topological complexity of the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H'enon map. Indeed, we show that there exist several non-trivial loops in the locus which generate infinitely many mutually different monodromies. Our main tool is a rigorous computational algorithm for verifying the uniform hyperbolicity of chain recurrent sets. In addition, we show that the dynamics of the real H'enon map is completely determined by the monodromy of a certain loop, providing the parameter of the map is contained in the hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex H'enon map.","103"
"This letter presents principles and applications of a virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier that is a simple but effective method to recover small ac signal from noise with high presison. The fundamentals of this method are based on calculation of cross-correlation function. Via this method, we successfully built up a magnetoelectric measurement system which can perform precise and versatile measurements without any analog lock-in amplifier. Using the virtual multi-channel lock-in amplifier, the output of the magnetoelectric measurement system is extensively rich in magnetoelectric coupling behaviors, including coupling strength and phase lag, under various dc bias magnetic field and ac magnetic field.","108"
"Inverse braid monoid describes a structure on braids where the number of strings is not fixed. So, some strings of initial n may be deleted. In the paper we show that many properties and objects based on braid groups may be extended to the inverse braid monoids. Namely we prove an inclusion into a monoid of partial monomorphisms of a free group. This gives a solution of the word problem. Another solution is obtained by an approach similar to that of Garside. We give also the analogues of Artin presentation with two generators and Sergiescu graph-presentations.","104"
"A two-staged, uniaxial magnetoresistive effect has been discovered in SrCo6O11 having a layered hexagonal structure. Conduction electrons and localized Ising spins are in different sublattices but their interpenetration makes the conduction electrons sensitively pick up the stepwise field-dependence of magnetization. The stepwise field-dependence suggests two competitive interlayer interactions between ferromagnetic Ising-spin layers, i.e., a ferromagnetic nearest-layer interaction and an antiferromagnetic next-nearest-layer interaction. This oxide offers a unique opportunity to study nontrivial interplay between conduction electrons and Ising spins, the coupling of which can be finely controlled by a magnetic field of a few Tesla.","102"
"We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, GTW-WT, and the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, BATW-WT. It is shown that the two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel GMAC-WT to illustrate this advantage.","119"
"One interpretation of the unexplained signature observed in the PVLAS experiment invokes a new axion-like particle ALP with a two-photon vertex, allowing for photon-ALP oscillations in the presence of magnetic fields. In the range of masses and couplings suggested by PVLAS, the same effect would lead to a peculiar dimming of high-energy photon sources. For typical parameters of the turbulent magnetic field in the galaxy, the effect sets in at E_gamma  10 TeV, providing an ALP signature in the spectra of TeV gamma sources that can be probed with Cherenkov telescopes. A dedicated search will be strongly motivated if the ongoing photon regeneration experiments confirm the PVLAS particle interpretation.","117"
"First results of observations of the low mass X-ray binary Her X-1HZ Her performed by the INTEGRAL satellite in July-August 2005 are presented. A significant part of one 35 day main-on state was covered. The cyclotron line in the X-ray spectrum is well observed and its position and shape, as well as its variability with time and phase of the 1.24 s pulsation are explored. X-ray pulse profiles for different energy bands are studied throughout the observation. The pulse period is found to vary on short time scales revealing a dynamical spin-upspin-down behavior. Results of simultaneous optical observations of HZ Her are also discussed.","111"
"We provide a non-recursive description for the bounded admissible sets of masks used by Deodhar's algorithm to calculate the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials P_x,wq of type A, in the case when w is hexagon avoiding and maximally clustered. This yields a combinatorial description of the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis elements of the Hecke algebra associated to such permutations w. The maximally-clustered hexagon-avoiding elements are characterized by avoiding the seven classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, 4321, 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, 56781234. We also briefly discuss the application of heaps to permutation pattern characterization.","104"
"We consider the operation of Whitehead double on a component of a link and study the behavior of Milnor invariants under this operation. We show that this operation turns a link whose Milnor invariants of length  k are all zero into a link with vanishing Milnor invariants of length  2k, and we provide formulas for the first non-vanishing ones. As a consequence, we obtain statements relating the notions of link-homotopy and self Delta-equivalence via the Whitehead double operation. By using our result, we show that a Brunnian link L is link-homotopic to the unlink if and only if a link L with a single component Whitehed doubled is self Delta-equivalent to the unlink.","120"
"Let Dge 1 be an integer. In the Enright-Howe-Wallach classification list of the unitary highest weight modules of widetildemrSpin2, D1, the nontrivial Wallach representations in Case II, Case III, and the mirror of Case III are special in the sense that they are precisely the ones that can be realized by the Hilbert space of bound states for a generalized hydrogen atom in dimension D. It has been shown recently that each of these special Wallach representations can be realized as the space of L2-sections of a canonical hermitian bundle over the punctured bb RD. Here a simple algebraic characterization of these special Wallach representations is found.","114"
"The blow-up in finite time for the solutions to the initial-boundary value problem associated to the multi-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a bounded domain is proved. The model consists on conservation of mass equation and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible Euler equations corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance. The proof is based on a-priori estimates for the energy functional for a new observable constructed with an auxiliary function, and it is shown that, under suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data, the solution blows up after a finite time.","107"
"We prove the existence of self-similar expanding solutions of the curvature flow on planar networks where the initial configuration is any number of half-lines meeting at the origin. This generalizes recent work by Schn""urer and Schulze which treats the case of three half-lines. There are multiple solutions, and these are parametrized by combinatorial objects, namely Steiner trees with respect to a complete negatively curved metric on the unit ball which span k specified points on the boundary at infinity. We also provide a sharp formulation of the regularity of these solutions at t0.","101"
"A new necessary minimality condition for the Mumford-Shah functional is derived by means of second order variations. It is expressed in terms of a sign condition for a nonlocal quadratic form on H1_0Gamma, Gamma being a submanifold of the regular part of the discontinuity set of the critical point. Two equivalent formulations are provided: one in terms of the first eigenvalue of a suitable compact operator, the other involving a sort of nonlocal capacity of Gamma. A sufficient condition for minimality is also deduced. Finally, an explicit example is discussed, where a complete characterization of the domains where the second variation is nonnegative can be given.","116"
"In this article it is shown that, Sommerfeld's coefficients for excitonic transitions in quantum wells are determined only with the principle quantum number within the framework of two-dimensional Coulomb potential. This is a consequence of hidden symmetry of two-dimensional Coulomb problem, conditioned by the existence of two-dimensional analog of the Runge-Lentz vector. For the narrow gap semiconductor quantum well with the non-parabolic dispersion law of electron and hole in the two-band Kane model it is shown that two-dimensional excitonic states are described in the frames of an analog of Klein-Gordon equation with the two-dimensional Coulomb potential. The non-stability of the ground state of the two-dimensional Kane's exciton is show.","117"
"Charge redistribution at interfaces is crucial for electronic applications of high-Tc superconductors, since the band structure is modified on a local scale. We address the normal-state electronic structure of YBa2Cu3O7 YBCO at an YBCO-metal contact by first principles calculations for prototypical interface configurations. We derive quantitative results for the intrinsic doping of the superconducting CuO2 planes due to the metal contact. Our findings can be explained in terms of a band-bending mechanism, complemented by local screening effects. We determine a net charge transfer of 0.09 to 0.13 electrons in favour of the intraplane Cu sites, depending on the interface orientation.","108"
"The new formulation of the causal completion of spacetimes suggested in 1, and modified later in 2, is tested by computing the causal boundary for product spacetimes of a Lorentz interval and a Riemannian manifold. This is particularized for two important families of spacetimes, conformal to the previous ones: standard static spacetimes and Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. As consequence, it is shown that this new approach essentially reproduces the structure of the conformal boundary for multiple classical spacetimes: Reissner-Nordstrom including Schwarzschild, Anti-de Sitter, Taub and standard cosmological models as de Sitter and Einstein Universe.","104"

We point out some open problems regarding the prediction of the detailed shape of Zipf's rank plots, which may be tackled by means of such extensions.","102"
"Several aspects concerning the origin of the very strong X-ray activity of T Tauri Stars TTS are still not well understood. Important new insight came recently from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project COUP, a unique 10-day long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud XEST. Based mainly on the results of these two large projects, I will discuss our current knowledge about the location of the X-ray emitting structures in TTS, the nature of their coronal magnetic fields, inferences for pre-main-sequence magnetic dynamos, and the relation between accretion processes and X-ray emission.","111"
"The charged and spinning lightlike solutions are obtained in the Kerr-Schild formalism. In particular, one of them may be considered as an ultrarelativistic boost of the Kerr-Newman solution along the direction of angular momentum. The Kerr singular ring disappears, however, there remains a finite parameter a which determines spin by the Kerr relation Jma. By Jhbar, the parameter a is de Broglie wavelength of the corresponding photon. Electromagnetic field is aligned to the Kerr null congruence. Some of the presented solutions contain singular beam pulse pp-strings like the considered recently gyratons'.","102"
"Isomorphisms of separable Hilbert spaces are analogous to isomorphisms of n-dimensional vector spaces. However, while n-dimensional spaces in applications are always realized as the Euclidean space Rn, Hilbert spaces admit various useful realizations as spaces of functions. In the paper this simple observation is used to construct a fruitful formalism of local coordinates on Hilbert manifolds. Images of charts on manifolds in the formalism are allowed to belong to arbitrary Hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of generalized functions. Tensor equations then describe families of functional equations on various spaces of functions. The formalism itself and its applications in linear algebra, differential equations and differential geometry are analyzed.","117"
"Motivated by applications to quantum field theory we consider Gibbs measures for which the reference measure is Wiener measure and the interaction is given by a double stochastic integral and a pinning external potential. In order properly to characterize these measures through DLR equations, we are led to lift Wiener measure and other objects to a space of configurations where the basic observables are not only the position of the particle at all times but also the work done by test vector fields. We prove existence and basic properties of such Gibbs measures in the small coupling regime by means of cluster expansion.","107"
"We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT. The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the Chellas' STIT.","109"
"A specific, genuinely three-dimensional mechanism of rogue wave formation, in a late stage of the modulational instability of a perturbed Stokes deep-water wave, is recognized through numerical experiments. The simulations are based on fully nonlinear equations describing weakly three-dimensional potential flows of an ideal fluid with a free surface in terms of conformal variables. Spontaneous formation of zigzag patterns for wave amplitude is observed in a nonlinear stage of the instability. If initial wave steepness is sufficiently high ka0.06, these coherent structures produce rogue waves. The most tall waves appear in turns'' of the zigzags. For ka0.06, the structures decay typically without formation of steep waves.","118"
"A number of results for C2-smooth surfaces of constant width in Euclidean 3-space mathbbE3 are obtained. In particular, an integral inequality for constant width surfaces is established. This is used to prove that the ratio of volume to cubed width of a constant width surface is reduced by shrinking it along its normal lines. We also give a characterization of surfaces of constant width that have rational support function. Our techniques, which are complex differential geometric in nature, allow us to construct explicit smooth surfaces of constant width in mathbbE3, and their focal sets. They also allow for easy construction of tetrahedrally symmetric surfaces of constant width.","117"
"A singular foliation on a complete riemannian manifold M is said to be riemannian if each geodesic that is perpendicular at one point to a leaf remains perpendicular to every leaf it meets. We prove that the regular leaves are equifocal, i.e., the end point map of a normal foliated vector field has constant rank. This implies that we can reconstruct the singular foliation by taking all parallel submanifolds of a regular leaf with trivial holonomy. In addition, the end point map of a normal foliated vector field on a leaf with trivial holonomy is a covering map. These results generalize previous results of the authors on singular riemannian foliations with sections.","120"
"A detailed analysis of vacuum Cherenkov radiation in spacelike Maxwell-Chern-Simons MCS theory is presented. A semiclassical treatment reproduces the leading terms of the tree-level result from quantum field theory. Moreover, certain quantum corrections turn out to be suppressed for large energies of the charged particle, for example, the quantum corrections to the classical MCS Cherenkov angle. It is argued that MCS-theory Cherenkov radiation may, in principle, lead to anisotropy effects for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays UHECRs. In addition, a qualitative discussion of vacuum Cherenkov radiation from a modified-Maxwell term in the action is given, together with UHECR bounds on some of its dimensionless ""coupling constants.""","118"
"Forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients. When used in solving physical evolution equations, these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps. Forward algorithms are essential for solving time-irreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps. However, forward integrators are also better in solving time-reversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory. This work compares in detail various forward and non-forward fourth-order integrators using three, fourth, five and six force evaluations. In the case of solving the 2D Kepler orbit, all non-forward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps.","120"
"Some arguments in favour of the existence of tachyons and extensions of the Lorentz Group are presented. On the former, it is observed that with a slight modification to standard electromagnetic theory a single superluminal charge will bind to itself in a self-sustaining circular orbit, suggestive of a modified electromagnetic interpretation of the strong force. Symmetries in that theory are used in the subsequent analysis as a starting point in the search for physically-motivated extensions of the Lorentz Group. There is some discussion of the validity of imaginary coordinates in superluminal transformations of frame. The article concludes with some speculation on the implications for faster-than light travel.","114"
"One of the main open questions in liaison theory is whether every homogeneous Cohen-Macaulay ideal in a polynomial ring is glicci, i.e. if it is in the G-liaison class of a complete intersection. We give an affirmative answer to this question for Stanley-Reisner ideals defined by simplicial complexes that are weakly vertex-decomposable. This class of complexes includes matroid, shifted and Gorenstein complexes respectively. Moreover, we construct a simplicial complex which shows that the property of being glicci depends on the characteristic of the base field. As an application of our methods we establish new evidence for two conjectures of Stanley on partitionable complexes and on Stanley decompositions.","116"
"We compute the dependence of the tunneling current in a double point contact in the k3 Read-Rezayi state which is conjectured to describe an incompressible quantum hall fluid at filling fraction nu125 on voltage, separation between the two contacts, and temperature. Using the tunneling hamiltonian of cond-mat0607431, we show that the effect of quasiholes in the bulk region between the two contacts is simply an overall constant multiplying the interference term. This is the same effect as found for the differential conductivity in cond-mat0601242; the difference is that we do an actual edge theory calculation and compute the full current-voltage curve at weak tunneling.","111"
"Active galactic nuclei AGN are variable on a wide range of timescales, though relatively few systematic variability surveys have been conducted. Previous broad-band both spectral and temporal variability surveys of AGN are limited in their temporal and spectral bandwidth, despite their promise for probing the central engine and black hole mass. We outline optimal properties for variability studies and provide a brief summary of three new variability surveys, two BATSS and DASCH about to begin and the third EXIST possible within the next decade, which will open new windows on the physics and fundamental properties of AGN.","104"
"A novel strongly nonlinear laminar metamaterial supporting new types of solitary and shock waves with impact energy mitigating capabilities is presented. It consists of steel plates with intermittent polymer toroidal rings acting as strongly nonlinear springs with large allowable strain. Their force-displacement relationship is described by the addition of two power-law relationships resulting in a solitary wave speed and width depending on the amplitude. This double nonlinearity allows splitting of an initial impulse into two separate strongly nonlinear solitary wave trains. Solitary and shock waves are observed experimentally and analyzed numerically in an assembly with Teflon o-rings.","102"
"In this note, we extend our previous work Phys. Lett. B 644, 7 2007, astro-ph0609597, and compare eleven interacting dark energy models with different couplings to the observational Hz data. However, none of these models is better than the simplest LambdaCDM model. This implies that either more exotic couplings are needed in the cosmological models with interaction between dark energy and dust matter, or em there is no interaction at all. We consider that this result is disadvantageous to the interacting dark energy models studied extensively in the literature.","101"
"The article is devoted to the investigation of groups of diffeomorphisms and loops of manifolds over ultra-metric fields of zero and positive characteristics. Different types of topologies are considered on groups of loops and diffeomorphisms relative to which they are generalized Lie groups or topological groups. Among such topologies pairwise incomparable are found as well. Topological perfectness of the diffeomorphism group relative to certain topologies is studied. There are proved theorems about projective limit decompositions of these groups and their compactifications for compact manifolds. Moreover, an existence of one-parameter local subgroups of diffeomorphism groups is investigated.","103"
"Several theories for weakly damped free-surface flows have been formulated. In this paper we use the linear approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a new set of equations for potential flow which include dissipation due to viscosity. A viscous correction is added not only to the irrotational pressure Bernoulli's equation, but also to the kinematic boundary condition. The nonlinear Schr""odinger NLS equation that one can derive from the new set of equations to describe the modulations of weakly nonlinear, weakly damped deep-water gravity waves turns out to be the classical damped version of the NLS equation that has been used by many authors without rigorous justification.","116"
"This paper deals with sensors which compute and report linguistic assessments of their values.Such sensors, called symbolic sensors are a natural extension of smart ones when working with control systems which use artificial intelligence based technics. After having recalled the smart sensor concepts, this paper introduces the symbolic sensor ones. Links between the physical world and the symbolic one are described. It is then shown how Zadeh's approximate reasoning theory provides a smart way to implement symbolic sensors. Finally, since the symbolic sensor is a general component, a functional adaptation to the measurement context is proposed.","106"
"We introduce a special class of pairwise-independent self-joinings for a stationary process: Those for which one coordinate is a continuous function of the two others. We investigate which properties on the process the existence of such a joining entails. In particular, we prove that if the process is aperiodic, then it has positive entropy. Our other results suggest that such pairwise independent, non-independent self-joinings exist only in very specific situations: Essentially when the process is a subshift of finite type topologically conjugate to a full-shift. This provides an argument in favor of the conjecture that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold-mixing.","109"
"There is evidence for the existence of massive planets at orbital radii of several hundred AU from their parent stars where the timescale for planet formation by core accretion is longer than the disc lifetime. These planets could have formed close to their star and then migrated outwards. We consider how the transfer of angular momentum by viscous disc interactions from a massive inner planet could cause significant outward migration of a smaller outer planet. We find that it is in principle possible for planets to migrate to large radii. We note, however, a number of effects which may render the process somewhat problematic.","111"

The method to derive polarization observables is detailed and all expressions are given in terms of generalized form factors. The strategy for determining physical form factors in annihilation reactions in presence of two photon exchange is suggested, on the basis of model independent properties of the relevant observables.","119"

A pronounced resonant enhancement of the low-order harmonic yields is found when the Mie plasma frequency of the ionizing and expanding cluster resonates with the respective harmonic frequency. We show that a strong, nonlinear resonant coupling of the cluster electrons with the laser field inhibits coherent electron motion, suppressing the emitted radiation and restricting the spectrum to only low-order harmonics. A pump-probe scheme is suggested to monitor the ionization dynamics of the expanding clusters.","101"
"We study the production of Mueller-Navelet jets at hadron colliders in the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov BFKL framework. We show that a measurement of the relative azimuthal angle DeltaPhi between the jets can provide a good testing ground for corrections due to next-leading logarithms NLL. Besides the well-known azimuthal decorrelation with increasing rapidity interval Deltaeta between the jets, we propose to also measure this effect as a function of Rk_2k_1, the ratio between the jets transverse momenta. Using renormalisation-group improved NLL kernel, we obtain predictions for dsigmadDeltaeta dR dDeltaPhi. We analyse NLL-scheme and renormalisation-scale uncertainties, and energy-momentum conservation effects, in order to motivate a measurement at the Tevatron and the LHC.","118"
"A class of interacting classical random fields is constructed using deformed -algebras of creation and annihilation operators. The fields constructed are classical random field versions of ""Lie fields"". A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the fields constructed are ""quantum random fields"" in the sense that they have Poincare invariant vacua with a fluctuation scale determined by Planck's constant. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle interpretation of a quantum field theory.","112"
"We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum correlations in the parametric luminescence from semiconductor microcavities in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime. As already demonstrated in recent experiments, a ring-shaped emission is obtained by applying two identical pump beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors, providing symmetrical signal and idler beams with opposite in-plane wavevectors on the ring. We study the squeezing of the signal-idler difference noise across the parametric instability threshold, accounting for the radiative and non-radiative losses, multiple scattering and static disorder. We compare the results of the complete multimode Monte Carlo simulations with a simplified linearized quantum Langevin analytical model.","111"
"We study the electromagnetic field equations on an arbitrary quantum curved background in the semiclassical approximation of Loop Quantum Gravity. The effective interaction hamiltonian for the Maxwell and gravitational fields is obtained and the corresponding field equations, which can be expressed as a modified wave equation for the Maxwell potential, are derived. We use these results to analyze electromagnetic wave propagation on a quantum Robertson-Walker space time and show that Lorentz Invariance is not preserved. The formalism developed can be applied to the case where back reaction effects on the metric due to the electromagnetic field are taken into account, leading to non covariant field equations.","113"
"We present a lattice Boltzmann algorithm based on an underlying free energy that allows the simulation of the dynamics of a multicomponent system with an arbitrary number of components. The thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential of each component and the pressure of the overall system, are incorporated in the model. We derived a symmetrical convection diffusion equation for each component as well as the Navier Stokes equation and continuity equation for the overall system. The algorithm was verified through simulations of binary and ternary systems. The equilibrium concentrations of components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree well with theoretical expectations.","113"
"We study the structure of the spectrum of a two-level quantum system weakly coupled to a boson field spin-boson model. Our analysis allows to avoid the cutoff in the number of bosons, if their spectrum is bounded below by a positive constant. We show that, for small coupling constant, the lower part of the spectrum of the spin-boson Hamiltonian contains one or two isolated eigenvalues and respectively, one or two manifolds of atom  1-boson states indexed by the boson momentum q. The dispersion laws and generalized eigenfunctions of the latter are calculated.","100"
"A two-dimensional lattice gas of two species, driven in opposite directions by an external force, undergoes a jamming transition if the filling fraction is sufficiently high. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the growth of these jams ""clouds"", as the system approaches a non-equilibrium steady state from a disordered initial state. We monitor the dynamic structure factor Sk_x,k_y;t and find that the k_x0 component exhibits dynamic scaling, of the form S0,k_y;ttbeta tildeSk_ytalpha. Over a significant range of times, we observe excellent data collapse with alpha12 and beta1. The effects of varying filling fraction and driving force are discussed.","119"
"We analyze how the logarithmic renormalizations in the Cooper channel affect the non-analytic temperature dependence of the specific heat coefficient gamma T - gamma 0ATT in a 2D Fermi liquid. We show that AT is expressed exactly in terms of the fully renormalized backscattering amplitude which includes the renormalization in the Cooper channel. In contrast to the 1D case, both charge and spin components of the backscattering amplitudes are subject to this renormalization. We show that the logarithmic renormalization of the charge amplitude vanishes for a flat Fermi surface, when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional.","101"
"The Landau-ZenerLZ transition of a two-level system coupling to spin chains near their critical points is studied in this paper. Two kinds of spin chains, the Ising spin chain and XY spin chain, are considered. We calculate and analyze the effects of system-chain coupling on the LZ transition. A relation between the LZ transition and the critical points of the spin chain is established. These results suggest that LZ transitions may serve as the witnesses of criticality of the spin chain. This may provide a new way to study quantum phase transitions as well as LZ transitions.","105"
"We consider a class of theories involving an extension of the Standard Model gauge group to an it a priori arbitrary number of colors, N_c, and derive constraints on N_c. One motivation for this is the string theory landscape. For two natural classes of embeddings of this N_c-extended Standard Model in a supersymmetric grand unified theory, we show that requiring unbroken electromagnetic gauge invariance, asymptotic freedom of color, and three generations of quarks and leptons forces one to choose N_c3. Similarly, we show that for a theory combining the N_c-extended Standard Model with a one-family SU2_TC technicolor theory, only the value N_c3 is allowed.","115"
"The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321. This class contains the freely-braided permutations and the fully-commutative permutations. In this work, we show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative pattern classes can be transformed to give generating functions for the corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes. Moreover, this transformation of generating functions is rational. As a result, we obtain enumerative formulas for the pattern classes mentioned above as well as the corresponding hexagon-avoiding pattern classes where the hexagon-avoiding permutations are characterized by avoiding 46718235, 46781235, 56718234, and 56781234.","111"
"A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom interactions.","101"
"We obtain the initial phase space distribution after relativistic heavy ion collision by the CGC shattering method incorporating the uncertainty principle and solve the semi-classical Boltzmann equation which includes the gluon radiation processes. We present as a function of time the attenuation rate of high p_T partons, which have transverse momenta over 6 GeVc, in the medium which is formed after relativistic heavy ion collision. We calculate the elliptic flow as a function of an impact parameter, time and transverse momentum and also present the polar anisotropy, which gives the initial condition for color filamentation.","102"
"In analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics, we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids. They can be used to write the magnetic field in MHD in Clebsch's form. We show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the Ertel's theorem and also, how in the presence of non-trivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant MHD loads. The paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the MHD metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity.","116"
"We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived a graded refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field. We found that the light deflection in a gravitational field can be calculated correctly with the use of this refractive index and therefore the gravitational lensing can be treated conveniently with the optical method. For illustration, we simulated the imaging of gravitational lensing, figured out the time delay between the two images and calculated the lens mass in a conventional optical way.","111"
"We use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binary OGLEGC-228 V228 to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of the component stars. Based on measured systemic velocity, proper motion and distance, the system is a blue straggler member of the globular cluster 47 Tuc. Our analysis shows that V228 is a semi-detached Algol. We obtain M1.512 - 0.022 Msun, R1.357 - 0.019 Rsun, L7.02 - 0.050 Lsun for the hotter and more luminous primary component and M0.200 - 0.007 Msun, R1.238 - 0.013 Rsun, L1.57 - 0.09 Lsun for the Roche lobe filling secondary.","107"
"We present a comparative study of CoO2 layers in the Bi-misfit and NaxCoO2 cobaltates. Co NMR measures the intrinsic susceptibility of the Co layers and is not affected by spurious contributions. At low dopings where room-temperature thermopower TEP is large, Curie-Weiss susceptibilities are observed in both materials. But NMR and muSR experiments find neither charge nor spin order down to low temperatures in Bi-misfit, in contrast to the case of NaxCoO2. This demonstrates that metallicity, charge and magnetic orders are specific of the Na layers in NaxCoO2 whereas strong correlations are generic of the cobaltates physics and could explain the large TEP.","110"
"Noise, corruptions and variations in face images can seriously hurt the performance of face recognition systems. To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.","103"
"We proved that under quantum mechanics a momentum-energy and a space-time are dual vector spaces on an almost complex manifold in position representation, and the minimal uncertainty relations are equivalent to the inner-product relations of their bases. In a microscopic sense, there exist locally a momentum-energy conservation and a space-time conservation. The minimal uncertainty relations refer to a local equilibrium state for a stable system, and the relations will be invariable in the special relativity. A supposition about something having dark property is proposed, which relates to a breakdown of time symmetry.","100"
"An eleven channel digital asynchronous transceiver DAT employing parallel optical link technology has been developed for trigger signal distribution across the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System VERITAS. Combinatorial logic functions are implemented in Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGAs, providing a versatile solution adaptable for use in future atmospheric Cerenkov detectors and other high-energy astroparticle experiments. The device is dead-time free and introduces a minimal skew of 1.6 ns between channels. The jitter on each DAT channel is less than 0.8 ns 95 of the time, allowing communication between telescopes and a central trigger system separated by hundreds of meters, without limiting array performance.","111"
"Adapting a method developed for the study of quantum chaos on it quantum metric graphs cite KS, spectral zeta functions and trace formulae for it discrete Laplacians on graphs are derived. This is achieved by expressing the spectral secular equation in terms of the periodic orbits of the graph, and obtaining functions which belongs to the class of zeta functions proposed originally by Ihara cite Ihara, and expanded by subsequent authors cite Stark,Sunada. Finally, a model of ""classical dynamics"" on the discrete graph is proposed. It is analogous to the corresponding classical dynamics derived for quantum graphs cite KS.","111"

A clear signal of the f_0980 resonance is observed in addition to the f_21270 resonance. An improved 90 confidence level upper limit Br.eta'958 - pi pi-  2.9 x 10-3 is obtained for P- and CP-violating decay of the eta'958 meson using the most conservative assumption about the interference with the background.","104"
"We present in this paper the changes in the room temperature magnetic property of ZnO on Mn doping prepared using solvo-thermal process. The zero field cooled ZFC and field cooled FC magnetisation of undoped ZnO showed bifurcation and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. Upon Mn doping the magnetic hysteresis at room temperature and the bifurcation in ZFC-FC magnetization vanishes. The results seem to indicate that undoped ZnO is ferromagnetic while on the other hand the Mn doped ZnO is not a ferromagnetic system. We observe that on addition of Mn atoms the system shows antiferromagnetism with very giant magnetic moments.","105"
"We update the analytical estimate of the final spin of a coalescing black-hole binary derived within the Effective-One-Body EOB approach. We consider unequal-mass non-spinning black-hole binaries. It is found that a more complete account of relevant physical effects higher post-Newtonian accuracy, ringdown losses allows the it analytical EOB estimate to converge towards' the recently obtained it numerical results within 2. This agreement illustrates the ability of the EOB approach to capture the essential physics of coalescing black-hole binaries. Our analytical approach allows one to estimate the final spin of the black hole formed by coalescing binaries in a mass range num_1m_2m_1m_22  0.16  which is not presently covered by numerical simulations.","117"
"We show that the centrality and system-size dependence of elliptic flow measured at RHIC are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization. We argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25 below the ideal hydrodynamic limit'', even for the most central Au-Au collisions. This lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the Quark-Gluon Plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio. We also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data, in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound.","110"
"Using first principles calculations, we study the microscopic origin of ferroelectricity FE induced by magnetic order in the orthorhombic HoMnO3. We obtain the largest ferroelectric polarization observed in the whole class of improper magnetic ferroelectrics to date. We find that the two proposed mechanisms for FE in multiferroics, lattice- and electronic-based, are simultaneously active in this compound: a large portion of the ferroelectric polarization arises due to quantum-mechanical effects of electron orbital polarization, in addition to the conventional polar atomic displacements. An interesting mechanism for switching the magnetoelectric domains by an electric field via a 180-degree coherent rotation of Mn spins is also proposed.","113"
"We provide an epistemological analysis of the developments of relativistic cosmology from 1917 to 2006, based on the seminal articles by Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lemaitre, Hubble, Gamow and other main historical figures of the field. It appears that most of the ingredients of the present-day standard cosmological model, such as the accelation of the expansion due to a repulsive dark energy, the interpretation of the cosmological constant as vacuum energy or the possible non-trivial topology of space, had been anticipated by Lemaitre, although his papers remain desperately unquoted.","101"
"General analytic energy bounds are derived for N-boson systems governed by semirelativistic Hamiltonians of the form Hsum_i1N sqrtp_i2m2  sum_1ijN Vr_ij, where Vr is a static attractive pair potential. A translation-invariant model Hamiltonian H_c is constructed. We conjecture that H ge H_c generally, and we prove this for N3, and for N4 when m0. The conjecture is also valid generally for the harmonic oscillator and in the nonrelativistic large-m limit. This formulation allows reductions to scaled 3- or 4-body problems, whose spectral bottoms provide energy lower bounds. The example of the ultrarelativistic linear potential is studied in detail and explicit upper- and lower-bound formulas are derived and compared with earlier bounds.","120"
"The expansion rate of Intermediate inflation' lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution. Present study of Intermediate inflation' reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution, leading to late time acceleration. The corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some non-canonical form of kinetic term. Thus the so called Intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic de-Sitter expansion.","112"
"We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.","106"
"We show that, for a generic choice of a point on the Coulomb branch of any N2 supersymmetric gauge theory, it is possible to find a superpotential perturbation which generates a metastable vacuum at the point. For theories with SUN gauge group, such a superpotential can be expressed as a sum of single-trace terms for N2 and 3. If the metastable point is chosen at the origin of the moduli space, we can show that the superpotential can be a single-trace operator for any N. In both cases, the superpotential is a polynomial of degree 3N of the vector multiplet scalar field.","110"
"We show that the category of projective modules over a graded commutative ring admits a triangulation with respect to module suspension if and only if the ring is a finite product of graded fields and exterior algebras on one generator over a graded field with a unit in the appropriate degree. We also classify the ungraded commutative rings for which the category of projective modules admits a triangulation with respect to the identity suspension. Applications to two analogues of the generating hypothesis in algebraic topology are given, and we translate our results into the setting of modules over a symmetric ring spectrum or S-algebra.","108"
"Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques are overly complex. This paper explores an imputation technique based on rough set computations. In this paper, characteristic relations are introduced to describe incompletely specified decision tables.It is shown that the basic rough set idea of lower and upper approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing data. Missing data were predicted with an accuracy of up to 99.","110"
"We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom. We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and lifestyle choices, and respite from technology.","107"
"We prove that a number of classes of separable unital C-algebras are closed under crossed products by finite group actions with the Rokhlin property, including: 1 AI algebras, AT algebras, and related classes characterized by direct limit decompositions using semiprojective building blocks. 2 Simple unital AH algebras with slow dimension growth and real rank zero. 3 C-algebras with real rank zero or stable rank one. 4 C-algebras whose quotients all satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Along the way, we give a systematic treatment of the derivation of direct limit decompositions from local approximation conditions by homomorphic images which are not necessarily injective.","112"
"We review Maxwell's multipole vectors, and elucidate some of their mathematical properties, with emphasis on the application of this tool to the cosmic microwave background CMB. In particular, for a completely random function on the sphere corresponding to the statistically isotropic Gaussian model of the CMB, we derive the full probability density function of the multipole vectors. This function is used to analyze the internal configurations of the third-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe quadrupole and octopole, and we show the observations are consistent with the Gaussian prediction. A particular aspect is the planarity of the octopole, which we find not to be anomalous.","114"
"We discuss a model nonfrustrated magnetoelectric in which strong enough magnetoelectric coupling produces incommensurate magnetic order leading to ferroelectricity. Properties of the magnetoelectric in magnetic field directed perpendicular to wave vector describing the spin helix are considered in detail. Analysis of classical energy shows that in contrast to naive expectation the onset of ferroelectricity takes place at a field H_c1 that is lower than the saturation field H_c2. One has H_c1H_c2 at strong enough magnetoelectric coupling. We show that at H0 the ferroelectricity appears at TT_FET_N. Qualitative discussion of phase diagram in H-T plane is presented within mean field approach.","106"
"We discuss the extrema of the Two Higgs Doublet Model with different physical properties. We have found necessary and sufficient conditions for realization of the extrema with different properties as the vacuum state of the model. We found explicit equations for extremum energies via parameters of potential if it has explicitly CP conserving form. These equations allow to pick out extremum with lower energy -- vacuum state and to look for change of extrema phase transitions with the variation of parameters of potential. Our goal is to find general picture here to apply it for description of early Universe.","104"
"Intelligent Input Methods IM are essential for making text entries in many East Asian scripts, but their application to other languages has not been fully explored. This paper discusses how such tools can contribute to the development of computer processing of other oriental languages. We propose a design philosophy that regards IM as a text service platform, and treats the study of IM as a cross disciplinary subject from the perspectives of software engineering, human-computer interaction HCI, and natural language processing NLP. We discuss these three perspectives and indicate a number of possible future research directions.","104"
"For every rational homology 3-sphere with 2-torsion only we construct a unified invariant which takes values in a certain cyclotomic completion of a polynomial ring, such that the evaluation of this invariant at any odd root of unity provides the SO3 Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant at this root and at any even root of unity the SU2 quantum invariant. Moreover, this unified invariant splits into a sum of the refined unified invariants dominating spin and cohomological refinements of quantum SU2 invariants. New results on the Ohtsuki series and the integrality of quantum invariants are the main applications of our construction.","103"
"We report magnetotransport properties of photogenerated electrons in undoped SrTiO_3 single crystals under ultraviolet illumination down to 2 K. By tuning the light intensity, the steady state carrier density can be controlled, while tuning the wavelength controls the effective electronic thickness by modulating the optical penetration depth. At short wavelengths, when the sheet conductance is close to the two-dimensional Mott minimum conductivity we have observed critical behavior characteristic of weak localization. Negative magnetoresistance at low magnetic field is highly anisotropic, indicating quasi-two-dimensional electronic transport. The high mobility of photogenerated electrons in SrTiO_3 allows continuous tuning of the effective electronic dimensionality by photoexcitation.","110"
"Suppose that a target function is monotonic, namely, weakly increasing, and an original estimate of the target function is available, which is not weakly increasing. Many common estimation methods used in statistics produce such estimates. We show that these estimates can always be improved with no harm using rearrangement techniques: The rearrangement methods, univariate and multivariate, transform the original estimate to a monotonic estimate, and the resulting estimate is closer to the true curve in common metrics than the original estimate. We illustrate the results with a computational example and an empirical example dealing with age-height growth charts.","110"
"We introduce a model-checking tool intended specially for the analysis of quantum information protocols. The tool incorporates an efficient representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of quantum computational tree logic QCTL. The model-checking procedure treats quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.","116"
"In order to obtain more comprehensive information about an celestial object, the radio image must be identified with the optical one. Many years the identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria, which leads to abundant misidentifications and ""empty field"" in optics for the radio sources. For this reason significant part of radio sources do not have identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of radio sources if compared with the optical one. By taking into account the radio refraction, the major number of the radio sources can be successfully identified with the optical objects.","120"
"We study the growth of a directed transportation network, such as a food web, in which links carry resources. We propose a growth process in which new nodes or species preferentially attach to existing nodes with high indegree in food-web language, number of prey and low outdegree or number of predators. This scheme, which we call inverse preferential attachment, is intended to maximize the amount of resources available to each new node. We show that the outdegree predator distribution decays at least exponentially fast for large outdegree and is continuously tunable between an exponential distribution and a delta function. The indegree prey distribution is poissonian in the large-network limit.","119"
"We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.","108"
"Dense granular matter has to expand in order to flow, a phenomenon known as dilatancy. Here we perform, by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, direct measurements of the evolution of the local packing density of a slow and smooth granular shear flow generated in a split-bottomed geometry. The dilatancy is found to be surprisingly strong. The dilated zone follow the region of large strain rate and slowly spreads as a function of time. This suggests that the local packing density is governed by the total amount of local strain experienced since the start of the experiment.","104"
"It had been proposed that overstretching double stranded DNA from the 5-5 ends will produce a new fiber form of dsDNA that is narrower than the S form that has been suggested to result when the dsDNA is overstretched from the 3-3 ends. We present the first comparison of the structures that result when dsDNA is overstretched from the 5-5, 3-3, and 3-5 ends and show that the stability of the overstretched form depends on the ends to which the force is applied. The stability also depends strongly on the ionic environment as well as the presence of reagents that bind to ssDNA.","108"
"In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of accelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of space-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe. This interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some experimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated expansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale.","109"
"We derive an approach to define the causal direction of the wavevector of modes in optical metamaterials, which in turn, determines signs of refractive index and impedance as a function of it real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. We use the developed technique to demonstrate that the interplay between resonant response of constituents of metamaterials can be used to achieve efficient dispersion management. Finally we demonstrate broadband dispersion-less index and impedance matching in active nanowire-based negative index materials. Our work opens new practical applications of negative index composites for broadband lensing, imaging, and pulse-routing.","106"
"This paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares. Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method.","117"
"We study Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a two-band boson Hubbard model, which can be mapped onto a spin-12 XY model with spins coupled to an additional Ising degree of freedom. By using a modified mean field theory that include the effects of phase fluctuations, we show that the transition is first order at both zero and finite temperatures. On the Mott insulator side, there may be reentrance in phase transition. These features are consequences of the underlying transition between competing defect poor and defect rich phases. The relevance of the model and our results to supersolid 4He and cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices are discussed.","116"
"The theory of colorful graphs can be developed by working in Galois field modulo p, p  2 and a prime number. The paper proposes a program of possible conversion of graph theory into a pleasant colorful appearance. We propose to paint the usual black indicating presence of an edge and white indicating absence of an edge edges of graphs using multitude of colors and study their properties. All colorful graphs considered here are simple, i.e. not having any multiple edges or self-loops. This paper is an invitation to the program of generalizing usual graph theory in this direction.","106"
"Proposed by Wolfgang Pauli more than 80 years ago, the exclusion principle has been proven to have a far-reaching consequence, from femtoscopic world to macroscopic, super-dense, and fully relativistic physics. Starting from this principle, we discuss two interesting research topics, which have currently drawn considerable attention in the nuclear- and astrophysics communities; the hypernuclear and neutron star physics. Special attention is given to the electromagnetic production of the hypertriton and the consequences of the neutrino electromagnetic properties in dense matter. We also touch on the new arena which could also be fascinating for physicists; the econophysics.","108"
"When looking for a solution, deterministic methods have the enormous advantage that they do find global optima. Unfortunately, they are very CPU-intensive, and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore. In order to get a result, one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms, that sample the search space without exploring it thoroughly. Such algorithms can find very good results, without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached; but there is often no other choice than using them. This chapter is a short introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization.","115"
"We experimentally investigate the evolution of linear and nonlinear waves in a realization of the Anderson model using disordered one dimensional waveguide lattices. Two types of localized eigenmodes, flat-phased and staggered, are directly measured. Nonlinear perturbations enhances localization in one type, and induce delocalization in the other. In a complementary approach, we study the evolution on short time scales of delta-like wavepackets in the presence of disorder. A transition from ballistic wavepacket expansion to exponential Anderson localization is observed. We find an intermediate regime in which the ballistic and localized components coexist while diffusive dynamics is absent. Evidence is found for a faster transition into localization under nonlinear conditions.","120"
"We present the observation of optical fields carrying squeezed vacuum states at sideband frequencies from 10Hz to above 35MHz. The field was generated with type-I optical parametric oscillation below threshold at 1064nm. A coherent, unbalanced classical modulation field at 40MHz enabled the generation of error signals for stable phase control of the squeezed vacuum field with respect to a strong local oscillator. Broadband squeezing of approximately -4dB was measured with balanced homodyne detection. The spectrum of the squeezed field allows a quantum noise reduction of ground-based gravitational wave detectors over their full detection band, regardless of whether homodyne readout or radio-frequency heterodyne readout is used.","112"
"We present two theoretical schemes for spin filters in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling SOC as well as weak magnetic potential. For case I, the SOC is periodic and the weak magnetic potential is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy intervals. For case II, the weak magnetic potential is periodic while the SOC is uniform. An ideal negativepositive switching effect for spin polarization is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, magnetic potential, and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed.","112"
"We performed a visualization of membrane proteins labeled with 10-nm gold nanoparticles in cells, using an all-optical method based on photothermal interference contrast. The high sensitivity of the method and the stability of the signals allows 3D imaging of individual nanoparticles without the drawbacks of photobleaching and blinking inherent to fluorescent markers. A simple analytical model is derived to account for the measurements of the signal amplitude and the spatial resolution. The photothermal interference contrast method provides an efficient, reproducible, and promising way to visualize low amounts of proteins in cells by optical means.","101"
"Colouring sparse graphs under various restrictions is a theoretical problem of significant practical relevance. Here we consider the problem of maximizing the number of different colours available at the nodes and their neighbourhoods, given a predetermined number of colours. In the analytical framework of a tree approximation, carried out at both zero and finite temperatures, solutions obtained by population dynamics give rise to estimates of the threshold connectivity for the incomplete to complete transition, which are consistent with those of existing algorithms. The nature of the transition as well as the validity of the tree approximation are investigated.","106"
"We present experimental results on the relaxation dynamics of vesicles subjected to a time-dependent elongation flow. We observed and characterized a new instability, which results in the formation of higher order modes of the vesicle shape wrinkles, after a switch in the direction of the gradient of the velocity. This surprising generation of membrane wrinkles can be explained by the appearance of a negative surface tension during the vesicle deflation, due to compression in a sign-switching transient. Moreover, the formation of buds in the vesicle membrane has been observed in the vicinity of the dynamical transition point.","105"
"In this paper we review the applicability of autofluorescent proteins for single-molecule imaging in biology. The photophysical characteristics of several mutants of the Green Fluorescent Protein GFP and those of DsRed are compared and critically discussed for their use in cellular biology. The alternative use of two-photon excitation at the single-molecule level or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is envisaged for the study of individual autofluorescent proteins. Single-molecule experiments performed in live cells using eGFP and preferably eYFP fusion proteins are reviewed. Finally, the first use at the single-molecule level of citrine, a more photostable variant of the eYFP is reported when fused to a receptor for neurotransmitter in live cells.","116"
"We measured the optical properties of mixed valent vanadium oxide nanoscrolls and their metal exchanged derivatives in order to investigate the charge dynamics in these compounds. In contrast to the prediction of a metallic state for the metal exchanged derivatives within a rigid band model, we find that the injected charges in Mn2 exchanged vanadium oxide nanoscrolls are pinned. A low-energy electronic excitation associated with the pinned carriers appears in the far infrared and persists at low temperature, suggesting that the nanoscrolls are weak metals in their bulk form, dominated by inhomogeneous charge disproportionation and Madelung energy effects.","104"
"In this paper we develop a scientific approach to control inter-country conflict. This system makes use of a neural network and a feedback control approach. It was found that by controlling the four controllable inputs: Democracy, Dependency, Allies and Capability simultaneously, all the predicted dispute outcomes could be avoided. Furthermore, it was observed that controlling a single input Dependency or Capability also avoids all the predicted conflicts. When the influence of each input variable on conflict is assessed, Dependency, Capability, and Democracy emerge as key variables that influence conflict.","102"
"We investigate the Feshbach conversion of fermion atomic pairs to condensed boson molecules with a microscopic model that accounts the repulsive interactions among all the particles involved. We find that the conversion efficiency is enhanced by the interaction between boson molecules while suppressed by the interactions between fermion atoms and between atom and molecule. In certain cases, the combined effect of these interactions leads to a ceiling of less than 100 on the conversion efficiency even in the adiabatic limit. Our model predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the efficiency on mean atomic density. Our theory agrees well with recent experiments on 6Li and 40K.","110"
"Magnetic domain patterns under an oscillating field is studied theoretically by using a simple Ising-like model. We propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field. The first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out, and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns. The second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field, and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field.","108"
"We determine from Polyakov loop correlators the screening masses in the deconfined phase of the 31d SU3 pure gauge theory at finite temperature near the transition, for two different channels of angular momentum and parity. Their ratio is compared with that of the massive excitations with the same quantum numbers in the 3d 3-state Potts model in the broken phase near the transition point at zero magnetic field. Moreover we study the inverse decay length of the correlation between the real parts and between the imaginary parts of the Polyakov loop and compare the results with expectations from perturbation theory and mean-field Polyakov loop models.","109"
"Two liquid state theories, the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike equation SCOZA and the hierarchical reference theory HRT are shown, by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, to perform extremely well in predicting the liquid-vapour coexistence of the hard core Yukawa HCY fluid when the interaction is long range. The long range of the potential is treated in the simulations using both an Ewald sum and hyperspherical boundary conditions. In addition, we present an analytical optimised mean field theory which is exact in the limit of an infinitely long range interaction. The work extends a previous one by Caccamo et al Phys. Rev. E,60, 5533 1999 for short range interactions.","117"
"We present measurements of current noise in quantum point contacts as a function of source-drain bias, gate voltage, and in-plane magnetic field. At zero bias, Johnson noise provides a measure of the electron temperature. At finite bias, shot noise at zero field exhibits an asymmetry related to the 0.7 structure in conductance. The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field. Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus where shot noise vanishes, agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron heating.","120"
"We study motion of small particles in turbulence when the particle relaxation time falls in the range of inertial time-scales of the flow. Due to inertia, particles drift relative to the fluid. We show that the drift velocity is close to the Lagrangian velocity increments of turbulence at the particle relaxation time. We demonstrate that the collective drift of two close particles makes them see local velocity increments fluctuate fast and we introduce the corresponding Langevin description for separation dynamics. This allows to describe the behavior of the Lyapunov exponent and give the analogue of Richardson's law for separation above viscous scale.","109"
"We consider a scenario of cosmological inflation coming from a grand unified theory in higher dimensional orbifold. Flatness of the potential is automatically guaranteed in this orbifold setup thanks to the nonlocality of the Wilson line on higher dimensions and the local quantum gravitational corrections are exponentially suppressed. The spectral index of scalar perturbation n_s 0.92 - 0.97 and a significant production of gravitational waves are predicted r TS 0.01 - 0.12 in the perturbative regime of gauge interaction, 1g_4  5-20 X 2 pi R Mpl where the size of compactification is constrained R Mpl  20- 45 by the measurement of scalar power spectrum Delta_R  5 X 10-5.","112"
"The formulation of the Higgs effect is studied in the Glashow--Weinberg--Salam Standard Model, where the constant part of the Higgs potential is identified with the zeroth mode of the Higgs field. In this model, the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential obtained from the vacuum--vacuum transition amplitude is equal to unity at the extremum. This extremum immediately removes tremendous vacuum cosmological density and predicts mass of Higgs field. In this model, the kinetic energy density of the Higgs field and any scalar field can be treated as the rigid state origin that explains Supernova data in the conformal cosmology without the Lambda term.","115"
"Using 281 pb-1 of data recorded by the CLEO-c detector in ee- collisions at the psi3770, corresponding to 0.78 million DD- pairs, we investigate the substructure of the decay D to pi- pi pi using the Dalitz plot technique. We find that our data are consistent with the following intermediate states: rho770pi, f_21270pi, f_01370pi, f_01500pi, f_0980 pi, and sigma pi. We confirm large S wave contributions at low pi pi mass. We set upper limits on contributions of other possible intermediate states. We consider three models of the pi pi S wave and find that all of them adequately describe our data.","115"
"Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology' approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger. I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of stability of biological order.","118"
"The manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising technique for a variety of applications ranging from laser cooling and trapping to coherent atom transport and matter wave interferometry. Optical fields have also been proposed as interesting tools for quantum information processing with cold atoms. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a cold 87Rb atomic cloud falling in the gravity field in the presence of two crossing dipole guides. The cloud is either deflected or split between the two branches of this guide. We explore the possibilities of optimization of this device and present preliminary results obtained in the case of zero-temperature dilute Bose-Einstein condensates.","120"
"Dick Dalitz produced lasting contributions to particle physics for 50 years. Along with Dalitz pairs, Dalitz plots and CDD poles, he did major work in parity violation, hyperon resonance identification, the quark model, and hypernuclei. These topics will be summarized, with some emphasis on the author's collaboration with Dalitz on quark spin and fragmentation correlations, and, particularly, the work on the identification of the top quark and its mass. Short biographical information is interspersed. This paper is based on a presentation at the International School of Subnuclear Physics, Erice 2006.","106"
"In this work the influence of the electric and magnetic fields over a tunneling particle in a rectangular potential barrier is shown, we have taken into account the presence of an impurity at the barrier center and the effects of a hydrostatic pressure parallel to the barrier height considering the BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions. Given that the particle is moving inside a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heterostructures it is evident a change in the transmission coefficient due to the impurity concentration and the presence of the hydrostatic pressure. The potential due to the presence of the impurity is approximate with a second degree polynomial function that resolves the discontinuity generated by heavily modifying the transmission coefficient.","116"
"It is known since 1973 that Lawvere's notion of Cauchy-complete enriched category is meaningful for metric spaces: it captures exactly Cauchy-complete metric spaces. In this paper we introduce the corresponding notion of Lawvere completeness for mathbbT,mathsfV-categories and show that it has an interesting meaning for topological spaces and quasi-uniform spaces: for the former ones means weak sobriety while for the latter means Cauchy completeness. Further, we show that mathsfV has a canonical mathbbT,mathsfV-category structure which plays a key role: it is Lawvere-complete under reasonable conditions on the setting; permits us to define a Yoneda embedding in the realm of mathbbT,mathsfV-categories.","115"
"We study the exact renormalisation group flow for ultracold Fermi-gases in unitary regime. We introduce a pairing field to describe the formation of the Cooper pairs, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. Set of approximate flow equations for the effective couplings including boson and fermionic fluctuations is derived. At some value of the running scale, the system undergoes a phase transition to a gapped phase. The values of the energy density, chemical potential, pairing gap and the corresponding proportionality constants relating the interacting and non-interacting Fermi gases are calculated. Standard mean field results are recovered if we omit the boson loops.","114"
"Plasma instabilities can play a fundamental role in quark-gluon plasma equilibration in the high energy weak coupling limit. Early simulations of the evolution of plasma instabilities in non-abelian gauge theory, performed in one spatial dimension, found behavior qualitatively similar to traditional QED plasmas. Later simulations of the fully three-dimensional theory found different behavior, unlike traditional QED plasmas. To shed light on the origin of this difference, we study the intermediate case of two spatial dimensions. Depending on how the ""two-dimensional'' theory is formulated, we can obtain either behavior.","100"
"We numerically study the dynamical excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate BEC placed in periodic and quasi-periodic 2D optical lattice OL. In case of the repulsive mean-field interaction the BEC quantum tunnelling leads to a progressive soliton's splitting and generating of secondary solitons, which migrate to closest trapping potential minima. A nontrivial soliton dynamics appears when a series of pi-pulses phase kicks are applied to the optical lattice. Such sudden perturbation produces a dynamic redistribution of the secondary solitons, leading to a formation of an artificial solitonic superlattice. Different geometries of OL are analyzed.","100"
"We analyze supersymmetry breaking by anti-self-dual flux in the deformed conifold. This theory has been argued to be a dual realization of susy breaking by antibranes. As such, one might expect it to lead to a hierarchically small breaking scale, but only if the warp factor is taken into account. We verify this by explicitly computing the warp-modified moduli space metric. This leads to a new term, with a power-like divergence at the conifold point, which lowers the breaking scale. We finally point out various puzzles regarding the gauge theory interpretation of these results.","104"
"We study the class of four-dimensional N4 supergravities obtained by gauging the axionic shift and axionic rescaling symmetries. We formulate these theories using the machinery of embedding tensors, characterize the full gauge algebras and discuss several specific features of this family of gauged supergravities. We exhibit in particular a generalized duality between massive vectors and massive two-forms in four dimensions, inherited from the gauging of the shift symmetry. We show that these theories can be deduced from higher dimensions by a Scherk-Schwarz reduction, where a twist with respect to a non-compact symmetry is required. The four-dimensional generalized duality plays a crucial role in identifying the higher-dimensional ascendent.","115"
"Dissipation in the flexural dynamics of doubly clamped nanomechanical bar resonators is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The dependence of the quality factor Q on temperature and the size of the resonator is calculated from direct simulation of the oscillation of a series of Si 001 bars with bare 100 dimerized surfaces. The bar widths range from 3.3 to 8.7nm, all with a fixed length of 22nm. The fundamental mode frequencies range from 40 to 90GHz and Q from 102 near 1000K to 104 near 50K. The quality factor is shown to be limited by defects in the reconstructed surface.","106"
"Stimulated by recent advances in isolating graphene, we discovered that quantum dot can be trapped in Z-shaped graphene nanoribbon junciton. The topological structure of the junction can confine electronic states completely. By varying junction length, we can alter the spatial confinement and the number of discrete levels within the junction. In addition, quantum dot can be realized regardless of substrate induced static disorder or irregular edges of the junction. This device can be used to easily design quantum dot devices. This platform can also be used to design zero-dimensional functional nanoscale electronic devices using graphene ribbons.","105"
"We compute supersymmetric contributions to pion leptonic pi_l2 decays in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model MSSM. When R-parity is conserved, the largest contributions to the ratio R_emu  Gamma pi to e nu_egammaGamma pi to mu nu_mugamma arise from one-loop V-AxV-A corrections. These contributions can be potentially as large as the sensitivities of upcoming experiments; if measured, they would imply significant bounds on the chargino and slepton sectors complementary to current collider limits. We also analyze R-parity violating interactions, which may produce a detectable deviation in R_emu while remaining consistent with all other precision observables.","102"
"Quasi-periodic oscillations QPOs have been discovered in the X-ray emission of many neutron stars and black holes. The QPOs with frequencies greater than about 300 Hz are thought to be produced near the surfaces of neutron stars and the event horizons of black holes. I first summarize some of the most important properties of the QPOs seen in neutron star and black hole systems. I then review some of the models that have been proposed and compare them with observational data. Finally, I describe how these QPOs can be used to determine the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields.","107"
"In this paper we estimate the influence of nonlinear gluon evolution in the production of prompt photons at the LHC pp collider. We assume the validity of collinear factorization and consider the EHKQS parton distributions, which are solutions of the GLR-MQ evolution equations and describe quite well the DESY ep HERA data, as input in our calculations. We find that both single and double photon production are enhanced for low-p_T photons and central rapidities, while this effect is absent for the high-p_T photons. The implications of this effect for the Quark-Gluon Plasma searches and for the QCD background to Higgs are also discussed.","110"
"In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the Taylor-Kuznetsov TK scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.","107"
"Volume stabilization in models with flat extra dimension could follow from vacuum energy residing in the bulk when translational invariance is spontaneously broken. We study a simple toy model that exemplifies this mechanism which considers a massive scalar field with non trivial boundary conditions at the end points of the compact space, and includes contributions from brane and bulk cosmological constants. We perform our analysis in the conformal frame where the radion field, associated with volume variations, is defined, and present a general strategy for building stabilization potentials out of those ingredients. We also provide working examples for the interval and the TnZ_2 orbifold configuration.","113"
"Let G be a smooth algebraic group acting on a variety X. Let F and E be coherent sheaves on X. We show that if all the higher Tor sheaves of F against G-orbits vanish, then for generic g in G, the sheaf TorX_jgF, E vanishes for all j 0. This generalizes a result of Miller and Speyer for transitive group actions and a result of Speiser, itself generalizing the classical Kleiman-Bertini theorem, on generic transversality, under a general group action, of smooth subvarieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.","103"
"From an N1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the gauge group SUN_c x SUN_c' with fundamentals for each gauge group, the bifundamentals and a symmetric flavor and a conjugate symmetric flavor for SUN_c, we apply Seiberg dual to each gauge group independently and obtain two N1 supersymmetric dual magnetic gauge theories with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the dual magnetic superpotentials, we describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of these gauge theories. The case where the above symmetric flavor is replaced by an antisymmetric flavor is also discussed.","112"
"We prove that the Cox ring of barM_0,6, the moduli space of stable, rational curves with 6 marked points, is finitely generated by sections corresponding to the boundary divisors and divisors which are pull-backs of the hyperelliptic locus in barM_3, the moduli space of stable, genus 3 curves, via morphisms that send a 6-pointed rational curve to a curve with 3 nodes by identifying 3 pairs of points. In particular, this gives a self-contained proof of Hassett and Tschinkel's result about the effective cone of barM_0,6 being generated by the above mentioned divisors.","103"
"Removing al least one point from the unit sphere in  R3 allows to factorize the angular part of the laplacian with a Cauchy-Riemann type operator. Solutions to this operator define a complex algebra of potential functions. A family of these solutions is shown to be normalizable on the sphere so it is possible to construct associate solutions for every radial solution to the time-independant Schr""odinger equation with a radial potential, such that this family of solutions is square integrable in R3. While this family of associated solutions are singular on at least one half-plane, they are square-integrable in almost all of R3.","110"
"The E_6U1_N gauge extension of the Supersymmetric Standard Model, first proposed by Ma, is shown to have exactly the requisite ingredients to realize the important new idea that dark matter is the origin of neutrino mass. With the implementation of a discrete Z_2 X Z_2 symmetry, and particle content given by three 27 representations of E_6, neutrino masses are naturally generated in two loops, with candidates of dark matter in the loops. All particles of this model are expected to be at or below the TeV scale, allowing them to be observable at the LHC.","104"
"We show that coupled two level systems like qubits studied in quantum information can be used as a thermodynamic machine. At least three qubits or spins are necessary and arranged in a chain. The system is interfaced between two split baths and the working spin in the middle is externally driven. The machine performs Carnot-type cycles and is able to work as heat pump or engine depending on the temperature difference of the baths Delta T and the energy differences in the spin system Delta E. It can be shown that the efficiency is a function of Delta T and Delta E.","106"
"The identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network. By deriving a general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks, here I show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly bounded by few network parameters. This result provides rigorous conditions for the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the structural control of physical processes in complex systems. The results are illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process.","105"

Such presentations support us to study each knot itself, and the relationship among the knots in the set of lens space surgeries.","102"
"In light of the recent data from BES collaboration for chi_c0to VV, PP and SS, and from CLEO-c for etaeta, etaprimeetaprime and etaetaprime, we present a detailed analysis of the decays of heavy quarkonia into light meson pairs such as chi_c0,2to VV, PP and SS in a recently proposed parametrization scheme. An overall agreement with the data is achieved in chi_c0,2to VV and PP, while in chi_c0to SS we find that a possible existence of glueball-qbarq mixings is correlated with the OZI-rule violations, which can be further examined at CLEO-c and BESIII in chi_c0to SS measurement.","105"
"A recent radio survey of globular clusters has increased the number of millisecond pulsars drastically. M28 is now the globular cluster with the third largest population of known pulsars, after Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc. This prompted us to revisit the archival Chandra data on M28 to evaluate whether the newly discovered millisecond pulsars find a counterpart among the various X-ray sources detected in M28 previously. The radio position of PSR J1824-2452H is found to be in agreement with the position of CXC 182431-245217 while some faint unresolved X-ray emission near to the center of M28 is found to be coincident with the millisecond pulsars PSR J1824-2452G, J1824-2452J, J1824-2452I and J1824-2452E.","118"
"The low-snr capacity of M-ary PSK transmission over both the additive white Gaussian noise AWGN and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero snr are obtained. The spectral-efficiencybit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.","109"
"In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered. For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities. It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy efficiency.","106"
"We study solutions of the time dependent Schr""odinger equation on Riemannian manifolds with oscillatory initial conditions given by Lagrangian states. Semiclassical approximations describe these solutions for small h where h is the semiclassical parameter, but their accuracy for large times is in general only understood up to the Ehrenfest time T  ln1h, and the most difficult case is the one where the underlying classical system is chaotic. We show that on surfaces of constant negative curvature semiclassical approximations remain accurate for times at least up to T  h-12 in the case that the Lagrangian state is associated with an unstable manifold of the geodesic flow.","112"
"In order to compute the packing dimension of orthogonal projections Falconer and Howroyd 1997 introduced a family of packing dimension profiles rm Dim_s that are parametrized by real numbers s0. Subsequently, Howroyd 2001 introduced alternate s-dimensional packing dimension profiles hboxrm P-dim_s and proved, among many other things, that hboxrm P-dim_s Erm Dim_s E for all integers s0 and all analytic sets EsubseteqRN. The goal of this article is to prove that hboxrm P-dim_s Erm Dim_s E for all real numbers s0 and analytic sets EsubseteqRN. This answers a question of Howroyd 2001, p. 159. Our proof hinges on a new property of fractional Brownian motion.","114"
"An iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is presented. We consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases. A number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arXiv:hep-th0609202, and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static, spherically symmetric setups. We conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in 21-dimensional AdS.","103"
"In this article we calculate the electrical conductivity in QED using the 2PI effective action. We use a modified version of the usual 2PI effective action which is defined with respect to self-consistent solutions of the 2-point functions. We show that the green functions obtained from this modified effective action satisfy ward identities and that the conductivity obtained from the kubo relation is gauge invariant. We work to 3-loop order in the modified 2PI effective action and show explicitly that the resulting expression for the conductivity contains the square of the amplitude that corresponds to all binary collision and production processes.","105"
"Let Gamma denote a Q-polynomial distance-regular graph with diameter D geq 3 and standard module V. Recently Ito and Terwilliger introduced four direct sum decompositions of V; we call these the mu,nu--it split decompositions of V, where mu, nu in lbrace downarrow, uparrow rbrace. In this paper we show that the downarrow,downarrow--split decomposition and the uparrow,uparrow--split decomposition are dual with respect to the standard Hermitian form on V. We also show that the downarrow,uparrow--split decomposition and the uparrow,downarrow--split decomposition are dual with respect to the standard Hermitian form on V.","116"
"At the airwater interface, 4,-8-alkyl1,1,-biphenyl-4-carbonitrile 8CB domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same Langmuir film, as multiple bilayers on a monolayer. The edge dislocation at the domain boundary leads to line tension, which determines the domain shape and dynamics. By observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions, we find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference between the coexisting phases in the film. Comparisons with theoretical treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary locates near the center of the film, which means that the 8CB multilayers are almost symmetric with respect to the airwater interface.","120"
"We numerically investigate gauge field instabilities in anisotropic SU2 plasmas using weak field initial conditions. The growth of unstable modes is stopped by non-abelian effects for moderate anisotropy. If we increase the anisotropy the growth continues beyond the non-abelian saturation bound. We find strong indications that the continued growth is not due to over-saturation of infrared field modes, but instead due to very rapid growth of high momentum modes which are not unstable in the weak field limit. The saturation amplitude strongly depends on the initial conditions. For strong initial fields we do not observe the sustained growth.","105"
"Near-infrared photometry of transiting extrasolar planets can be of great scientific value. It is however not straightforward to reach the necessary millimagnitude precision. Here we report on our attempts to observe transits and secondary eclipses of several extrasolar planets at 2.2 micron. Best results have been obtained on OGLE-TR-113b using the SOFI near-infrared camera on ESO's New Technology Telescope. Its K-band transit shows a remarkably flat bottom indicating low stellar limb darkening. Secondary eclipse photometry has resulted in a formal 3 sigma detection, but residual systematic effects make this detection rather uncertain.","100"
"We consider two configurations of a random directed polymer of length L confined to a plane and ending in two points separated by 2u. Defining the mean free energy bar F and the free energy difference F' of the two configurations, we determine the joint distribution function P_L,ubar F,F' using the replica approach. We find that for large L and large negative free energies bar F, the joint distribution function factorizes into longitudinal P_L,u bar F and transverse P_uF' components, which furthermore coincide with results obtained prevously via different independent routes.","106"
"Microfabrication of graphene devices used in many experimental studies currently relies on the fact that graphene crystallites can be visualized using optical microscopy if prepared on top of silicon wafers with a certain thickness of silicon dioxide. We study graphene's visibility and show that it depends strongly on both thickness of silicon dioxide and light wavelength. We have found that by using monochromatic illumination, graphene can be isolated for any silicon dioxide thickness, albeit 300 nm the current standard and, especially, approx. 100 nm are most suitable for its visual detection. By using a Fresnel-law-based model, we quantitatively describe the experimental data without any fitting parameters.","117"
"The discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation. In contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models, in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization, together with a fine-tuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations, render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur. The energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations.","114"
"Security of the three-party quantum secret sharing QSS schemes based on entanglement and a collective eavesdropping check is analyzed in the case of considerable quantum channel losses. An opaque attack scheme is presented for the dishonest agent to eavesdrop the message obtained by the other agent freely, which reveals that these QSS schemes are insecure for transmission efficiencies lower than 50, especially when they are used to share an unknown quantum state. Finally, we present a general way to improve the security of QSS schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state.","104"
"The aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a laser in a plasma. At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To solve this huge linear system, one uses a iterative Krylov method with a preconditioning by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightments on the parallel implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture.","110"
"The Walecka many-body field theory is investigated in the context of quantum nonextensive statistical mechanics, characterized by a dimensionless parameter q. We consider nuclear matter described statistically by a power-law distribution which generalizes the standard Fermi-Dirac distribution q  1. We show that the scalar and vector meson fields become more intense due to the nonextensive effects q neq 1. From a numerical treatment, we also show that as the nonextensive parameter q increases, the nucleon effective mass diminishes and the equation of state becomes stiffer. Finally, the usual Maxwell construction seems not to be necessary for isotherms with temperatures in the range 14 Mevk_BT20 MeV.","114"
"We describe how to compute planar gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling in N4 super Yang Mills by using the gaugestring duality. The computation boils down to finding a certain classical string configuration whose boundary conditions are determined by the gluon momenta. The results are infrared divergent. We introduce the gravity version of dimensional regularization to define finite quantities. The leading and subleading IR divergencies are characterized by two functions of the coupling that we compute at strong coupling. We compute also the full finite form for the four point amplitude and we find agreement with a recent ansatz by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov.","111"
"The contributions of scalar and gauge leptoquarks into widths of K0_L to emp mupm, B0 to emp taupm decays are calculated in the models with the vectorlike and chiral four color symmetry and with the Higgs mechanism of the quark-lepton mass splitting. From the current data on K0_L and B0 decays the mass limits for scalar and chiral leptoquarks and the updated vector leptoquark mass limits are obtained. It is shown that unlike the gauge leptoquarks the scalar leptoquark mass limits are weak, of order or below their direct mass limits. The search for such scalar leptoquarks at LHC and the further search for leptonic decays  B0 to l_i l-_j  are of interest.","119"
"This is an incomplete survey of some non-Abelian discrete symmetries which have been used recently in attempts to understand the flavor structure of leptons and quarks. To support such symmetries, new scalar particles are required. In some models, they are very massive, in which case there may not be much of a trace of their existence at the TeV scale. In other models, they are themselves at the TeV scale, in which case there is a reasonable chance for them to be revealed at the LHC Large Hadron Collider at CERN.","100"
"Using the results found previously for the cooling rates of the emittances, due to collisions between the electrons and the ions, a result is found for the friction force acting on the ions. It is shown that the friction force found here when used to track the ion bunch will give the same emittance cooling rates as those found using the intrabeam scattering theory for electron cooling .For the case of the uniform in space electron bunch distribution, the friction force found here agrees with the friction force result found with the usual theory of electron cooling.","102"

We prove that T is bounded on the Orlicz space Lphi, where phi-1uu1prhou1q-1p for some concave function rho and  T_Lphito Lphile CmaxT_Lpto Lp,T_Lqto Lq.  The interpolation constant C, in general, is less than 4 and, in many cases, we can give much better estimates for C. In particular, if p1 and qinfty, then the classical Orlicz interpolation theorem holds for subadditive operators with the interpolation constant C1. These results generalize our results for linear operators obtained in citeKM01.","106"
"The frictional heating by ion-neutral drift is calculated and its effect on isobaric thermal instability is carried out. Ambipolar drift heating of one-dimensional self-gravitating magnetized molecular slab is used under the assumptions of quasi-magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibrium. We see that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions. The results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in some regions of the slab; therefore it may produce the slab fragmentation and formation of the AU-scale condensations.","107"
"We investigate giant and dual giant type BPS configurations in the near-horizon geometry of a certain 116-BPS AdS_5 black hole. By quantising the space of solutions we count the dual giant configurations and compare with the black hole entropy. This suggests a missing degeneracy factor which we argue comes from an angular momentum quantum number. From the D-brane world volume this arises from BPS electromagnetic waves. We study these waves in the context of giants and dual giants in the black hole near-horizon geometry. We further demonstrate that turning on waves on the world-volume of 18-BPS dual giants in AdS_5 x S5 leads to 116-BPS states with an additional angular momentum quantum number.","119"
"We study the computation of the static quark potential under decimations in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group MCRG. Employing a multi-representation plaquette action, we find that fine-tuning the decimation prescription so that the MCRG equilibrium self-consistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances. In particular, lattice coarsening change of effective lattice spacing on action-generated lattices after decimation is nearly eliminated. Failure to correctly tune the decimation, on the other hand, produces large coarsening effects, of order 50 or more, consistent with those seen in previous studies. We also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances, where no particular improvement is seen for this action.","118"
"The finite temperature phase transition of strongly interacting matter is studied within a nonlocal chiral quark model of the NJL type coupled to a Polyakov loop. In contrast to previous investigations which were restricted to the mean-field approximation, mesonic correlations are included by evaluating the quark-antiquark ring sum. For physical pion masses, we find that the pions dominate the pressure below the phase transition, whereas above T_c the pressure is well described by the mean-field approximation result. For large pion masses, as realized in lattice simulations, the meson effects are suppressed.","100"
"We use continuum theory to show that chirality is a key thermodynamic control parameter for the aggregation of biopolymers: chirality produces a stable disperse phase of hexagonal bundles under moderately poor solvent conditions, as has been observed in it in-vitro studies of F-actin O. Pelletier it et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. bf 91, 148102 2003. The large characteristic radius of these chiral bundles is not determined by a mysterious long-range molecular interaction but by in-plane shear elastic stresses generated by the interplay between a chiral torque and an unusual, but universal, non-linear gauge term in the strain tensor of ordered chains that is imposed by rotational invariance.","118"
"Motivated by the polarization anomaly in the B-phi1020K892 decay, we extend our search for other K final states in the decay B0-phi1020K0 with the K0-Kpi- invariant mass above 1.6 GeV. The final states considered include the K16800, K317800, K420450, and a Kpi spin-zero nonresonant component. We also search for B0-phiDbar0 decay with the same final state. The analysis is based on a sample of about 384 million BBbar pairs recorded with the BABAR detector. We place upper limits on the branching fractions BRB0-phiK168003.510-6, BRB0-phiK3178002.710-6, BRB0-phiK42045015.310-6, and BRB0-phiDbar011.710-6 at 90 C.L. The nonresonant contribution is consistent with the measurements in the lower invariant mass range.","117"
"We elucidate how black holes form in trans-Planckian collisions. In the rest frame of one of the incident particles, the gravitational field of the other, which is rapidly moving, looks like a gravitational shock wave. The shock wave focuses the target particle down to a much smaller impact parameter. In turn, the gravitational field of the target particle captures the projectile when the resultant impact parameter is smaller than its own Schwarzschild radius, forming a black hole. One can deduce this by referring to the original argument of escape velocities exceeding the speed of light, which Michell and Laplace used to discover the existence of black holes.","118"
"We give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed equivariant total Chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed bundles by a linear group action. This fine moduli scheme is described explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions. We use this description to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy Murphy's Law, in the sense of Vakil. The preliminary sections of the paper give a self-contained introduction to Klyachko's classification of toric vector bundles.","107"
"Edge casing is a well-known method to improve the readability of drawings of non-planar graphs. A cased drawing orders the edges of each edge crossing and interrupts the lower edge in an appropriate neighborhood of the crossing. Certain orders will lead to a more readable drawing than others. We formulate several optimization criteria that try to capture the concept of a ""good"" cased drawing. Further, we address the algorithmic question of how to turn a given drawing into an optimal cased drawing. For many of the resulting optimization problems, we either find polynomial time algorithms or NP-hardness results.","108"
"The method for determination of the Supernovae SNe explosions frequency distribution function based on the assumption of explosions independence are offered. The method is based on assumption that the sequence of SNe explosions in an individual galaxy is a Poisson sequence. The essence of the method is in the determination of statistical moments of the frequency of the SNe explosions and subsequent determination of distribution function . The program of numerical simulation has been developed for testing the efficiency of the method. Numerical simulations show that even for a small mean number of registered SNe explosions, method allows restoring initial distribution function. The results of numerical simulations are given.","115"
"We investigate the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a circular waveguide with conducting walls filled by homogeneous dielectric. The parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both TE and TM waves. It is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the TE waves. Various limiting cases are considered. The results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium.","115"
"A k-frugal colouring of a graph G is a proper colouring of the vertices of G such that no colour appears more than k times in the neighbourhood of a vertex. This type of colouring was introduced by Hind, Molloy and Reed in 1997. In this paper, we study the frugal chromatic number of planar graphs, planar graphs with large girth, and outerplanar graphs, and relate this parameter with several well-studied colourings, such as colouring of the square, cyclic colouring, and Lp,q-labelling. We also study frugal edge-colourings of multigraphs.","103"
"The magnetic properties of single crystals of LiHo_xY_1-xF_4 with x16.5 and x4.5 were recorded down to 35 mK using a micro-SQUID magnetometer. While this system is considered as the archetypal quantum spin glass, the detailed analysis of our magnetization data indicates the absence of a phase transition, not only in a transverse applied magnetic field, but also without field. A zero-Kelvin phase transition is also unlikely, as the magnetization seems to follow a non-critical exponential dependence on the temperature. Our analysis thus unmasks the true, short-ranged nature of the magnetic properties of the LiHo_xY_1-xF_4 system, validating recent theoretical investigations suggesting the lack of phase transition in this system.","118"
"In this Letter, we proposed a mixing navigation mechanism, which interpolates between random-walk and shortest-path protocol. The navigation efficiency can be remarkably enhanced via a few routers. Some advanced strategies are also designed: For non-geographical scale-free networks, the targeted strategy with a tiny fraction of routers can guarantee an efficient navigation with low and stable delivery time almost independent of network size. For geographical localized networks, the clustering strategy can simultaneously increase the efficiency and reduce the communication cost. The present mixing navigation mechanism is of significance especially for information organization of wireless sensor networks and distributed autonomous robotic systems.","110"
"The polarization of bremsstrahlung photon in the processes eepmto egammaepm, and epto egammap is calculated for peripheral kinematics, in the high energy limit where the cross section does not decrease with the incident energy. When the initial electron is unpolarizedlongitudinally polarized the final photon can be linearly circularly polarized. The Stokes parameters of the photon polarization are calculated as a function of the kinematical variables of process: the energy of recoil particle, the energy fraction of scattered electron, and the polar and azimuthal angles of photon. Numerical results are given in form of tables, for typical values of the relevant kinematic variables.","112"
"We propose a new algorithm to the problem of polygonal curve approximation based on a multiresolution approach. This algorithm is suboptimal but still maintains some optimality between successive levels of resolution using dynamic programming. We show theoretically and experimentally that this algorithm has a linear complexity in time and space. We experimentally compare the outcomes of our algorithm to the optimal ""full search"" dynamic programming solution and finally to classical merge and split approaches. The experimental evaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either show a lower time complexity or provide polygonal approximations closer to the input discrete curves.","115"
"In this paper I am presenting an overview on several topics related to nonequilibrium fluctuations in small systems. I start with a general discussion about fluctuation theorems and applications to physical examples extracted from physics and biology: a bead in an optical trap and single molecule force experiments. Next I present a general discussion on path thermodynamics and consider distributions of workheat fluctuations as large deviation functions. Then I address the topic of glassy dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium fluctuations due to small cooperatively rearranging regions. Finally, I conclude with a brief digression on future perspectives.","104"
"The description of resources in game semantics has never achieved the simplicity and precision of linear logic, because of a misleading conception: the belief that linear logic is more primitive than game semantics. We advocate instead the contrary: that game semantics is conceptually more primitive than linear logic. Starting from this revised point of view, we design a categorical model of resources in game semantics, and construct an arena game model where the usual notion of bracketing is extended to multi- bracketing in order to capture various resource policies: linear, af64257;ne and exponential.","105"
"We have performed spatially resolved Polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Microscopy measurements on as-grown and annealed Ga0.95Mn0.05As thin films with tensile strain. We find that the films exhibit very strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is increased upon annealing. During magnetic reversal, the domain walls propagate along the direction of surface ripples for the as-grown sample at low temperatures and along the 110 direction for the annealed sample. This indicates that the magnetic domain pattern during reversal is determined by a combination of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a distribution of pinning sites along the surface ripples that can be altered by annealing. These mechanisms could lead to an effective method of controlling domain wall propagation.","118"
"We find actual evidence, relying upon vorticity time series taken in a high Reynolds number atmospheric experiment, that to a very good approximation the surface boundary layer flow may be described, in a statistical sense and under certain regimes, as an advected ensemble of homogeneous turbulent systems, characterized by a lognormal distribution of fluctuating intensities. Our analysis suggests that usual direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, performed at moderate Reynolds numbers, may play an important role in the study of turbulent boundary layer flows, if supplemented with appropriate statistical information concerned with the structure of large scale fluctuations.","110"
"A comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for the pair-creation contact process is presented. In contrast to the ordinary contact process, whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation is added to the pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical series expansions which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process. Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations.","109"
"The feasibility of chalcogenide rib waveguides working at lambda  10.6 microns has been demonstrated. The waveguides comprised a several microns thick Te2As3Se5 film deposited by thermal evaporation on a polished As2S3 glass substrate and further etched by physical etching in Ar or CF4O2 atmosphere. Output images at 10.6 microns and some propagation losses roughly estimated at 10dBcm proved that the obtained structures behaved as channel waveguides with a good lateral confinement of the light. The work opens the doors to the realisation of components able to work in the mid and thermal infrared up to 20 microns and even more.","104"
"The telegraph process models a random motion with finite velocity and it is usually proposed as an alternative to diffusion models. The process describes the position of a particle moving on the real line, alternatively with constant velocity  v or -v. The changes of direction are governed by an homogeneous Poisson process with rate lambda 0. In this paper, we consider a change point estimation problem for the rate of the underlying Poisson process by means of least squares method. The consistency and the rate of convergence for the change point estimator are obtained and its asymptotic distribution is derived. Applications to real data are also presented.","114"
"We define the Z2Z Hodge spaces H_pqSigma of a fan Sigma. If Sigma is the normal fan of a reflexive polytope Delta then we use polyhedral duality to compute the Z2Z Hodge Spaces of Sigma. In particular, if the cones of dimension at most e in the face fan Sigma of Delta are smooth then we compute H_pqSigma for pe-1. If Sigma is a smooth fan then we completely determine the spaces H_pqSigma and we show the toric variety X associated to Sigma is maximal, meaning that the sum of the Z2Z Betti numbers of XR is equal to the sum of the Z2Z Betti numbers of XC.","114"
"Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe in graphene, at energies close to the Dirac point, is analyzed. It is shown that, in clean systems, the orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed, due to the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. In the presence of preexisting localized states at the Dirac energy, the orthogonality catastrophe shows similar features to those found in normal metals with a finite density of states at the Fermi level. The implications for the Kondo effect induced by magnetic impurities, and for the Fermi edge singularities in tunneling processes are also discussed.","104"
"High resolution inelastic neutron scattering is used to study excitations in the organometallic magnet DMACuCl_3. The correct magnetic Hamiltonian describing this material has been debated for many years. Combined with high field bulk magnetization and susceptibility studies, the new results imply that DMACuCl_3 is a realization of the S12 alternating antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic AFM-FM chain. Coupled-cluster calculations are used to derive exchange parameters, showing that the AFM and FM interactions have nearly the same strength. Analysis of the scattering intensities shows clear evidence for inter-dimer spin correlations, in contrast to existing results for conventional alternating chains. The results are discussed in the context of recent ideas concerning quantum entanglement.","116"
"Inspired by the AdSCFT correspondence, we study the pseudoscalar mesons of QCD through a dual embedding in a strongly curved extra dimensional spacetime. This model incorporates the consequences of symmetry and has very few free parameters, due to constraints from five-dimensions and the operator product expansion of QCD. Using as inputs the pion, kaon, and rho masses and fpi, we compute the eta and eta prime masses to be 520 and 867 MeV, respectively. Their decay rates into photons are also computed and found to be in good agreement with data.","101"
"We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check LDPC codes for moderate block lengths up to a few thousand bits that are well-suited for rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request ARQ systems. In addition, these codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes and extended irregular repeat-accumulate eIRA codes for all puncturing rates 0.60.9 base code performance is almost the same and are particularly good at high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously difficult to achieve.","120"
"We introduce an approach to determining the required waveforms to coherently control the optical energy localization in plasmonic nanosystems. This approach is based on the impulsive localized excitation of the nanosystem and time reversal of the generated far-zone field at a single point with one polarization. Despite strong interaction and significant dephasing and dissipation in metal plasmonic systems, and incompleteness of this time reversal, the proposed approach proves to be very efficient in controlling the nanoscale optical fields. Possible applications include nanoscale spectroscopy and photomodification, ultradense memory, and information processing on the nanoscale.","101"
"We study the possible contributions of dimension six operators containing fermion fields to Higgs production at a 500 GeV or 1 TeV ee- linear collider. We show that -- depending on the production mechanism -- the effects of such operators can be kinematically enhanced relative to Standard Model SM contributions. We determine constraints on the operator coefficients implied by existing precision electroweak measurements and the scale of neutrino mass. We find that even in the presence of such constraints, substantial deviations from SM Higgs production cross-sections are possible. We compare the effects of fermionic operators with those associated with purely bosonic operators that have been previously discussed in the literature.","116"
"In 1980 Jimbo and Miwa evaluated the diagonal two-point correlation function of the square lattice Ising model as a tau-function of the sixth Painlev'e system by constructing an associated isomonodromic system within their theory of holonomic quantum fields. More recently an alternative isomonodromy theory was constructed based on bi-orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with regular semi-classical weights, for which the diagonal Ising correlations arise as the leading coefficient of the polynomials specialised appropriately. Here we demonstrate that the next-to-diagonal correlations of the anisotropic Ising model are evaluated as one of the elements of this isomonodromic system or essentially as the Cauchy-Hilbert transform of one of the bi-orthogonal polynomials.","115"
"We use a 1.0-um-wide patterned Cu wire with an integrated nanomagnetic tip to measure the statistical nuclear polarization of 19F in CaF2 by magnetic resonance force microscopy MRFM. With less than 350 uW of dissipated power, we achieve rf magnetic fields over 4 mT at 115 MHz for a sample positioned within 100 nm of the ""microwire"" rf source. A 200-nm diameter FeCo tip integrated onto the wire produces field gradients greater than 105 Tm at the same position. The large rf fields from the broadband microwire enable long rotating-frame spin lifetimes of up to 15 s at 4 K.","107"
"The non-classical rotational inertia fraction of the identical cylindrical solid 4He below 300 mK is studied at 496 and 1173 Hz by a double resonance torsional oscillator. Below 35 mK, the fraction is the same at sufficiently low rim velocities. Above 35 mK, the fraction is greater for the higher than the lower mode. The dissipation peak of the lower mode occurs at a temperature sim 4 mK lower than that of the higher mode. The drive dependence of the two modes shows that the reduction of the fraction is characterized by critical velocity, textitnot amplitude nor acceleration.","106"
"Longitudinal studies could be complicated by left-censored repeated measures. For example, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, there is a detection limit of the assay used to quantify the plasma viral load. Simple imputation of the limit of the detection or of half of this limit for left-censored measures biases estimations and their standard errors. In this paper, we review two likelihood-based methods proposed to handle left-censoring of the outcome in linear mixed model. We show how to fit these models using SAS Proc NLMIXED and we compare this tool with other programs. Indications and limitations of the programs are discussed and an example in the field of HIV infection is shown.","120"
"To clarify the order parameter symmetry of cuprates, the magnetic penetration depth lambda was measured along the crystallographic directions a, b, and c in single crystals of YBa_2Cu_4O_8 via muon spin rotation. This method is direct, bulk sensitive, and unambiguous. The temperature dependences of lambda_a-2 and lambda_b-2 exhibit an inflection point at low temperatures as is typical for two-gap superconductivity TGS with sd-wave character in the planes. Perpendicular to the planes a pure s-wave gap is observed thereby highlighting the important role of c-axis effects. We conclude that these are generic and universal features in the bulk of cuprates.","109"
"The sum of N sufficiently strongly correlated random variables will not in general be Gaussian distributed in the limit Ntoinfty. We revisit examples of sums x that have recently been put forward as instances of variables obeying a q-Gaussian law, that is, one of type csttimes1-1-qx211-q. We show by explicit calculation that the probability distributions in the examples are actually analytically different from q-Gaussians, in spite of numerically resembling them very closely. Although q-Gaussians exhibit many interesting properties, the examples investigated do not support the idea that they play a special role as limit distributions of correlated sums.","106"
"The Navier-Stokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder. This formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergence-free by construction, but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order, whose boundary conditions are coupled. The influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems. The magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior. The influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number.","114"
"We report the first observation of changes in the electronic structure of La_1-xSr_xMnO_3 LSMO across the filling-control metal-insulator MI transition by means of in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ARPES of epitaxial thin films. The Fermi surface gradually disappears near the MI transition by transferring the spectral weight from the coherent band near the Fermi level E_F to the lower Hubbard band, whereas a pseudogap behavior also exists in the ARPES spectra in the close vicinity of E_F for the metallic LSMO. These results indicate that the spectral weight transfer derived from strong electron-electron interaction dominates the gap formation in LSMO associated with the filling-control MI transition.","110"
"We numerically investigated the connection between isobaric fragility and the properties of high-order stationary points of the potential energy surface in different supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures. The increase of effective activation energies upon supercooling appears to be driven by the increase of average potential energy barriers measured by the energy dependence of the fraction of unstable modes. Such an increase is sharper, the more fragile is the mixture. Correlations between fragility and other properties of high-order stationary points, including the vibrational density of states and the localization features of unstable modes, are also discussed.","100"
"We study a simple geometric model of transportation facility that consists of two points between which the travel speed is high. This elementary definition can model shuttle services, tunnels, bridges, teleportation devices, escalators or moving walkways. The travel time between a pair of points is defined as a time distance, in such a way that a customer uses the transportation facility only if it is helpful. We give algorithms for finding the optimal location of such a transportation facility, where optimality is defined with respect to the maximum travel time between two points in a given set.","107"
"The recent detection of the hydrocarbon anion C6H- in the interstellar medium has led us to investigate the synthesis of hydrocarbon anions in a variety of interstellar and circumstellar environments. We find that the anionneutral abundance ratio can be quite large, on the order of at least a few percent, once the neutral has more than five carbon atoms. Detailed modeling shows that the column densities of C6H- observed in IRC10216 and TMC-1 can be reproduced. Our calculations also predict that other hydrocarbon anions, such as C4H- and C8H-, are viable candidates for detection in IRC10216, TMC-1 and photon-dominated regions such as the Horsehead Nebula.","114"
"We investigate the possibility to localize scalar field configurations as a model for black hole accretion. We analyze and resolve difficulties encountered when localizing scalar fields in General Relativity. We illustrate this ability with a simple spherically symmetric model which can be used to study features of accreting shells around a black hole. This is accomplished by prescribing a scalar field with a coordinate dependent potential. Numerical solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations are shown, where a scalar filed is indeed confined within a region surrounding a black hole. The resulting spacetime can be described in terms of simple harmonic time dependence.","108"
"We report on calculations of broadening effects in QCL due to alloy scattering. The output of numerical calculations of alloy broadened Landau levels compare favorably with calculations performed at the self-consistent Born approximation. Results for Landau level width and optical absorption are presented. A disorder activated forbidden transition becomes significant in the vicinity of crossings of Landau levels which belong to different subbands. A study of the time dependent survival probability in the lowest Landau level of the excited subband is performed. It is shown that at resonance the population relaxation occurs in a subpicosecond scale.","102"
"The possibility that around some astrophysical objects there are non-static magnetic fields of enormous intensity suggests that in these situations real particles may be produced. The slowness of the variation is compensated by the huge intensity. The main issue is the production of e,e- pairs annihilating into photons and the direct production of photons, as one of the concurrent process in the GRB gamma ray bursts. Then some simple effects due to the presence of the intense gravity are studied and finally a look is given to the production of other kinds of particles.","101"
"The effects of the peculiar CP conserving phases in unparticle propagators are explored. We find that the phases have a great impact on CP-violation. We adopt the decays B_dto pi pi- and B_dto ell-ell as the illustrators to demonstrate the influences of these phases on the direct CP asymmetries. In particular, we emphasize that unparticle physics is the only model suggested to date that could give the direct CP asymmetries in B_dto ell- ell as large as 15. We also point out that the unparticle phases could be probed in Bto K ell ell- decays by using T-odd correlations.","105"

The new CuCu results are studied with hydro-motivated blast-wave and statistical model frameworks in order to characterize the freeze-out properties of this system. Along with measurements from AuAu and pp collisions, the obtained freeze-out parameters are discussed as a function of collision energy, system size, centrality and inferred energy density. This multi-dimensional systematic study reveals the importance of the collision geometry and furthers our understanding of the QCD phases.","100"

The devices are characterized with microwave spectroscopy and temperature dependence studies, and Coulomb staircases are shown to be e-periodic in all samples. However, coherent control is still possible with non-adiabatic voltage pulses. Coherent oscillation experiments and a relaxation time measurement were performed using a charge derivative readout technique.","113"

"Using AdSCFT correspondence and the Euclidean action formalism for black hole entropy Kraus and Larsen have argued that the entropy of a BTZ black hole in three dimensional supergravity with 0,4 supersymmetry does not receive any correction from higher derivative terms in the action. We argue that as a consequence of AdSCFT correspondence the action of a three dimensional supergravity with 0,4 supersymmetry cannot receive any higher derivative correction except for those which can be removed by field redefinition. The non-renormalization of the entropy then follows as a consequence of this and the invariance of Wald's formula under a field redefinition.","106"
"There is accumulating evidence in lattice QCD that attempts to locate confining fields in vacuum configurations bring results explicitly depending on tha lattice spacing that is, ultraviolet cut off. Generically, one deals with low-dimensional vacuum defects which occupy a vanishing fraction of the total four-dimensional space. We review briefly existing data on the vacuum defects and their significance for confinement and other nonperturbative phenomena. We introduce the notion of quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy, rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were triggered by creation of the Sakata model.","108"
"The laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be defined for each such manifestation.","112"
"In the work we demonstrate the formation of new type of polariton on the interface between a cuprous oxide slab and a polystyrene micro-sphere placed on the slab. The evanescent field of the resonant whispering gallery mode WGM has a substantial gradient, and therefore effectively couples with the quadrupole 1S excitons in cuprous oxide. This evanescent polariton has a long life-time 1.7 ns, which is determined only by its excitonic component. The polariton lower branch has a well pronounced minimum. This suggests that this excitation can be utilized for BEC. The spatial coherence of the polariton can be improved by assembling the micro-spheres in a linear chain.","115"
"We investigate the phases of the ionic Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC. At half-filling, when the interaction strength or the staggered potential dominate we find Mott and band insulators, respectively. When these two energies are of the same order we find a metallic region. Charge and magnetic structure factors demonstrate the presence of antiferromagnetism only in the Mott region, although the externally imposed density modulation is present everywhere in the phase diagram. Away from half-filling, other insulating phases are found. Kinetic energy correlations do not give clear signals for the existence of a bond-ordered phase.","113"
"A significant discrepancy exists between experiment and calculations of the muon's magnetic moment. We find that standard formulas for the hadronic vacuum polarization term have overlooked pionic states known to exist. Coulomb binding alone guarantees pi pi- states that quantum mechanically mix with the rho meson. A simple 2-state mixing model explains the magnetic moment discrepancy for a mixing angle of order alpha sim 10-2. The relevant physical state is predicted to give a tiny observable bump in the ratio Rs of e e- annihilation at a low energy not previously searched. The burden of proof is reversed for claims that conventional physics cannot explain the muon's anomalous moment.","118"
"We study subrings in the Chow ring CHA_Bbb Q of an abelian variety A, stable under the Fourier transform with respect to an arbitrary polarization. We prove that by taking Pontryagin products of classes of dimension leq 1 one gets such a subring. We also show how to construct finite-dimensional Fourier-stable subrings in CHA_Bbb Q. Another result concerns the relation between the Pontryagin product and the usual product on the CHA_Bbb Q. We prove that the operator of the usual product with a cycle is a differential operator with respect to the Pontryagin product and compute its order in terms of the Beauville's decomposition of CHA_Bbb Q.","114"
"Graphene nanoribbons are quasi-one-dimensional meterials with finite width. Characterizing a wide class of nanoribbons by edge shape and width, we make a systematic analysis of their electronic properties. The band gap structure of nanoribbons is shown to exhibit a valley structure with stream-like sequences of metallic or almost metallic nanoribbons. Among them, all zigzag nanoribbons are metallic, and armchair nanoribbons are metallic by period of 3. We find that these stream-like sequences correspond to equi-width curves, and that the band gap of chiral and armchair nanoribbons oscillate as a function of the width. Furthermore a possible application of nanoribbons to nanoelectronics is discussed.","113"
"We study the constraints imposed by the Hadamard condition on the two-point function of local states of a scalar quantum field conformally coupled to a gravitational background. We propose a method to assign a stress tensor to the state-dependent part of the two point function which arises as a conserved tensor with an anomalous trace. To characterize the local Hadamard states of physical interest we apply a super-selection rule relating this quantum stress tensor to the matter stress tensor of a conformal invariant gravitational model subject to a conformal symmetry breaking term. This implies that the determination of a Hadamard state may be considered as an integral part of its gravitational coupling via the back-reaction effect.","120"
"The two dimensional analog of the Hadamard state condition is used to specify the local Hadamard states associated with a linear quantum field coupled to a two dimensional gravitational background. To characterize a local Hadamard state corresponding to a physical vacuum state, we apply a superselection rule in which the state dependent part of the two-point function is determined in terms of a dynamical scalar field. It implies a basic connection between the vacuum state and a scalar field coupled to gravity. We study the characteristics of the Hadamard vacuum state through this superselection rule using two different background metrics, the two dimensional analog of the schwarzschild and FRW metric.","116"
"Since S-parameter measurements without uncertainty cannot claim any credibility, the uncertainties in full two-port Vector Network Analyser VNA measurements were estimated using total complex differentials Total Differential Errors. To express precisely a comparison relation between complex differential errors, their differential error regions DERs were used. To demonstrate the method in the most accurate case of a direct zero-length thru, practical results are presented for commonly used Z-parameters of a simple, two-port, DC resistive T-network, which was built and tested against frequency with a VNA measurement system extended by two lengthy transmission lines.","102"
"In this write-up, we summarize our recent analysis of radiative decays involving light scalar mesons. Our analysis using the vector meson dominance model at tree level indicates that it may be difficult to distinguish qqbarqbarq picture and qbarq picture for the light scalar nonet. Our result on the process of phi to pi0 eta gamma shows that the derivative-type f_0 KbarK interaction reproduces experimental data below 950 GeV well, but gives a poor fit above 950 GeV, i.e., in the energy region around the mass of a_0980, but that the discrepancy can be compensated by the effect of the K loop.","109"
"Fermi, Pasta and Ulam observed, that the excitation of a low frequency normal mode in a nonlinear acoustic chain leads to localization in normal mode space on large time scales. Fast equipartition and thus complete delocalization in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain is restored if relevant intensive control parameters exceed certain threshold values. We compare recent results on periodic orbits in the localization regime and resonant normal forms in a weak delocalization regime, and relate them to various resonance overlap criteria. We show that the approaches quantitatively agree in their estimate of the localization-delocalization threshold. A key ingredient for this transition are resonances of overtones.","111"
"Differential cross sections for the reaction gamma p to p pi0 have been measured with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer CLAS and a tagged photon beam with energies from 0.675 to 2.875 GeV. The results reported here possess greater accuracy in the absolute normalization than previous measurements. They disagree with recent CB-ELSA measurements for the process at forward scattering angles. Agreement with the SAID and MAID fits is found below 1 GeV. The present set of cross sections has been incorporated into the SAID database, and exploratory fits have been extended to 3 GeV. Resonance couplings have been extracted and compared to previous determinations.","111"
"A full Fermi surface exists in underdoped high-temperature superconductors if the temperature T lies above the pseudogap temperature T. Below T only arcs of Fermi surface survive, scaling with TT as T - 0, with T displaying strong doping dependence. There is no accepted explanation for this behavior. We show that generalizing the BCS theory of normal superconductivity to include d-wave pairs and antiferromagnetism leads to the origin and doping dependence of the T scale, and a quantitative description of Fermi arcs. These results place strong constraints on viable theories of high-temperature superconductivity.","100"
"The refractive index of a dielectric medium comprising both passive and inverted components in its permittivity was determined using two methods: i in the time domain, a finite-difference algorithm to compute the frequency-domain reflectance from reflection data for a pulsed plane wave that is normally incident on a dielectric half-space, and ii in the frequency domain, the deflection of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam on transmission through a dielectric slab. The dielectric medium was found to be an active medium with a negative real part for its refractive index. Thereby, a recent controversy in the scientific literature was resolved.","107"
"Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2, and let W be the ring of infinite Witt vectors over k. Suppose D is a dihedral 2-group. We prove that the universal deformation ring RD,V of an endo-trivial kD-module V is always isomorphic to WmathbbZ2timesmathbbZ2. As a consequence we obtain a similar result for modules V with stable endomorphism ring k belonging to an arbitrary nilpotent block with defect group D. This confirms for such V conjectures on the ring structure of the universal deformation ring of V which had previously been shown for V belonging to cyclic blocks or to blocks with Klein four defect groups.","114"
"We have investigated the flux transfer characteristics of a switchable flux transformer comprising a superconducting loop and a DC superconducting quantum interference device DC-SQUID. This system can be used to couple multiple flux qubits with a controllable coupling strength. Its characteristics were measured using a flux input coil and a DC-SQUID for readout coupled to the transformer loop in a dilution refrigerator. The observed characteristics are consistent with the calculation results. We have demonstrated the reversal of the slope of the characteristics and the complete switching off of the transformer, which are useful features for its application as a controllable coupler for flux qubits.","110"
"Quantum relativity as a generalized, or rather deformed, version of Einstein relativity with a linear realization on a classical six-geometry beyond the familiar setting of space-time offer a new framework to think about the quantum space-time structure. The formulation requires two deformations to be implemented through imposing two fundamental invariants. We take them to be the independent Planck mass and Planck length. Together, they gives the quantum hbar. The scheme leads to small boldmathprotect SO2,4 as the relativity symmetry. The quantum world has an AdS_5 classical' geometry, which is parallel to the ""conformal universe"", but not scale invariant.","112"
"Sensitivity to temporal variation of the fundamental constants may be strongly enhanced in transitions between narrow close levels of different nature.

"Stellar Oscillations Network Group SONG is an initiative aimed at designing and building a network of 1m-class telescopes dedicated to asteroseismology and planet hunting. SONG will have 8 identical telescope nodes each equipped with a high-resolution spectrograph and an iodine cell for obtaining precision radial velocities and a CCD camera for guiding and imaging purposes. The main asteroseismology targets for the network are the brightest V6 stars. In order to improve performance and reduce maintenance costs the instrumentation will only have very few modes of operation. In this contribution we describe the motivations for establishing a network, the basic outline of SONG and the expected performance.","112"
"We have recently pointed out that color magnetic field is generated in dense quark matter, i.e. color ferromagnetic phase of quark matter. Using light cone quantization, we show that gluons occupying the lowest Landau level under the color magnetic field effectively form a two dimensional quantum well layer, in which infinitely many zero modes of the gluons are present. We discuss that the zero modes of the gluons form a quantum Hall state by interacting repulsively with each other, just as electrons do in semiconductors. Such a ferromagnetic quark matter with the layer structure of the gluons is a possible origin of extremely strong magnetic field observed in magnetars.","118"
"We present a new interatomic potential for water captured in a charge-transfer embedded atom method EAM framework. The potential accounts for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms as a function of the local chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of water.","116"
"We study the dynamics of initial nucleation processes of photoinduced structural change of molecular crystals. In order to describe the nonadiabatic transition in each molecule, we employ a model of localized electrons coupled with a fully quantized phonon mode, and the time-dependent Schr""odinger equation for the model is numerically solved. We found a minimal model to describe the nucleation induced by injection of an excited state of a single molecule in which multiple types of intermolecular interactions are required. In this model coherently driven molecular distortion plays an important role in the successive conversion of electronic states which leads to photoinduced cooperative phenomena.","111"
"The recent PRB 73, 224501 2006 henceforth referred as Ref.cite0 asserts that self-heating decreases with sample area reduction and claims to identify the intrinsic cause of ITS in submicrometre mesa'. I will show that this assertion lacks substantiation. I will further demonstrate that one and the same RT and the parameter-free Newton's Law of Cooling describe quantitatively a rich variety of ITS behaviours taken by Ref.cite0 above and below T_c at bath temperatures spanned over 150K. Thus this finding presents strong evidence in favour of heating as the cause of the intrinsic tunnelling spectra' ITS promoted by Ref.cite0.","106"
"We obtain a system of exact solutions of the Dirac equation for an electron moving in a constant homogeneous external magnetic field with account of its vacuum magnetic moment and assumed Lorentz invariance violation in the minimal CPT-odd form in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Using these solutions, characteristics of the particle synchrotron radiation are calculated, and possible observable effects caused by the Lorentz non-invariant interaction are described. We demonstrate that the angular distribution of the radiation has specific asymmetry, which can be explained as a consequence of non-conservation of transversal electron polarization in the presence of a background Lorentz non-invariant condensate field.","111"
"Holzer and Holzer Discrete Applied Mathematics 1443:345--358, 2004 proved that the TantrixTM rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the TantrixTM rotation puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the solution, which implies that the unique TantrixTM rotation puzzle problem is as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP.","115"
"A detailed quantum-electrodynamic calculation of muon pair creation in laser-driven electron-positron collisions is presented. The colliding particles stem from a positronium atom exposed to a superintense laser wave of linear polarization, which allows for high luminosity. The threshold laser intensity of this high-energy reaction amounts to a few 1022 Wcm2 in the near-infrared frequency range. The muons produced form an ultrarelativistic, strongly collimated beam, which is explicable in terms of a classical simple-man's model. Our results indicate that the process can be observed at high positronium densities with the help of present-day laser technology.","103"
"The use of off-resonant standing light waves to manipulate ultracold atoms is investigated. Previous work has illustrated that optical pulses can provide efficient beam-splitting and reflection operations for atomic wave packets. The performance of these operations is characterized experimentally using Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a weak magnetic trap. Under optimum conditions, fidelities of up to 0.99 for beam splitting and 0.98 for reflection are observed, and splitting operations of up to third order are achieved. The dependence of the operations on light intensity and atomic velocity is measured and found to agree well with theoretical estimates.","103"
"This paper studies the performance of a wireless data network using energy-efficient power control techniques when different multiple access schemes, namely direct-sequence code division multiple access DS-CDMA and impulse-radio ultrawideband IR-UWB, are considered. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By making use of noncooperative game-theoretic models and large-system analysis tools, explicit expressions for the achieved utilities at the Nash equilibrium are derived in terms of the network parameters. A measure of the loss of DS-CDMA with respect to IR-UWB is proposed, which proves substantial equivalence between the two schemes. Simulation results are provided to validate the analysis.","117"
"By using only combinatorial data on two posets X and Y, we construct a set of so-called formulas. A formula produces simultaneously, for any abelian category A, a functor between the categories of complexes of diagrams over X and Y with values in A. This functor induces a triangulated functor between the corresponding derived categories. This allows us to prove, for pairs X, Y of posets sharing certain common underlying combinatorial structure, that for any abelian category A, regardless of its nature, the categories of diagrams over X and Y with values in A are derived equivalent.","109"
"This paper explores a comparative study of both the linear and kernel implementations of three of the most popular Appearance-based Face Recognition projection classes, these being the methodologies of Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. The experimental procedure provides a platform of equal working conditions and examines the ten algorithms in the categories of expression, illumination, occlusion and temporal delay. The results are then evaluated based on a sequential combination of assessment tools that facilitate both intuitive and statistical decisiveness among the intra and interclass comparisons. The best categorical algorithms are then incorporated into a hybrid methodology, where the advantageous effects of fusion strategies are considered.","119"
"The non-Abelian feature of quantum chromodynamics QCD results in the gluons losing more energy than quarks in the medium formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Experimental results in pp collisions when compared to NLO pQCD calculations show that at high transverse momentum pT the produced protonsanti-protons are dominantly from gluon jets and charged pions have substantial contribution from quark jets. If such a scenario is applied to heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, one would expect the difference in quark and gluon energy loss to have an effect on measured observables, such as high pT pbarppi ratios and the nuclear modification factor for various particles species. We discuss the experimental results and some possible future measurements.","120"
"Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators. One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.","115"
"We investigate the entanglement between a spin and its environment in impurity systems which exhibit a second-order quantum phase transition. As an application, we employ the spin-boson model, describing a two-level system spin coupled to a subohmic bosonic bath with power-law spectral density, cal Jomegapropto omegas and 0s1. Combining Wilson's Numerical Renormalization Group method and hyperscaling relations, we demonstrate that the entanglement between the spin and its environment is always enhanced at the quantum phase transition resulting in a visible cusp maximum in the entropy of entanglement. We formulate a correspondence between criticality and impurity entanglement entropy, and the relevance of these ideas to Nano-systems is outlined.","117"
"The compatibility of the pure power law infrared solution of QCD and lattice data for the gluon and ghost propagators in Landau gauge is discussed. For the gluon propagator, the lattice data is well described by a pure power law with an infrared exponent kappa sim 0.53, in the Dyson-Schwinger notation. kappa is measured using a technique that suppresses finite volume effects. This value implies a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator, in agreement with the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario. For the ghost propagator, the lattice data seem not to follow a pure power law, at least for the range of momenta accessed in our simulation.","114"
"High-dynamic range radio observations of Westerlund 1 are presented that detect a total of 21 stars in the young massive stellar cluster, the richest population of radio emitting stars known for any young massive galactic cluster in the Galaxy. We will discuss some of the more remarkable objects, including the highly radio luminous supergiant Be star W9, with an estimated mass-loss rate 10-3 solarmassyr, comparable to that of eta Carina, along with the somewhat unusual detection of thermal emission from almost all the cool red supergiants and yellow hypergiants. There is strong supporting evidence from X-ray observations that each of the WR stars with radio emission are likely to be colliding-wind binaries","119"
"Special solutions of string theory in supercritical dimensions can interpolate in time between theories with different numbers of spacetime dimensions via dimension quenching and different amounts of worldsheet supersymmetry via c-duality. These solutions connect supercritical string theories to the more familiar string duality web in ten dimensions, and provide a precise link between supersymmetric and purely bosonic string theories. Dimension quenching and c-duality appear to be natural concepts in string theory, giving rise to large networks of interconnected theories. We describe some of these networks in detail and discuss general consistency constraints on the types of transitions that arise in this framework.","108"
"This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP serial machines regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links less inertia and better dynamic performances, which makes the orthoglide well suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.","112"
"The ensemble CUEq of truncated random unitary matrices is a deformation of the usual Circular Unitary Ensemble depending on a discrete non-negative parameter q. CUEq is an exactly solved model of random contraction matrices originally introduced in the context of scattering theory. In this article, we exhibit a connection between CUEq and Fisher's random-turns vicious walker model from statistical mechanics. In particular, we show that the moment generating function of the trace of a random matrix from CUEq is a generating series for the partition function of Fisher's model, when the walkers are assumed to represent mutually attracting particles.","107"
"Magneto-optical imaging was used to observe dendritic flux avalanches connecting the outer and inner edges of a ring-shaped superconducting MgB2 film. Such avalanches create heated channels across the entire width of the ring, and inject large amounts of flux into the central hole. By measuring the injected flux and the corresponding reduction of current, which is typically 15, we estimate the maximum temperature in the channel to be 100 K, and the duration of the process to be on the order of a microsecond. Flux creep simulations reproduce all the observed features in the current density before and after injection events.","109"
"We define the alternating sign matrix polytope as the convex hull of nxn alternating sign matrices and prove its equivalent description in terms of inequalities. This is analogous to the well known result of Birkhoff and von Neumann that the convex hull of the permutation matrices equals the set of all nonnegative doubly stochastic matrices. We count the facets and vertices of the alternating sign matrix polytope and describe its projection to the permutohedron as well as give a complete characterization of its face lattice in terms of modified square ice configurations. Furthermore we prove that the dimension of any face can be easily determined from this characterization.","112"
"Results from a phenomenological analysis for diffractive hadroproduction of heavy flavors at high energies are reported. Diffractive production of charm, bottom and top are calculated using Regge factorization, taking into account recent experimental determination of the diffractive parton density functions in Pomeron by the H1 Collaboration at DESY-HERA. In addition, multiple-Pomeron corrections are considered through the rapidity gap survival probability factor. We give numerical predictions for single diffractive as well as double Pomeron exchange DPE cross sections, which agree with the available data for diffractive production of charm and beauty. We make estimates which could be compared to future measurements at the LHC.","112"
"We report on use of a radiation pressure induced restoring force, the optical spring effect, to optically dilute the mechanical damping of a 1 gram suspended mirror, which is then cooled by active feedback cold damping. Optical dilution relaxes the limit on cooling imposed by mechanical losses, allowing the oscillator mode to reach a minimum temperature of 6.9 mK, a factor of 40000 below the environmental temperature. A further advantage of the optical spring effect is that it can increase the number of oscillations before decoherence by several orders of magnitude. In the present experiment we infer an increase in the dynamical lifetime of the state by a factor of 200.","120"
"The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator.","107"
"In this paper we investigate the thermodynamical properties of unbalanced'' superconductors, namely, systems where the electron-boson coupling lambda is different in the self-energy and in the Cooper channels. This situation is encountered in a variety of situation, as for instance in d-wave superconductors. Quite interesting is the case where the pairing in the self-energy is smaller than the one in the gap equation. In this case we predict a finite critical value lambda_c where the superconducting critical temperature T_c diverges but the zero temperature gap is still finite. The specific heat, magnetic critical field and the penetration depth are also evaluated.","111"
"We first analyze the integrated density of states IDS of periodic Schr""odinger operators on an amenable covering manifold. A criterion for the continuity of the IDS at a prescribed energy is given along with examples of operators with both continuous and discontinuous IDS'. Subsequently, alloy-type perturbations of the periodic operator are considered. The randomness may enter both via the potential and the metric. A Wegner estimate is proven which implies the continuity of the corresponding IDS. This gives an example of a discontinuous ""periodic"" IDS which is regularized by a random perturbation.","104"
"Actual organizations, in particular the ones which operate in evolving and distributed environments, need advanced frameworks for the management of the knowledge life cycle. These systems have to be based on the social relations which constitute the pattern of collaboration ties of the organization. We demonstrate here, with the aid of a model taken from the theory of graphs, that it is possible to provide the conditions for an effective knowledge management. A right way could be to involve the actors with the highest betweeness centrality in the generation of discussion groups. This solution allows the externalization of tacit knowledge, the preservation of knowledge and the raise of innovation processes.","120"
"We consider coupled quantum two-state systems qubits exposed to a global relaxation process. The global relaxation refers to the assumption that qubits are coupled to the same quantum bath with approximately equal strengths, appropriate for long-wavelength environmental fluctuations. We show that interactions do not spoil the picture of Dicke's subradiant and superradiant states where quantum interference effects lead to striking deviations from the independent relaxation picture. Remarkably, the system possess a stable entangled state and a state decaying faster than single qubit excitations. We propose a scheme how these effects can be experimentally accessed in superconducting flux qubits and, possibly, used in constructing long-lived entangled states.","116"
"We study, in the framework of open systems, the entanglement generation of two independent uniformly accelerated atoms in interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of massless scalar fields subjected to a reflecting plane boundary. We demonstrate that, with the presence of the boundary, the accelerated atoms exhibit distinct features from static ones in a thermal bath at the corresponding Unruh temperature in terms of the entanglement creation at the neighborhood of the initial time. In this sense, accelerated atoms in vacuum do not necessarily have to behave as if they were static in a thermal bath at the Unruh temperature.","107"
"We use geometric methods to calculate a formula for the complex Monge-Ampere measure ddcV_Kn, for K Subset RRn subset CCn a convex body and V_K its Siciak-Zaharjuta extremal function. Bedford and Taylor had computed this for symmetric convex bodies K. We apply this to show that two methods for deriving Bernstein-Markov-type inequalities, i.e., pointwise estimates of gradients of polynomials, yield the same results for all convex bodies. A key role is played by the geometric result that the extremal inscribed ellipses appearing in approximation theory are the maximal area ellipses determining the complex Monge-Ampere solution V_K.","103"
"We investigate the quantum Hall QH states near the charge neutral Dirac point of a high mobility graphene sample in high magnetic fields. We find that the QH states at filling factors nupm1 depend only on the perpendicular component of the field with respect to the graphene plane, indicating them to be not spin-related. A non-linear magnetic field dependence of the activation energy gap at filling factor nu1 suggests a many-body origin. We therefore propose that the nu0 and pm1 states arise from the lifting of the spin and sub-lattice degeneracy of the n0 LL, respectively.","102"
"The anticommuting properties of fermionic operators, together with the presence of parity conservation, affect the concept of entanglement in a composite fermionic system. Hence different points of view can give rise to different reasonable definitions of separable and entangled states. Here we analyze these possibilities and the relationship between the different classes of separable states. We illustrate the differences by providing a complete characterization of all the sets defined for systems of two fermionic modes. The results are applied to Gibbs states of infinite chains of fermions whose interaction corresponds to a XY-Hamiltonian with transverse magnetic field.","104"

The prospects offered by positron annihilation as a sensitive method to access nanocrystal NC properties are described and compared with other experimental methods. The tunability of the electronic structure of nanocrystals underlies their great potential for application in many areas. Owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio, the surfaces and interfaces of NCs play a crucial role in determining their properties. Here we focus on positron 2D angular correlation of annihilation radiation 2D-ACAR and two-detector Doppler studies for investigating surfaces and electronic properties of CdSe NCs.","105"

We focus on getting estimates for the Ginzburg-Landau energy with external magnetic field h_ex in certain interesting regimes of h_ex. This allows us to show that for configurations close to minimizers or local minimizers of the energy, the vorticity mass of the configuration u,A is comparable to the L2,infty Lorentz space norm of nabla_A u. We also establish convergence of the gauge-invariant Jacobians vorticity measures in the dual of a function space defined in terms of Lorentz spaces.","109"

By solving the conservation equations, we are able to write the stress-energy tensor in terms of a single unknown function of the radial co-ordinate, plus two arbitrary constants. Conditions for the stress-energy tensor to be regular at event horizons including the extremal and ultra-extremal'' cases are then derived using generalized Kruskal-like co-ordinates. These results should be useful for future calculations of the RSET for static quantum states on spherically symmetric black hole geometries in any number of space-time dimensions.","106"
"We apply the mathematical technique of factorization of differential operators to two different problems. First we review our results related to the supersymmetry of the Montroll kinks moving onto the microtubule walls as well as mentioning the sine-Gordon model for the microtubule nonlinear excitations. Second, we find analytic expressions for a class of one-parameter solutions of a sort of diffusion equation of Bessel type that is obtained by supersymmetry from the homogeneous form of a simple damped wave equations derived in the works of P.A. Robinson and collaborators for the corticothalamic system. We also present a possible interpretation of the diffusion equation in the brain context","111"
"This article provides a formalism making it possible to manage the solutions of the direct and inverse kinematic models of the fully parallel manipulators. We introduce the concept of working modes to separate the solutions from the opposite geometrical model. Then, we define, for each working mode, the aspects of these manipulators. To separate the solutions from the direct kinematics model, we introduce the concept of characteristic surfaces. Then, we define the uniqueness domains, as being the greatest domains of the workspace in which there is unicity of solutions. The principal applications of this work are the design, the trajectory planning.","114"
"A scenario combining a model of early TeV unification of quarks and leptons with the physics of large extra dimensions provides a natural mechanism linking quark and lepton masses at TeV scale. This has been dubbed as early quark-lepton mass unification by one of us PQH in one of the two models of early quark-lepton unification, which are consistent with data, namely SU4_PS otimes SU2_L otimes SU2_R otimes SU2_H. In particular, it focused on the issue of naturally light Dirac neutrino. The present paper will focus on similar issues in the other model, namely SU4_PS otimes SU3_L otimes SU3_H.","107"
"We consider the gravitino spectrum for the general warped solution in a specific six-dimensional gauged supergravity. We find that although the brane tensions introduced at the conical singularities break the bulk supersymmetry explicitly, massless modes of gravitino can exist with a nontrivial wave function profile, due to a nonzero U1_R gauge flux. We also compute the wave function and the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein massive modes of the gravitino explicitly. We show that the introduction of a gravitino mass term on a regularized brane can give a suppressed effective gravitino mass compared to the compactification scale, due to the delocalization of the wave function of the zero-mode gravitino.","115"
"In previous work, an ordering result was given for the symbolwise probability of error using general Markov channels, under iterative decoding of LDPC codes. In this paper, the ordering result is extended to mutual information, under the assumption of an iid input distribution. For certain channels, in which the capacity-achieving input distribution is iid, this allows ordering of the channels by capacity. The complexity of analyzing general Markov channels is mitigated by this ordering, since it is possible to immediately determine that a wide class of channels, with different numbers of states, has a smaller mutual information than a given channel.","114"
"We present a sl non--perturbative method, called sl Parametric Perturbation Theory PPT, which is alternative to the ordinary perturbation theory. The method relies on a principle of simplicity for the observable solutions, which are constrained to be linear in a certain unphysical parameter. The perturbative expansion is carried out in this parameter and not in the physical coupling as in ordinary perturbation theory. We show that the method is capable to resum the divergent perturbative series, to sl extract the leading asymptotic strong coupling behavior and sl predict with high accuracy the coefficients of the perturbative series.","107"
"We give a detailed discussion of the Quantum Interference Effect Transistor QuIET, a proposed device which exploits interference between electron paths through aromatic molecules to modulate current flow. In the off state, perfect destructive interference stemming from the molecular symmetry blocks current, while in the on state, current is allowed to flow by locally introducing either decoherence or elastic scattering. Details of a model calculation demonstrating the efficacy of the QuIET are presented, and various fabrication scenarios are proposed, including the possibility of using conducting polymers to connect the QuIET with multiple leads.","102"
"We cool the fundamental mode of a miniature cantilever by capacitively coupling it to a driven rf resonant circuit. Cooling results from the rf capacitive force, which is phase shifted relative to the cantilever motion. We demonstrate the technique by cooling a 7 kHz cantilever from room temperature to 45 K, obtaining reasonable agreement with a model for the cooling, damping, and frequency shift. Extending the method to higher frequencies in a cryogenic system could enable ground state cooling and may prove simpler than related optical experiments in a low temperature apparatus.","100"
"A bent crystal shield which is capable of deflecting cosmic radiation ions of all atomic numbers away from spacecraft using the ion channeling effect is described. Its effect on the transmitted angular distribution of heavy, high-energy ions is characterized using Monte Carlo channeling simulations. Ions up to an energy limit set by the bent crystal curvature radius are deflected by the full curvature angle. A bent crystal shield with a 1 x 1 cm2 surface area capable of deflecting such ions with energies up to 100 GeVnucleon is fabricated in which the lattice planes across the entrance surface are uniformly aligned.","106"
"A method based on Bayesian neural networks and genetic algorithm is proposed to control the fermentation process. The relationship between input and output variables is modelled using Bayesian neural network that is trained using hybrid Monte Carlo method. A feedback loop based on genetic algorithm is used to change input variables so that the output variables are as close to the desired target as possible without the loss of confidence level on the prediction that the neural network gives. The proposed procedure is found to reduce the distance between the desired target and measured outputs significantly.","100"
"The paper proposes a novel calibration approach for the Orthoglide-type mechanisms based on observations of the manipulator leg parallelism during motions between the prespecified test postures. It employs a low-cost measuring system composed of standard comparator indicators attached to the universal magnetic stands. They are sequentially used for measuring the deviation of the relevant leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian axes. Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the joint offsets that are treated as the most essential parameters to be adjusted. The sensitivity of the measurement methods and the calibration accuracy are also studied. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate validity of the proposed calibration technique.","120"

"The ground state of an externally confined one-component Yukawa plasma is derived analytically using the local density approximation LDA. In particular, the radial density profile is computed. The results are compared with the recently obtained mean-field MF density profile citehenning.pre06. While the MF results are more accurate for weak screening, LDA with correlations included yields the proper description for large screening. By comparison with first-principle simulations for three-dimensional spherical Yukawa crystals we demonstrate that both approximations complement each other. Together they accurately describe the density profile in the full range of screening parameters.","101"
"We develop a semi-classical field method for the study of the weakly interacting Bose gas at finite temperature, which, contrarily to the usual classical field model, does not suffer from an ultraviolet cut-off dependence. We apply the method to the study of thermal vortices in spatially homogeneous, two-dimensional systems. We present numerical results for the vortex density and the vortex pair distribution function. Insight in the physics of the system is obtained by comparing the numerical results with the predictions of simple analytical models. In particular, we calculate the activation energy required to form a vortex pair at low temperature.","110"
"A new formulation of field theory is presented, based on a pseudo-complex description. An extended group structure is introduced, implying a minimal scalar length, rendering the theory regularized a la Pauli-Villars. Cross sections are calculated for the scattering of an electron at an external Coulomb field and the Compton scattering. Deviations due to a smallest scalar length are determined. The theory also permits a modification of the minimal coupling scheme, resulting in a generalized dispersion relation. A shift of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin-limit GZK of the cosmic ray spectrum is the consequence.","100"
"The idea of symbolic controllers tries to bridge the gap between the top-down manual design of the controller architecture, as advocated in Brooks' subsumption architecture, and the bottom-up designer-free approach that is now standard within the Evolutionary Robotics community. The designer provides a set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in detail.","110"
"High frequency velocity oscillations were observed in the spectral lines Fe I 543.45nm and 543.29nm, using 2D spectroscopy with a Fabry- Perot and speckle reconstruction, at the VTT in Tenerife. We investigate the radial component of waves with frequencies in the range 8 - 22mHz in the internetwork, network and a pore. We find that the occurrence of waves do not show any preference on location and are equally distributed over down-flows and up-flows, regardless of the activity of the observed area in the line of Fe I 543.45nm. The waves observed in the lower formed line of Fe I 543.29nm seem to appear preferentially over down-flows.","115"
"A study of the measurement of the two photon decay width times the branching ratio of a Higgs boson with the mass of 120 GeV in photon - photon collisions is presented, assuming a gamma-gamma integrated luminosity of 80 fb-1 in the high energy part of the spectrum. The analysis is based on the reconstruction of the Higgs events produced in the gamma gamma -- H process, followed by the decay of the Higgs into a bbbar pair. A statistical error of the measurement of the two-photon width times the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decaying into b-quarks is found to be 2.1 for one year of data taking.","115"
"For any bounded regular domain Omega of a real analytic Riemannian manifold M, we denote by lambda_kOmega the k-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian of Omega. In this paper, we consider lambda_k and as a functional upon the set of domains of fixed volume in M. We introduce and investigate a natural notion of critical domain for this functional. In particular, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a domain to be critical, locally minimizing or locally maximizing for lambda_k. These results rely on Hadamard type variational formulae that we establish in this general setting.","103"
"Computer simulations were done of the mean square displacement MSD of tracer particles in colloidal gels formed by diffusion or reaction limited aggregation of hard spheres. The diffusion coefficient was found to be determined by the volume fraction accessible to the spherical tracers phi_a independent of the gel structure or the tracer size. In all cases, critical slowing down was observed at phi_aapprox 0.03 and was characterized by the same scaling laws reported earlier for tracer diffusion in a Lorentz gas. Strong heterogeneity of the MSD was observed at small phi_a and was related to the size distribution of pores.","105"
"The subject of this paper is a special class of parallel manipulators. First, we analyze a family of three-degree-of-freedom manipulators. Two Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ""inverse kinematics"" and the ""direct kinematics"" matrices. The singular configurations of these matrices are studied. The isotropic configurations are then studied based on the characteristic length of this manipulator. The isoconditioning loci of all Jacobian matrices are computed to define a global performance index to compare the different working modes.","101"
"Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms PKM are interesting alternative designs for machine tools. A design method based on velocity amplification factors analysis is presented in this paper. The comparative study of two simple two-degree-of-freedom PKM dedicated to machining applications is led through this method: the common desired properties are the largest square Cartesian workspace for given kinetostatic performances. The orientation and position of the Cartesian workspace are chosen to avoid singularities and to produce the best ratio between Cartesian workspace size and mechanism size. The machine size of each resulting design is used as a comparative criterion.","101"
"It is shown how to model weakly dissipative free-surface flows using the classical potential flow approach. The Helmholtz-Leray decomposition is applied to the linearized 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are treated using Fourier--Laplace transforms. We show how to express the vortical component of the velocity only in terms of the potential and free-surface elevation. A new predominant nonlocal viscous term is derived in the bottom kinematic boundary condition. The resulting formulation is simple and does not involve any correction procedure as in previous viscous potential flow theories Joseph2004. Corresponding long wave model equations are derived.","105"

The interesting features of the orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. Interval analysis based methods for computing the dextrous workspace and the largest cube enclosed in this workspace are presented.","101"
"Internet worms cause billions of dollars in damage yearly, affecting millions of users worldwide. For countermeasures to be deployed timeously, it is necessary to use an automated system to detect the spread of a worm. This paper discusses a method of determining the presence of a worm, based on routing information currently available from Internet routers. An autoencoder, which is a specialized type of neural network, was used to detect anomalies in normal routing behavior. The autoencoder was trained using information from a single router, and was able to detect both global instability caused by worms as well as localized routing instability.","113"

In particular the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm for constraint problems L-BFGS-B is used to minimize the distance between the numerical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation and the empirical probability density functions and thus to estimate properly the drift and diffusion term of the Fokker-Planck equation. The optimisation routine is applied to a time series of velocity measurements obtained from a turbulent helium gas jet in order to demonstrate the benefits and to quantify the improvements of this new optimisation routine.","100"
"Let dlap be the discrete Laplace operator acting on functions or rational matrices f:mathbfQ_LtomathbbQ, where mathbfQ_L is the two dimensional lattice of size L embedded in mathbbZ_2. Consider a rational Ltimes L matrix mathcalH, whose inner entries mathcalH_ij satisfy dlapmathcalH_ij0. The matrix mathcalH is thus the classical finite difference five-points approximation of the Laplace operator in two variables. We give a constructive proof that mathcalH is the restriction to mathbfQ_L of a discrete harmonic polynomial in two variables for any L2. This result proves a conjecture formulated in the context of deterministic fixed-energy sandpile models in statistical mechanics.","107"
"We develop a theory for pricing non-diversifiable mortality risk in an incomplete market. We do this by assuming that the company issuing a mortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We prove that our ensuing valuation formula satisfies a number of desirable properties. For example, we show that it is subadditive in the number of contracts sold. A key result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic, then the risk-adjusted survival probability is greater than the physical survival probability, even as the number of contracts approaches infinity.","105"
"We show that there is a link between the Kuramoto paradigm and another system of synchronized oscillators, namely an electrical power distribution grid of generators and consumers. The purpose of this work is to show both the formal analogy and some practical consequences. The mapping can be made quantitative, and under some necessary approximations a class of Kuramoto-like models, those with bimodal distribution of the frequencies, is most appropriate for the power-grid. In fact in the power-grid there are two kinds of oscillators: the 'sources' delivering power to the 'consumers'.","101"

In particular, the influence of spatial inhomogeneities on local tidal accelerations is investigated. The implications of our results for the dynamics of the solar system are briefly discussed. That is, on the basis of the models studied in this paper, we estimate the tidal influence of the cosmic gravitational field on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and show that the corresponding temporal rate of variation of the astronomical unit is negligibly small.","103"
"Here we present experimental and computational evidences to support that rock-salt cubic VO is a strongly correlated metal with Non-Fermi-Liquid thermodynamics and an unusually strong spin-lattice coupling. An unexpected change of sign of metallic thermopower with composition is tentatively ascribed to the presence of a pseudogap in the density of states. These properties are discussed as signatures of the proximity to a magnetic quantum phase transition. The results are summarized in a new electronic phase diagram for the 3d monoxides, which resembles that of other strongly correlated systems. The structural and electronic simplicity of 3d monoxides make them ideal candidates to progress in the understanding of highly correlated electron systems.","116"
"Mutant knots, in the sense of Conway, are known to share the same Homfly polynomial. Their 2-string satellites also share the same Homfly polynomial, but in general their m-string satellites can have different Homfly polynomials for m2. We show that, under conditions of extra symmetry on the constituent 2-tangles, the directed m-string satellites of mutants share the same Homfly polynomial for m6 in general, and for all choices of m when the satellite is based on a cable knot pattern. We give examples of mutants with extra symmetry whose Homfly polynomials of some 6-string satellites are different, by comparing their quantum sl3 invariants.","114"
"The Zernike radial polynomials are a system of orthogonal polynomials over the unit interval with weight x. They are used as basis functions in optics to expand fields over the cross section of circular pupils. To calculate the roots of Zernike polynomials, we optimize the generic iterative numerical Newton's Method that iterates on zeros of functions with third order convergence. The technique is based on rewriting the polynomials as Gauss hypergeometric functions, reduction of second order derivatives to first order derivatives, and evaluation of some ratios of derivatives by terminating continued fractions. A PARI program and a short table of zeros complete up to polynomials of 20th order are included.","119"
"We derive four-dimensional 4D effective theories of the gauge-Higgs unification models in the warped spacetime. The effective action can be expressed in a simple form by neglecting subleading corrections to the wave functions. We have shown in our previous works that some Higgs couplings to the other fields are suppressed by factors that depend on bartheta_H from the values in the standard model. Here bartheta_H is the Wilson line phase along the fifth dimension, which characterizes the electroweak symmetry breaking. The effective action derived here explicitly shows a nonlinear structure of the Higgs sector, which clarifies the origins of those suppression factors.","109"

"Recycled dwarf galaxies can form in the collisional debris of massive galaxies. Theoretical models predict that, contrary to classical galaxies, they should be free of non-baryonic Dark Matter. Analyzing the observed gas kinematics of such recycled galaxies with the help of a numerical model, we demonstrate that they do contain a massive dark component amounting to about twice the visible matter. Staying within the standard cosmological framework, this result most likely indicates the presence of large amounts of unseen, presumably cold, molecular gas. This additional mass should be present in the disks of their progenitor spiral galaxies, accounting for a significant part of the so-called missing baryons.","119"
"We test the validity of the QCD sum rules applied to the light scalar mesons, the charmed mesons D_s02317 and D_s1 2460, and the X3872 axial meson, considered as tetraquark states. We find that, with the studied currents, it is possible to find an acceptable Borel window only for the X3872 meson. In such a Borel window we have simultaneouly a good OPE convergence and a pole contribution which is bigger than the continuum contribution. We interpret these results as a strong argument against the assignment of a tetraquark structure for the light scalars and the D_s02317 and D_s1 2460 mesons.","110"
"We have developed an image restoration technique based on the Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for GLAST-LAT image analysis. Our algorithm is original since it utilizes the PSF point spread function that is calculated for each event. This is critical for EGRET and GLAST-LAT image analysis since the PSF depends on the energy and angle of incident gamma-rays and varies by more than one order of magnitude. EGRET and GLAST-LAT image analysis also faces Poisson noise due to low photon statistics. Our technique incorporates wavelet filtering to minimize noise effects. We present studies of EGRET sources using this novel image restoration technique for possible identification of extended gamma-ray sources.","113"
"If the two lightest neutralinos of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model have a mass splitting less than the Z boson mass, interference effects in the three-body decay chi_20 -- chi_10 f f can be important. We formulate an observable that contains information on the nature of the interference: the ratio BRchi_20 -- chi_10 b b  BRchi_20 -- chi_10 l l-. This will give a constraint on the supersymmetry breaking parameters that is complementary to many techniques already existing in the literature. We present some ideas on how to perform a simple counting experiment to determine this ratio.","103"
"Universe evolution, as described by Friedmann's equations, is determined by source terms fixed by the choice of pressure times energy-density equations of state prho. The usual approach in Cosmology considers equations of state accounting only for kinematic terms, ignoring the contribution from the interactions between the particles constituting the source fluid. In this work the importance of these neglected terms is emphasized. A systematic method, based on the Statistical Mechanics of real fluids, is proposed to include them. A toy-model is presented which shows how such interaction terms can engender significant cosmological effects.","104"
"The high-Q harmonic oscillator mode of a Josephson junction can be used as a novel probe of spurious two-level systems TLSs inside the amorphous oxide tunnel barriers of the junction. In particular, we show that spectroscopic transmission measurements of the junction resonator mode can reveal how the coupling magnitude between the junction and the TLSs varies with an external magnetic field applied in the plane of the tunnel barrier. The proposed experiments offer the possibility of clearly resolving the underlying coupling mechanism for these spurious TLSs, an important decoherence source limiting the quality of superconducting quantum devices.","102"
"Zero-field muon-spin-relaxation ZF-boldmath muSR measurements were carried out down to 80 mK on the randomness bond system Tl_1-xK_xCuCl_3 with x  0.44. Time spectra are well fitted by the stretched exponential function exp -lambda tbeta. The muon spin relaxation rate lambda increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, and beta tends to 0.5 at 80 mK. The divergent increase of lambda suggests the critical slowing down of the frequency of the Cu-3it d spin fluctuations toward a spin frozen state below 80 mK, and the root-exponential-like behavior of the time spectrum indicates that the origin of the relaxation is possibly the spatially-fixed fluctuating dilute moments.","108"
"The subject of this paper is the design of a new concept of modular parallel mechanisms for three, four or five-axis machining applications. Most parallel mechanisms are designed for three- or six-axis machining applications.

The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom dof for translation motions and to add one or two legs to add one or two-dofs for rotation motions. The kinematics and singular configurations are studied for each mechanism.","106"
"Reversible diffusion limited cluster aggregation of hard spheres with rigid bonds was simulated and the self diffusion coefficient was determined for equilibrated systems. The effect of increasing attraction strength was determined for systems at different volume fractions and different interaction ranges. It was found that the slowing down of the diffusion coefficient due to crowding is decoupled from that due to cluster formation. The diffusion coefficient could be calculated from the cluster size distribution and became zero only at infinite attraction strength when permanent gels are formed. It is concluded that so-called attractive glasses are not formed at finite interaction strength.","106"
"We study the spin-orbit splitting ls-splitting for the proton d-orbits in 23F in the Hartree-Fock framework with the tensor force in the exchange channel. 23F has one more proton around the neutron-rich nucleus 22O. A recent experiment indicates that the ls-splitting for the proton d-orbits in 23F is reduced from that in 17F. Our calculation shows that the ls-splitting in 23F becomes smaller by about a few MeV due to the tensor force. This effect comes from the interaction between the valence proton and the occupied neutrons in the 0d52 orbit through the tensor force and makes the ls-splitting in 23F close to the experimental data.","111"
"Starting from a model that consists of a semiclassical spin coupled to two leads we present a microscopic derivation of the Langevin equation for the direction of the spin. For slowly-changing direction it takes on the form of the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation. We give expressions for the Gilbert damping parameter and the strength of the fluctuations, including their bias-voltage dependence. At nonzero bias-voltage the fluctuations and damping are not related by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We find, however, that in the low-frequency limit it is possible to introduce a voltage-dependent effective temperature that characterizes the fluctuations in the direction of the spin, and its transport-steady-state probability distribution function.","116"

Those results give a complete description of arrangements with geometric lattice and with the codimension condition on the subspaces such that MA is rationally elliptic, and show that most arrangements have an hyperbolic complement.","117"

In both cases, we determine the horoboundary and say which points are Busemann points, that is the limits of geodesic rays. In the case of the dual generators, it turns out that all boundary points are Busemann points, but this is not true for the Artin generators. We also characterise the geodesics with respect to the dual generators, which allows us to calculate the associated geodesic growth series.","104"

"Rotation-induced splitting of the otherwise degenerate photonic bands is predicted for a two-dimensional photonic crystal made of evanescently coupled microcavities. The symmetry-broken energy splitting is similar to the Zeeman splitting of atomic levels or electron's hole's magnetic moment sublevels in an external magnetic field. The orbital motion of photons in periodic photonic lattice of microcavities is shown to enhance significantly such Coriolis-Zeeman splitting as compared to a solitary microcavity D.L. Boiko, Optics Express 2, 397 1998. The equation of motion suggests that nonstationary rotation induces quantum transitions between photonic states and, furthermore, that such transitions will serve as a source of nonstationary gravitational field.","115"
"We consider globally regular and black hole solutions in SU2 Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, coupled to a dilaton field. The basic solutions represent magnetic monopoles, monopole-antimonopole systems or black holes with monopole or dipole hair. When the globally regular solutions carry additionally electric charge, an angular momentum density results, except in the simplest spherically symmetric case. We evaluate the global charges of the solutions and their effective action, and analyze their dependence on the gravitational coupling strength. We show, that in the presence of a dilaton field, the black hole solutions satisfy a generalized Smarr type mass formula.","108"
"We study the thermodynamics of the hard wall model, which consists in the introduction of an infrared cut-off in asymptotically AdS spaces. This is a toy model for confining backgrounds in the context of the gaugegravity correspondence. We use holographic renormalization and reproduce the existence of a Hawking Page phase transition recently discussed by Herzog. We also show that the entropy jumps from N0 to N2, which reinforces the interpretation of this transition as the gravity dual of confinementdeconfinement. We also show that similar results hold for the phenomenologically motivated soft wall model, underlining the potential universality of our analysis.","108"
"We present a systematic semiclassical procedure to compute the partition function for scalar field theories at finite temperature. The central objects in our scheme are the solutions of the classical equations of motion in imaginary time, with spatially independent boundary conditions. Field fluctuations -- both field deviations around these classical solutions, and fluctuations of the boundary value of the fields -- are resummed in a Gaussian approximation. In our final expression for the partition function, this resummation is reduced to solving certain ordinary differential equations. Moreover, we show that it is renormalizable with the usual 1-loop counterterms.","106"
"We discuss the problem of designing an unambiguous programmable discriminator for mixed quantum states. We prove that there does not exist such a universal unambiguous programmable discriminator for mixed quantum states that has two program registers and one data register. However, we find that we can use the idea of programmable discriminator to unambiguously discriminate mixed quantum states. The research shows that by using such an idea, when the success probability for discrimination reaches the upper bound, the success probability is better than what we do not use the idea to do, except for some special cases.","105"
"In this paper we investigate non-central elements of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group whose squares are central. In particular, we describe a commutative subalgebra generated by certain non-central square roots of central elements, and the generic existence of a rank-three submodule of the Hecke algebra contained in the square root of the centre but not in the centre. The generators for this commutative subalgebra include the longest word and elements related to trivial and sign characters of the Hecke algebra. We find elegant expressions for the squares of such generators in terms of both the minimal basis of the centre and the elementary symmetric functions of Murphy elements.","116"
"The first order perturbations of the energy levels of a stationary hydrogen atom in static external gravitational field, with Schwarzschild metric, are investigated. The energy shifts are calculated for the relativistic 1S, 2S, 2P, 3S, 3P, 3D, 4S, 4P, 4D and 4F levels. The results show that the energy-level shifts of the states with total angular momentum quantum number 12 are all zero, and the ratio of absolute energy shifts with total angular momentum quantum number 52 is 1:4:5. This feature can be used to help us to distinguish the gravitational effect from other effect.","110"
"Chirally odd generalized parton distributions GPDs and the Boer-Mulders function provide valuable information about spin-orbit correlations for quarks in nucleons and other hadrons. We compare results for the relevant GPD barEq_T from a variety of phenomenological models as well as recent lattice results. We find that barEq_T0 for nucleons as well as the pion and for both u and d quark. As a result, the corresponding Boer Mulders functions are all expected to be negative. The sign of barEq_T arises from the relative sign between the upper and lower Dirac components for the quark wave functions.","102"
"A formalism for quantum error correction based on operator algebras was introduced in 1 via consideration of the Heisenberg picture for quantum dynamics. The resulting theory allows for the correction of hybrid quantum-classical information and does not require an encoded state to be entirely in one of the corresponding subspaces or subsystems. Here, we provide detailed proofs for the results of 1, derive a number of new results, and we elucidate key points with expanded discussions. We also present several examples and indicate how the theory can be extended to operator spaces and general positive operator-valued measures.","104"
"Let pi be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_4 with central character mu2. It is known that pi has Shalika period with respect to mu if and only if the L-function LSs, pi, bigwedge2otimesmu-1 has a pole at s1. Recentlt, Jacquet and Martin considered the analogous question for cuspidal representations pi_D of the inner form GL_2DA, and obtained a partial result via the relative trace formula. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem via the method of theta correspondence, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Shalika period for pi_D. We also resolve the analogous question in the local setting.","118"
"We investigate the integer quantum Hall system in a two dimensional lattice model with spatially correlated disorder by using the efficient method to calculate the Chern number proposed by Fukui textitet al. Distribution of charge density indicates that the extended states at the center of each Landau band have percolating current paths, which are topologically equivalent to the edge states that exist in a system with boundaries. As increasing the strength of disorder, floating feature is observed in an averaged Hall conductance as a function of filling factor. Its relation to the observed experiments is also discussed.","103"
"We describe a recursive algorithm that produces an integral basis for the centre of the Hecke algebra of type A consisting of linear combinations of monomial symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements. We also discuss the existence of integral bases for the centre of the Hecke algebra that consist solely of monomial symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements. Finally, for n3, we show that only one such basis exists for the centre of the Hecke algebra, by proving that there are exactly four bases for the centre of the corresponding symmetric group algebra which consist solely of monomial symmetric polynomials of Jucys--Murphy elements.","113"
"Using a novel, string theory-inspired formalism based on a Hamiltonian constraint, we obtain a conformal mechanical system for the spatially flat four-dimensional Robertson-Walker Universe. Depending on parameter choices, this system describes either a relativistic particle in the Robertson-Walker background, or metric fluctuations of the Robertson-Walker geometry. Moreover we derive a tree-level M-theory matrix model in this time-dependent background. Imposing the Hamiltonian constraint forces the spacetime geometry to be fuzzy near the big bang, while the classical Robertson-Walker geometry emerges as the Universe expands. From our approach we also derive the temperature of the Universe interpolating between the radiation and matter dominated eras.","112"
"The ratio of transverse momentum distribution of thermal photons to dilepton has been evaluated. It is observed that this ratio reaches a plateau beyond a certain value of transverse momentum. We argue that this ratio can be used to estimate the initial temperature of the system by selecting the transverse momentum and invariance mass windows judiciously. It is demonstrated that if the radial flow is large then the plateau disappear and hence a deviation from the plateau can be used as an indicator of large radial flow. The sensitivity of the results on various input parameters has been studied.","104"
"This article considers the application of particle filtering to continuous-discrete optimal filtering problems, where the system model is a stochastic differential equation, and noisy measurements of the system are obtained at discrete instances of time. It is shown how the Girsanov theorem can be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling. It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models, where the driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and thus the laws of state and noise are not absolutely continuous. Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally Gaussian models and unknown static parameter models is also considered.","114"
"We investigate low-temperature transport properties of thin TiN superconducting films in the vicinity of the disorder-driven superconductor-insulator transition. In a zero magnetic field, we find an extremely sharp separation between superconducting and insulating phases, evidencing a direct superconductor-insulator transition without an intermediate metallic phase. At moderate temperatures, in the insulating films we reveal thermally activated conductivity with the magnetic field-dependent activation energy. At very low temperatures, we observe a zero-conductivity state, which is destroyed at some depinning threshold voltage V_T. These findings indicate formation of a distinct collective state of the localized Cooper pairs in the critical region at both sides of the transition.","114"
"The self-propelled motion of microscopic bodies immersed in a fluid medium is studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The advantage of the atomistic approach is that the detailed level of description allows complete freedom in specifying the swimmer design and its coupling with the surrounding fluid. A series of two-dimensional swimming bodies employing a variety of propulsion mechanisms -- motivated by biological and microrobotic designs -- is investigated, including the use of moving limbs, changing body shapes and fluid jets. The swimming efficiency and the nature of the induced, time-dependent flow fields are found to differ widely among body designs and propulsion mechanisms.","109"
"Extending our results in ""Entropy conjecture for continuous maps of nilmanifolds"", to appear in Israel Jour. of Math., we confirm that Entropy Conjecture holds for every continuous self-map of a compact Kpi,1 manifold with the fundamental group pi torsion free and virtually nilpotent, in particular for every continuous map of an infra-nilmanifold. In fact we prove a stronger version, a lower estimate of the topological entropy of a map by logarithm of the spectral radius of an associated ""linearization matrix"" with integer entries. From this, referring to known estimates of Mahler measure of polynomials, we deduce some absolute lower bounds for the entropy.","117"
"We analyze the BOOMERanG 2003 B03 145 GHz temperature map to constrain the amplitude of a non Gaussian, primordial contribution to CMB fluctuations. We perform a pixel space analysis restricted to a portion of the map chosen in view of high sensitivity, very low foreground contamination and tight control of systematic effects. We set up an estimator based on the three Minkowski functionals which relies on high quality simulated data, including non Gaussian CMB maps. We find good agreement with the Gaussian hypothesis and derive the first limits based on BOOMERanG data for the non linear coupling parameter f_NL as -300f_NL650 at 68 CL and -800f_NL1050 at 95 CL.","116"
"With the great success in simulating many intelligent behaviors using computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines, the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element. The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a classical case is also discussed.","105"
"By applying the idea of parafermionic clustering to composite bosons with positive as well as negative flux, a new series of trial wavefunctions to describe fractional quantum Hall states is proposed. These non-Abelian states compete at filling factors k3k - 2 with other ground states like stripes or composite fermion states. These two series contain all the states recently discovered by Pan et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 016801 2003 including the even denominator cases. Exact diagonalization studies on the sphere and torus point to their possible relevance for filling factors 37, 311, and 38.","107"
"Phases of the spherical harmonic analysis of full-sky cosmic microwave background CMB temperature data contain useful information complementary to the ubiquitous angular power spectrum. In this letter we present a new method of phase analysis on incomplete sky maps. It is based on Fourier phases of equal-latitude pixel rings of the map, which are related to the mean angle of the trigonometric moments from the full-sky phases. They have an advantage for probing regions of interest without tapping polluted Galactic plane area, and can localize non-Gaussian features and departure from statistical isotropy in the CMB.","101"
"A spectral analysis of the nearby isolated neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 is presented. Applying the kinetic approach, the distribution functions of emitting electrons are derived and the entire spectra is fitted. It is found that waves excited by the cyclotron mechanism, come in the radio domain. We confirm that the cyclotron instability is quite efficient, since the estimations show that the time of wave-particle interaction is long enough for particles to acquire perpendicular momentum and generate observed radiation. The lack of rotational modulation is discussed and the pulsar spin period is estimated.","100"
"The non-relativistic G_0 G formalism of BCS-BEC crossover at finite temperature is extended to relativistic fermion systems. The uncondensed pairs contribute a pseudogap to the fermion excitations. The theory recovers the BCS mean field approximation at zero temperature and the non-relativistic results in a proper limit. For massive fermions, when the coupling strength increases, there exist two crossovers from the weak coupling BCS superfluid to the non-relativistic BEC state and then to the relativistic BEC state. For color superconductivity at moderate baryon density, the matter is in the BCS-BEC crossover region, and the behavior of the pseudogap is quite similar to that found in high temperature superconductors.","116"
"A pronounced step-like kink behavior in the temperature dependence of resistivity rho T is observed in the optimally-doped Sm_1.85Ce_0.15CuO_4 thin films around T_sf87K and attributed to manifestation of strong spin fluctuations induced by Sm3 moments with the energy hbar omega_sfk_BT_sfsimeq 7meV. In addition to fluctuation induced contribution rho_sfT due to thermal broadening effects of the width omega_sf, the experimental data are found to be well fitted accounting for residual zero-temperature rho_res, electron-phonon rho _e-phTAT and electron-electron rho_e-eTBT2 contributions. The best fits produced omega_p2.1meV, tau_0-19.5times 10-14s-1, lambda 1.2, and E_F0.2eV for estimates of the plasmon frequency, the impurity scattering rate, electron-phonon coupling constant, and the Fermi energy, respectively.","119"
"The article is dedicated to q-deformed versions of spinor calculus. As a kind of review, the most relevant properties of the two-dimensional quantum plane are summarized. Additionally, the relationship between the quantum plane and higher-dimensional quantum spaces like the q-deformed Euclidean space in four dimensions or the q-deformed Minkowski space is outlined. These considerations are continued by introducing q-analogs of the Pauli matrices. Their main properties are discussed in detail and numerous relations that could prove useful in physical applications are presented. In this respect, q-deformed versions of the important Fierz identities are written down.","104"
"We investigated the switching dynamics of two kinds of EuBa2Cu3Oy Eu123 intrinsic Josephson junctions IJJs with different anisotropy parameters gamma  mcmab12 tuned to 37 and 22. In contrast to weakly-coupled IJJs in Bi2212, significant deviations from the thermally activated escape model of a single-stack Josephson junction were observed in their switching current distributions, PI, due to the strongly-coupled nature of the Eu123 IJJs, The PI of the two IJJs are found to be independent of temperature, below 1.4 K and 4.2 K, respectively; which indicates the observation of macroscopic quantum tunneling at high temperatures of liquid He.","106"
"Suppose mu_TDelta is a point of the universal Teichm""uller space TDelta. In 1998, it was shown by Bovzin et al. that there exists mu such that mu has non-constant modulus and is uniquely extremal in mu_TDelta. It is a natural problem whether there is always an extremal Beltrmai coefficient of constant modulus in mu_TDelta if mu_TDelta admits more than one extremal Beltrami coefficient. The purpose of this paper is to show that the answer is negative. An infinitesimal version is also obtained. Extremal sets of extremal Beltrami coefficients are considered and an open problem is proposed.","106"
"We consider discrete nonlinear hyperbolic equations on quad-graphs, in particular on the square lattice. The fields are associated to the vertices and an equation Qx_1,x_2,x_3,x_40 relates four fields at one quad. Integrability of equations is understood as 3D-consistency. The latter is a possibility to consistently impose equations of the same type on all the faces of a three-dimensional cube. This allows to set these equations also on multidimensional lattices ZN. We classify integrable equations with complex fields x, and Q affine-linear with respect to all arguments. The method is based on analysis of singular solutions.","110"
"We construct a phenomenological three-nucleon force 3NF model that gives a good description of polarization observables in elastic nucleon-deuteron N-d scattering at a low energy together with a realistic nucleon-nucleon force and a 3NF arising from the exchange of two pions. Parameters of the model, which consists of spin-independent, spin-orbit, and tensor components, are determined to reproduce the three-nucleon binding energy and polarization observables in N-d scattering at 3 MeV. Predictions of the model 3NF on N-d polarization observables at higher energies are examined, and effects of each component on the observables are investigated.","102"
"We present a method of using a nuclear magnetic resonance computer to solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem in which: 1 the number of molecules in the NMR sample is irrelevant to the number of qubits available to an NMR quantum computer, and 2 the initial state is chosen to be the state of thermal equilibrium, thereby avoiding the preparation of pseudopure states and the resulting exponential loss of signal as the number of qubits increases. The algorithm is described along with its experimental implementation using four active qubits. As expected, measured spectra demonstrate a clear distinction between constant and balanced functions.","107"
"Extracting understanding from the growing sea'' of biological and socio-economic data is one of the most pressing scientific challenges facing us. Here, we introduce and validate an unsupervised method that is able to accurately extract the hierarchical organization of complex biological, social, and technological networks. We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested random graphs, which we use to validate the method. We then apply our method to real-world networks, including the air-transportation network, an electronic circuit, an email exchange network, and metabolic networks. We find that our method enables us to obtain an accurate multi-scale descriptions of a complex system.","114"

"The system created in non-central relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions possesses large orbital angular momentum. Due to spin-orbit coupling, particles produced in such a system could become globally polarized along the direction of the system angular momentum. We present the results of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperon global polarization measurements in AuAu collisions at sqrts_NN62.4 GeV and 200 GeV performed with the STAR detector at RHIC. The observed global polarization of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons in the STAR acceptance is consistent with zero within the precision of the measurements. The obtained upper limit, P_Lambda,anti-Lambda  0.02, is compared to the theoretical values discussed recently in the literature.","113"
"In this paper we build on the framework developed in ""Subelliptic Boundary Value Problems for the Spin_C Dirac Operator, I, II, III"" to obtain a more complete understanding of the gluing properties for indices of boundary value problems for the SpinC-Dirac operator with sub-elliptic boundary conditions. We extend our analytic results for sub-elliptic boundary value problems for the SpinC-Dirac operator, and gluing results for the indices of these boundary problems to SpinC-manifolds with several pseudoconvex pseudoconcave boundary components. These results are applied to study Stein fillability for compact, 3-dimensional, contact manifolds.","102"
"High energy heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC produce a novel medium characterized by an initial energy density over an order of magnitude above the expected phase transformation value and that then evolves as a nearly inviscid liquid. Probing the medium with auto-generated particles is a key methodology to quantitatively determine the medium properties. Pairs of heavy quarks are an excellent probe since their spatial separation to form various quarkonia states spans the relevant range of color screening lengths in the medium. In this proceedings, we describe results from the PHENIX experiment on Jpsi production and discuss initial physics implications of the measurements.","112"
"We derive the evolution of a hadronic light cone wave function with energy at weak coupling. Our derivation is valid both in the high and the low partonic density limit, and thus encompasses both the JIMWLK and the KLWMIJ evolution. The hadronic wave function is shown to evolve by the action of the Bogoliubov-type operator, which diagonalizes on the soft gluon sector the light-cone hamiltonian in the presence of an arbitrary valence charge density. We find explicitly the action of this operator on the soft as well as the valence degrees of freedom of the theory.","102"
"We give an explicit expression for the frequencies of slowly damped quasinormal modes of near-extreme Kerr black holes. It follows from this expression that the near-extreme Kerr holes obey the Hod's bound: in the limit of maximal rotation, lim sup omega_ISTleq pi  hbar, where omega _IS is the decay rate of the slowest decaying quasinormal mode, T is the black hole temperature. On the other hand, the bound is not saturated in the sense that lim inf omega_IST pi hbar is a strict inequality. it It remains unclear whether the bound is saturated in the sense that lim sup omega_IST pi hbar.","112"
"We study the behavior of the two-dimensional two-component plasma in the presence of some adsorbing impurities. Using a solvable model, we find analytic expressions for the thermodynamic properties of the plasma such as the n-body densities, the grand potential, and the pressure. We specialize in the case where there are one or two adsorbing point impurities in the plasma, and in the case where there are one or two parallel adsorbing lines. In the former case we study the effective interaction between the impurities, due to the charge redistribution around them. The latter case is a model for electrodes with adsorbing sticky sites on their surface.","116"
"We report a molecular dynamics simulation of melting of tungsten W nanoparticles. The modified embedded atom method MEAM interatomic potentials are used to describe the interaction between tungsten atoms. The melting temperature of unsupported tungsten nanoparticles of different sizes are found to decrease as the size of the particles decreases. The melting temperature obtained in the present study is approximately a decreasing function of inverse radius, in a good agreement with the predictions of thermodynamic models. We also observed that the melting of a W nanoparticle is preceded by the premelting of its outer skin at a temperature lower than its melting temperature.","109"
"We propose a theoretical scheme for secure quantum key distribution network following the ideas in quantum dense coding. In this scheme, the server of the network provides the service for preparing and measuring the Bell states, and the users encodes the states with local unitary operations. For preventing the server from eavesdropping, we design a decoy when the particle is transmitted between the users. It has high capacity as one particle carries two bits of information and its efficiency for qubits approaches 100. Moreover, it is not necessary for the users to store the quantum states, which makes this scheme more convenient for application than others.","116"

In addition, the author gives a nontrivial lower bound 1.0004609ln n of performance guarantee of this algorithm. This lower bound, together with the matching bound of information content heuristic, confirms the fact information content heuristic is slightly better than setcover greedy algorithm in worst case.","102"
"Nonlinear effects in mesoscopic devices can have both quantum and classical origins. We show that a three-Josephson-junction 3JJ flux qubit in the _classical_ regime can produce low-frequency oscillations in the presence of an external field in resonance with the high-frequency harmonic mode of the system, omega. Like in the case of_quantum_ Rabi oscillations, the frequency of these pseudo-Rabi oscillations is much smaller than omega and scales approximately linearly with the amplitude of the external field. This classical effect can be reliably distinguished from its quantum counterpart because it can be produced by the external perturbation not only at the resonance frequency omega and its subharmonics omegan, but also at its overtones, nomega.","120"
"We compute the initial energy density and net baryon number density in 5 most central PbPb collisions at sqrt s5.5 TeV from pQCD  final state saturation, and describe the evolution of the produced system with boost-invariant transversely expanding hydrodynamics. In addition to the total multiplicity at midrapidity, we give predictions for the multiplicity of charged hadrons, pions, kaons and antiprotons, for the total transverse energy and net-baryon number, as well as for the p_T-spectrum of charged hadrons, pions and kaons. We also predict the region of applicability of hydrodynamics by comparing these results with high-p_T hadron spectra computed from pQCD and energy losses.","113"
"We consider estimation procedures which are recursive in the sense that each successive estimator is obtained from the previous one by a simple adjustment. The model considered in the paper is very general as we do not impose any preliminary restrictions on the probabilistic nature of the observation process and cover a wide class of nonlinear recursive procedures. In this paper we study asymptotic behaviour of the recursive estimators. The results of the paper can be used to determine the form of a recursive procedure which is expected to have the same asymptotic properties as the corresponding non-recursive one defined as a solution of the corresponding estimating equation.","112"
"We perform an amplitude analysis of B- - phi1020 K892- decay with a sample of about 384 million BBbar pairs recorded with the BABAR detector. Overall, twelve parameters are measured, including the fractions of longitudinal f_L and parity-odd transverse f_perp amplitudes, branching fraction, strong phases, and six parameters sensitive to CP-violation. We use the dependence on the Kpi invariant mass of the interference between the JP1- and 0 Kpi components to resolve the discrete ambiguity in the determination of the strong and weak phases. Our measurements of f_L0.49-0.05-0.03, f_perp0.21-0.05-0.02, and the strong phases point to the presence of a substantial helicity-plus amplitude from a presently unknown source.","118"
"We introduce the Cauchy augmentation operator for basic hypergeometric series. Heine's _2phi_1 transformation formula and Sears' _3phi_2 transformation formula can be easily obtained by the symmetric property of some parameters in operator identities. The Cauchy operator involves two parameters, and it can be considered as a generalization of the operator TbD_q. Using this operator, we obtain extensions of the Askey-Wilson integral, the Askey-Roy integral, Sears' two-term summation formula, as well as the q-analogues of Barnes' lemmas. Finally, we find that the Cauchy operator is also suitable for the study of the bivariate Rogers-Szeg""o polynomials, or the continuous big q-Hermite polynomials.","118"
"In a recent Letter, Bergsten and co-authors have studied the resistance oscillations with gate voltage and magnetic field in arrays of semiconductor rings and interpreted the oscillatory magnetic field dependence as Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak AAS oscillations and oscillatory dependence on gate voltage as the Aharonov-Casher AC effect. This Comment shows that Bergsten and co-authors incorrectly identified AAS effect as a source of resistance oscillations in magnetic field, that spin relaxation in their experimental setting is strong enough to destroy oscillatory effects of spin origin, and that the oscillations are caused by changes in carrier density and the Fermi energy by gate, and are unrelated to spin.","110"
"In this paper, we establish the existence of periodic orbits of a twisted geodesic flow on all low energy levels and in all dimensions whenever the magnetic field form is symplectic and spherically rational. This is a consequence of a more general theorem concerning periodic orbits of autonomous Hamiltonian flows near Morse-Bott non-degenerate, symplectic extrema. Namely, we show that all energy levels near such extrema carry periodic orbits, provided that the ambient manifold meets certain topological requirements. This result is a partial generalization of the Weinstein-Moser theorem. The proof of the generalized Weinstein-Moser theorem is a combination of a Sturm-theoretic argument and a Floer homology calculation.","115"
"In the dense-neutrino region above the neutrino sphere of a supernova r  400 km, neutrino-neutrino refraction causes collective flavor transformations. They can lead to ""spectral splits"" where an energy E_split splits the transformed spectrum sharply into parts of almost pure but different flavors. Unless there is an ordinary MSW resonance in the dense-neutrino region, E_split is determined by flavor-lepton number conservation alone. Spectral splits are created by an adiabatic transition between regions of large and small neutrino density. We solve the equations of motion in the adiabatic limit explicitly and provide analytic expressions for a generic example.","106"
"Large dimensionless numbers, arising out of ratios of various physical constants, intrigued many scientists, especially Dirac. Relying on the coincidence of large numbers, Dirac arrived at the revolutionary hypothesis that the gravitational constant G should vary inversely as the cosmic time t. This hypothesis of Dirac, known as Large Number Hypothesis LNH, sparked off many speculations, arguments and new ideas in terms of applications. Works done by several authors with LNH as their basic platform are reviewed in this work. Relationship between some of those works are pointed out here. Possibility of time-variations of physical constants other than G are also discussed.","114"
"The orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field introduces asymmetries in the heliosphere that affect the location of heliospheric radio emissions and the streaming direction of ions from the termination shock of the solar wind. We combine observations of radio emissions and energetic particle streaming with extensive 3D MHD computer simulations of magnetic field draping over the heliopause to show that the plane of the local interstellar field is  60-90 degrees from the galactic plane. This suggests that the field orientation in the Local Interstellar Cloud differs from that of a larger scale interstellar magnetic field thought to parallel the galactic plane.","105"
"At very high energies we expect that the hadronic cross sections satisfy the Froissart bound, which is a well-established property of the strong interactions. In this energy regime we also expect the formation of the Color Glass Condensate, characterized by gluon saturation and a typical momentum scale: the saturation scale Q_s. In this paper we show that if a saturation window exists between the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes of Quantum Chromodynamics QCD, the total cross sections satisfy the Froissart bound. Furthermore, we show that our approach allows us to describe the high energy experimental data on pppbarp total cross sections.","109"
"A first-order theory has the Schroder-Bernstein property if any two of its models that are elementarily bi-embeddable are isomorphic. We prove that if a countable theory T has the Schroder-Bernstein property then it is classifiable it is superstable and has NDOP and NOTOP and satisfies a slightly stronger condition than nonmultidimensionality, namely: there cannot be a model M of T, a type p over M, and an automorphism f of M such that for every two distinct natural numbers i and j, fip is orthogonal to fjp. We also make some conjectures about how the class of theories with the Schroder-Bernstein property can be characterized.","114"
"Magnetic dissipation through decay of Alfven waves in the magnetar magnetosphere is discussed. Transport of magnetic fields in the star leads to dissipation of the magnetic energy through either direct internal heating or transferring of the energy in waves that decay in the magnetar magnetosphere. In the latter case, the Alfven waves are excited by crust dislocations or elastic waves underneath the star's surface. It is suggested that these Alfven waves can decay into ion sound waves which can be effectively damped leading to strong plasma heating. Hot plasmas expand producing transient X-rays.","100"
"We consider extensions of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian to a general functional of metric and Riemann curvature tensor. A given such Lagrangian describes two different theories depending on considering connection and metric Palatini formulation, or only the metric metric formulation as independent dynamical degrees of freedom. Equivalence of the Palatini and metric formulations at the level of equations of motion, which as we will argue is a manifestation of the Equivalence Principle, is the physical criterion that restricts form of the Lagrangians of modified gravity theories. We prove that within the class of modified gravity theories we consider, only the Lovelock gravity satisfies this requirement.","112"

The resulting pion form factor in the space-like region is in excellent agreement with data in the whole range of accessible momentum transfers. The time-like form factor, known to reproduce the Gounaris-Sakurai formula at and near the rho-meson peak, is unaffected by the vertex correction at order calOg_rpp2.","106"
"We give a scheme for loss tolerantly building a linear optical quantum memory which itself is tolerant to qubit loss. We use the encoding recently introduced in Phys. Rev.

Our results suggest that it is possible to build a loss tolerant quantum memory, such that if the requirement is to keep the data stored over arbitrarily long times then this is possible with only polynomially increasing resources and logarithmically increasing individual photon life times.","109"
"Strong dense many-spin interactions have been proposed to organize novel orbital dynamics the Little Effect for novel chemical and catalytic phenomena. The recent determinations of the relativistic and quantum Hall effects of carriers in graphene under strong magnetic confinement have substantiated the Little Effect. Moreover such nonclassical phenomena under the stronger magnetic confinement of ferro-nanocatalysts are here shown to organize reverse beta processes and possibly pycnonuclear reactions under high temperature and high-pressure conditions. Such processes have implications for reverse beta reactions and nuclear reactions within the interior of the earth and new technologies for carbon nanotube-ferrometal and nanographene-ferrometal composites.","103"
"We investigate the usefulness of different classes of genuine quadripartite entangled states as quantum resources for teleportation and superdense coding. We examine the possibility of teleporting unknown one, two and three qubit states. We show that one can use the teleportation protocol to send any general one and two qubit states. A restricted class of three qubit states can also be faithfully teleported. We also explore superdense coding protocol in single-receiver and multi-receiver scenarios. We show that there exist genuine quadripartite entangled states that can be used to transmit four cbits by sending two qubits. We also discuss some interesting features of multi-receiver scenario under LOCC paradigm.","115"
"We propose an interesting model of neutrino masses to realize leptogenesis and dark matter at the TeV scale. A real scalar is introduced to naturally realize the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos. We also include a new Higgs doublet that contributes to the dark matter of the universe. The neutrino masses come from the vacuum expectation value of the triplet Higgs scalar. The right-handed neutrinos are not constrained by the neutrino masses and hence they could generate leptogenesis at the TeV scale without subscribing to resonant leptogenesis. In our model, all new particles could be observable at the forthcoming Large Hardon Collider or the proposed future International Linear Collider.","117"
"We consider real and complex scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity in the bulk spacetime and study their impact on the brane upon acquiring a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. When examining the case of the complex scalar field, a minimally coupled U1 gauge field is also considered so that spontaneous symmetry breaking can take place. Particular attention is paid to the terms arising from the junction conditions, which act towards reinforcing the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that the embedding of a braneworld universe in a bulk spacetime endowed with matter fields can induce this mechanism at very high energies, which implies the localization on the brane of the bulk fields.","120"
"In our previous work, we introduced a double-sided technique that utilizes but not reject the host interference. Due to its nice property of utilizing but not rejecting the host interference, it has a big advantage over the host interference schemes in that the perceptual analysis can be easily implemented for our scheme to achieve the locally bounded maximum embedding strength. Thus, in this work, we detail how to implement the perceptual analysis in our double-sided schemes since the perceptual analysis is very important for improving the fidelity of watermarked contents. Through the extensive performance comparisons, we can further validate the performance advantage of our double-sided schemes.","115"
"Using conformal field theory, we derive several new crossing formulas at the two-dimensional percolation point. High-precision simulation confirms these results. Integrating them gives a unified derivation of Cardy's formula for the horizontal crossing probability Pi_hr, Watts' formula for the horizontal-vertical crossing probability Pi_hvr, and Cardy's formula for the expected number of clusters crossing horizontally mathcalN_hr. The main step in our approach implies the identification of the derivative of one primary operator with another. We present operator identities that support this idea and suggest the presence of additional symmetry in c0 conformal field theories.","104"
"We have studied the interplay of an Anderson impurity in Landau quantized graphene, with special emphasis on the influence of the chemical potential. Within the slave-boson mean-field theory, we found reentrant Kondo behaviour by varying the chemical potential or gate voltage. Between Landau levels, the density of states is suppressed, and by changing the graphene's Fermi energy, we cross from metallic to semiconducting regions. Hence, the corresponding Kondo behaviour is also influenced. The f-level spectral function reveals both the presence of Landau levels in the conduction band and the Kondo resonance.","103"
"The results of extensive histogram cluster heat-bath Monte Carlo simulations on the critical behavior of the quasi-one dimensional Ising antiferromagnet on a stacked triangular lattice are presented. A small applied field is shown to induce a crossover from XY universality to mean-field tricritical behavior. Experimental estimates of critical exponents suggest that these two types of phase transitions are observed in S1 CsNiCl_3 and S12 CsCoBr_3, respectively. The present results demonstrate that this difference can be explained by an unusual staggered magnetic field arising from quantum exchange mixing previously proposed to account for spin excitations in S12 quasi-one-dimensional Ising antiferromagnets.","104"
"Using a generalized model of interaction between a two-level system TLS and an arbitrary deformation of the material, we calculate the interaction of Lamb modes with TLSs in amorphous nanoscopic membranes. We compare the mean free paths of the Lamb modes with different symmetries and calculate the heat conductivity kappa. In the limit of an infinitely wide membrane, the heat conductivity is divergent. Nevertheless, the finite size of the membrane imposes a lower cut-off for the phonons frequencies, which leads to the temperature dependence kappapropto Tabln T. This temperature dependence is a hallmark of the TLS-limited heat conductance at low temperature.","109"
"We calculate the dc supercurrent through a Josephson tunnel junction consisting of an antiferromagnetic AF interlayer sandwiched between two d-wave superconductors d. Such dAFd junctions exhibit a rich dependence of the Josephson current on the interlayer parameters, including the possibility of 0-pi transitions with varying temperature or interlayer thickness. Furthermore, we study dId junctions when the dSC leads include subdominant magnetic correlations. In this case induced magnetism near the interface can strongly diminish the critical current for 110 oriented junctions whereas no suppression is obtained for the 100 orientation. This may help resolve a long-standing puzzle of the critical current versus grain boundary angle in high-T_c superconductors.","113"
"This paper studies the relationship between vector-valued BMO functions and the Carleson measures defined by their gradients. Let dA and dm denote Lebesgue measures on the unit disc D and the unit circle mathbb T, respectively.

The validity of the converse inequality is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent q-uniformly smooth norm.","109"
"We remind the reader that it is possible to tell if two or more eigenvalues of a matrix are equal, without calculating the eigenvalues. We then use this property to detect avoided crossings in the spectra of quantum Hamiltonians representable by matrices. This approach provides a pedagogical introduction to avoided crossings, is capable of handling realistic Hamiltonians analytically, and offers a way to visualize crossings which is sometimes superior to that provided by the spectrum. We illustrate the method using the Breit-Rabi Hamiltonian to describe the hyperfine-Zeeman structure of the ground state hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field.","106"
"Graded C-algebras by a semi lattice were introduced and studied by Anne Boutet de Monvel, Vladimir Georgescu and their collaborators in relation with the quantum N body problem. This thesis is devoted to a systematic study of these algebras and their properties. In particular, we show that they are completely described by their homogenous subalgebras and that they are invariant under several operations such as tensor products, crossed products by actions of locally compact groups that respect the graduation. We give the K-theory of graded C-algebras and finally, we study some examples of such algebras.","103"
"We present the two-loop virtual QCD corrections to the production of heavy quarks in the quark--anti-quark--annihilation channel in the limit when all kinematical invariants are large compared to the mass of the heavy quark. Our result is exact up to terms suppressed by powers of the heavy-quark mass. The derivation is based on a simple relation between massless and massive scattering amplitudes in gauge theories proposed recently by two of the authors as well as a direct calculation of the massive amplitude at two loops. The results presented here form an important part of the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD contributions to heavy-quark production in hadron-hadron collisions.","113"
"Selection of an ensemble of equally prepared quantum systems, based on measurements on it, is a basic step in quantum state purification. For an ensemble of single qubits, iterative application of selective dynamics has been shown to lead to complex chaos, which is a novel form of quantum chaos with true sensitivity to the initial conditions. The Julia set of initial valuse with no convergence shows a complicated structre on the complex plane. The shape of the Julia set varies with the parameter of the dynamics. We present here results for the two qubit case demonstrating how a purification process can be destroyed with chaotic oscillations.","115"
"We study the motion of two non-interacting quantum particles performing a random walk on a line and analyze the probability that the two particles are detected at a particular position after a certain number of steps meeting problem. The results are compared to the corresponding classical problem and differences are pointed out. Analytic formulas for the meeting probability and its asymptotic behavior are derived. The decay of the meeting probability for distinguishable particles is faster then in the classical case, but not quadratically faster. Entangled initial states and the bosonic or fermionic nature of the walkers are considered.","104"
"GZKFast is a low-cost astrophysical event generator designed to simulate photohadron processes resulting from ultra high energy cosmic ray fluxes. GZKFast is an easy to use event generator which specifically addresses issues relevant to cosmogenic neutrinos and the ultra high energy UHE neutrino spectrum. GZKFast injects UHE particles into a simulated cosmic microwave background CMB using a Monte Carlo approach. The interaction of each particle is simulated and the resulting detectable events are spooled to log files. Although GZKFast uses a simplified particle physics model and limited accelerator data it generates event distributions which are comparable with more thorough simulations such as the event generator SOPHIA","110"
"We analyze the recurrence probability P'olya number for d-dimensional unbiased quantum walks. A sufficient condition for a quantum walk to be recurrent is derived. As a by-product we find a simple criterion for localisation of quantum walks. In contrast to classical walks, where the P'olya number is characteristic for the given dimension, the recurrence probability of a quantum walk depends in general on the topology of the walk, choice of the coin and the initial state. This allows to change the character of the quantum walk from recurrent to transient by altering the initial state.","103"
"The abundances of anti-protons and protons are considered within momentum-integrated Boltzmann equations describing Little Bangs, i.e., fireballs created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Despite of a large anti-proton annihilation cross section we find a small drop of the ratio of anti-protons to protons from 170 MeV chemical freeze-out temperature till 100 MeV kinetic freeze-out temperature for CERN-SPS and BNL-RHIC energies thus corroborating the solution of the previously exposed ""ani-proton puzzle"". In contrast, the Big Bang evolves so slowly that the anti-baryons are kept for a long time in equilibrium resulting in an exceedingly small fraction. The adiabatic path of cosmic matter in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is mapped out.","120"
"We discuss coherent and incoherent phi meson photoproduction off the deuteron at low energy and small momentum transfer with the aim to check whether the recent experimental data need for their interpretation the inclusion of exotic channels. Our analysis of the differential cross section and spin-density matrix elements shows that the existing data may be understood on the base of conventional dynamics. For a firm conclusion about a possible manifestation of exotic channels one has to improve the resolution of the data with providing additional information on channels with spin- and double-spin flip transitions being sensitive to the properties of the photoproduction amplitude in gamma p and gamma D reactions.","113"
"We introduce a simple general method for finding the equilibrium distribution for a class of widely used inexact Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The explicit error due to the non-commutivity of the updating operators when numerically integrating Hamilton's equations can be derived using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. This error is manifest in the conservation of a shadow'' Hamiltonian that lies close to the desired Hamiltonian. The fixed point distribution of inexact Hybrid algorithms may then be derived taking into account that the fixed point of the momentum heatbath and that of the molecular dynamics do not coincide exactly. We perform this derivation for various inexact algorithms used for lattice QCD calculations.","117"
"We compare experimental resistivity data on Ga_1-xMn_xAs films with theoretical calculations using a scaling theory for strongly disordered ferromagnets. All characteristic features of the temperature dependence of the resistivity can be quantitatively understood through this approach as originating from the close vicinity of the metal-insulator transition. In particular, we find that the magnetic field induced changes in resistance cannot be explained within a mean-field treatment of the magnetic state, and that accounting for thermal fluctuations is crucial for a quantitative analysis. Similarly, while the non-interacting scaling theory is in reasonable agreement with the data, we find clear evidence in favor of interaction effects at low temperatures.","115"
"Vscape is an interactive tool for studying the one-loop effective potential of an ungauged supersymmetric model of chiral multiplets. The program allows the user to define a supersymmetric model by specifying the superpotential. The F-terms and the scalar and fermionic mass matrices are calculated symbolically. The program then allows you to search numerically for metastable minima of the one-loop effective potential. Additional commands enable you to further study specific minima, by e.g. computing the mass spectrum for those vacua. Vscape combines the flexibility of symbolic software, with the speed of a numerical package.","102"
"Particle statistics plays a crucial role in a strongly interacting quantum many-body system. Here, we study the Hubbard model for distinguishable particles at unit filling. Starting from the superfluid-like state in the strong tunneling limit and gradually reducing the tunneling so that the on-site repulsive interaction dominates, the state ends up in a symmetric superposition of Mott insulator states. This result can be experimentally confirmed by the recovery of interference patterns in the density correlation functions. We also show that this state is a maximally entangled state, in contrast to the standard picture.","101"
"We prove an area law for the entanglement entropy in gapped one dimensional quantum systems. The bound on the entropy grows surprisingly rapidly with the correlation length; we discuss this in terms of properties of quantum expanders and present a conjecture on completely positive maps which may provide an alternate way of arriving at an area law. We also show that, for gapped, local systems, the bound on Von Neumann entropy implies a bound on R'enyi entropy for sufficiently large alpha1 and implies the ability to approximate the ground state by a matrix product state.","102"
"We construct a graph G such that any embedding of G into R3 contains a nonsplit link of two components, where at least one of the components is a nontrivial knot. Further, for any m  n we produce a graph H so that every embedding of H contains a nonsplit n component link, where at least m of the components are nontrivial knots. We then turn our attention to complete graphs and show that for any given n, every embedding of a large enough complete graph contains a two component link whose linking number is a nonzero multiple of n.","107"
"The group E3SO3 s T3, that is the homogeneous subgroup of the Galilei group parameterized by rotation angles and velocities, defines the continuous group of transformations between the frames of inertial particles in Newtonian mechanics. We show in this paper that the continuous group of transformations between the frames of noninertial particles following trajectories that satisfy Hamilton's equations is given by the Hamilton group Ha3SO3 s H3 where H3 is the Weyl-Heisenberg group that is parameterized by rates of change of position, momentum and energy, i.e. velocity, force and power. The group E3 is the inertial special case of the Hamilton group.","112"
"Carbon nanotube CNT Josephson junctions in the open quantum dot limit exhibit superconducting switching currents which can be controlled with a gate electrode. Shapiro voltage steps can be observed under radiofrequency current excitations, with a damping of the phase dynamics that strongly depends on the gate voltage. These measurements are described by a standard RCSJ model showing that the switching currents from the superconducting to the normal state are close to the critical current of the junction. The effective dynamical capacitance of the nanotube junction is found to be strongly gate-dependent, suggesting a diffusive contact of the nanotube.","104"
"We discuss several methods to produce superpositions of optical coherent states also known as ""cat states"". Cat states have remarkable properties that could allow them to be powerful tools for quantum information processing and metrology. A number of proposals for how one can produce cat states have appeared in the literature in recent years. We describe these proposals and present new simulation and analysis of them incorporating practical issues such as photon loss, detector inefficiency, and limited strength of nonlinear interactions. We also examine how each would perform in a realistic experiment.","101"
"The 200 K protein dynamical transition is observed for the first time in the teraherz dielectric response. The complex dielectric permittivity epsilon  epsilon'  iepsilon"" is determined in the 0.2 - 2.0 THz and 80-294 K ranges. epsilon"" has a linear temperature dependence up to 200 K then sharply increases. The low temperature linear dependence in epsilon"" indicates anharmonicity for temperatures 80 K  T  180 K, challenging the assumed harmonicity below 200K. The temperature dependence is consistent with beta relaxation response and shows the protein motions involved in the dynamical transition extend to subpicosecond time scales.","105"
"The Noetherian type of a space is the least kappa such that it has a base that is kappa-like with respect to containment. Just as all known homogeneous compacta have cellularity at most 2omega, they satisfy similar upper bounds in terms of Noetherian type and related cardinal functions. We prove these and many other results about these cardinal functions. For example, every homogeneous dyadic compactum has Noetherian type omega. Assuming GCH, every point in a homogeneous compactum X has a local base that is cX-like with respect to containment. If every point in a compactum has a well-quasiordered local base, then some point has a countable local pi-base.","118"
"We show that the Galactic thick disk reaches at least solar metallicities, and that it experienced strong chemical enrichment during a period of 3 Gyr, ending around 8-9 Gyr ago. This finding puts further constraints on the relation and interface between the thin and thick disks, and their formation processes. Our results are based on a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 261 kinematically selected F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood: 194 likely members of the thick disk and 67 likely members of the thin disk, in the range -1.3FeH0.4.","100"
"We determine the radio-frequency RF spectra for non-stationary states of a fermionic condensate produced by a rapid switch of the scattering length. The RF spectrum of the nonequilibrium state with constant BCS order parameter has two features in contrast to equilibrium where there is a single peak. The additional feature reflects the presence of excited pairs in the steady state. In the state characterized by periodically oscillating order parameter RF-absorption spectrum contains two sequences of peaks spaced by the frequency of oscillations. Satellite peaks appear due to a process where an RF photon in addition to breaking a pair emitsabsorbs oscillation quanta.","107"
"Quantum transport properties in quantum Hall wires in the presence of spatially correlated random potential are investigated numerically. It is found that the potential correlation reduces the localization length associated with the edge state, in contrast to the naive expectation that the potential correlation increases it. The effect appears as the sizable shift of quantized conductance plateaus in long wires, where the plateau transitions occur at energies much higher than the Landau band centers. The scale of the shift is of the order of the strength of the random potential and is insensitive to the strength of magnetic fields. Experimental implications are also discussed.","111"
"We present first results on the topological reconstruction of open charm mesons in pp collisions at snn  200 GeV using electron tagging. The analysis makes use of the full acceptance of the STAR electromagnetic calorimeter during Run VI data taking. A clear D0 signal is obtained with a remarkable signal-to-background ratio of about 17 and a signal significance of about 4. The azimuthal correlation distribution of the subleading electrons associated with open charm mesons exhibits a two-peak structure. We found first indications for prompt charm meson pair production. This correlation technique allows detailed energy loss measurements of open charm mesons in heavy-ion collisions.","109"

An overview of the expected sensitivity in the measurement of the Higgs boson properties is also given.","100"
"We calculate the free energy of the disordered urn model using the law of large numbers. It is revealed that the saddle point equation obtained by the usage of the law of large numbers is the same as that obtained by the replica method. Hence, we conclude that the replica symmetric solution is adequate for the disordered urn model. Furthermore, we point out the mathematical similarity of free energies between the urn models and the Random Field Ising Model; this similarity gives an evidence that the replica symmetric solution of the urn models is exact.","102"
"We consider a real-valued path; it is possible to associate a tree to this path, and we explore the relations between the tree, the properties of p-variation of the path, and integration with respect to the path. In particular, the fractal dimension of the tree is estimated from the variations of the path, and Young integrals with respect to the path, as well as integrals from the rough paths theory, are written as integrals on the tree. Examples include some stochastic paths such as martingales, L'evy processes and fractional Brownian motions for which an estimator of the Hurst parameter is given.","113"
"The structural and electronic properties of the carbonyl sulfide dimer anion are calculated using density functional theory within a pseudopotential method. Three geometries are optimized and investigated: C2v and C2 symmetric, as well as one asymmetric structure. A distribution of an excess charge in three isomers are studied by the Hirshfeld method. In an asymmetric OCS2- isomer the charge is not equally divided between the two moieties, but it is distributed as OCS-0.6 OCS-0.4. Low-lying excitation levels of three isomers are compared using the time-dependent density functional theory in the Casida approach.","100"
"We present an analysis of noisy atomic channels involving qutrits. We choose a three-level atom with V-configuration to be the qutrit state. Gell-Mann matrices and a generalized Bloch vector 8-dimensional are used to describe the qutrit density operator. We introduce quantum quasi-distributions for qutrits that provide a simple description of entanglement. Studying the time-evolution for the atomic variables we find the Kraus representation of spontaneous emission quantum channel SE channel. Furthermore, we consider a generalized Werner state of two qutrits and investigate the separability condition in the presence of spontaneous emission noise. The influence of spontaneous emission on the separability of Werner states for qutrit and qubit states is compared.","118"
"Linearly polarized light tuned slightly below the optical transition of the negatively charged exciton trion in a single quantum dot causes the spontaneous nuclear spin polarization self-polarization at a level close to 100. The effective magnetic field of spin-polarized nuclei brings the optical transition energy into resonance with photon energy. The resonantly enhanced Overhauser effect sustains the stability of the nuclear self-polarization even in the absence of spin polarization of the quantum dot electron. As a result the optically selected single quantum dot represents a tiny magnet with the ferromagnetic ordering of nuclear spins - the nuclear spin nanomagnet.","103"
"A geometric approach to time-dependent optimal control problems is proposed. This formulation is based on the Skinner and Rusk formalism for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. The corresponding unified formalism developed for optimal control systems allows us to formulate geometrically the necessary conditions given by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, provided that the differentiability with respect to controls is assumed and the space of controls is open. Furthermore, our method is also valid for implicit optimal control systems and, in particular, for the so-called descriptor systems optimal control problems including both differential and algebraic equations.","101"
"Using pulsed laser ablation with arsenic over pressure, the growth conditions for GaAs nanowires have been systematically investigated and optimized. Arsenic over pressure with As_2 molecules was introduced to the system by thermal decomposition of polycrystalline GaAs to control the stoichiometry and shape of the nanowires during growth. GaAs nanowires exhibit a variety of geometries under varying arsenic over pressure, which can be understood by different growth processes via vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. Single-crystal GaAs nanowires with uniform diameter, lengths over 20 mum, and thin surface oxide layer were obtained and can potentially be used for further electronic characterization.","105"
"It has been recently shown that the quantum Boltzmann equations may be relevant for the leptogenesis scenario. In particular, they lead to a time-dependent CP asymmetry which depends upon the previous dynamics of the system. This memory effect in the CP asymmetry is particularly important in resonant leptogenesis where the asymmetry is generated by the decays of nearly mass-degenerate right-handed neutrinos. We study the impact of the nontrivial time evolution of the CP asymmetry in resonant leptogenesis, both in the one-flavour case and with flavour effects included. We show that significant qualitative and quantitative differences arise with respect to the case in which the time dependence of the CP asymmetry is neglected.","119"
"Quantum Weak Energy Inequalities QWEIs are results which limit the extent to which the smeared renormalised energy density of a quantum field can be negative. On globally hyperbolic spacetimes the massive quantum Dirac field is known to obey a QWEI in terms of a reference state chosen arbitrarily from the class of Hadamard states; however, there exist spacetimes of interest on which state-dependent bounds cannot be evaluated. In this paper we prove the first QWEI for the massive quantum Dirac field on four dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime in which the bound depends only on the local geometry; such a QWEI is known as an absolute QWEI.","113"
"We present cosmological perturbation theory in neutrino probe interacting dark-energy models, and calculate cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectrum. In these models, the evolution of the mass of neutrinos is determined by the quintessence scalar field, which is responsible for the cosmic acceleration today. We consider several types of scalar field potentials and put constraints on the coupling parameter between neutrinos and dark energy. Assuming the flatness of the universe, the constraint we can derive from the current observation is sum m_nu  0.87 eV at the 95  confidence level for the sum over three species of neutrinos.","107"
"In this paper we revisit Safra's determinization constructions for automata on infinite words. We show how to construct deterministic automata with fewer states and, most importantly, parity acceptance conditions. Determinization is used in numerous applications, such as reasoning about tree automata, satisfiability of CTL, and realizability and synthesis of logical specifications. The upper bounds for all these applications are reduced by using the smaller deterministic automata produced by our construction. In addition, the parity acceptance conditions allows to use more efficient algorithms when compared to handling Rabin or Streett acceptance conditions.","103"

The r.m.s. point resolution of a padrow is compared with simulation and with an analytical calculation. The fundamental limitations due to detector geometry and gas properties are reviewed and the measured performances of the detector are found to be close to this limit. A numerical application to the case of a Linear Collider TPC is presented.","100"
"Constraint languages that arise from finite algebras have recently been the object of study, especially in connection with the Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi. An important class of algebras are those that generate congruence distributive varieties and included among this class are lattices, and more generally, those algebras that have near-unanimity term operations. An algebra will generate a congruence distributive variety if and only if it has a sequence of ternary term operations, called Jonsson terms, that satisfy certain equations. We prove that constraint languages consisting of relations that are invariant under a short sequence of Jonsson terms are tractable by showing that such languages have bounded relational width.","119"
"We explore the method of Robinson and Wilczek for deriving the Hawking temperature of a black hole. In this method, the Hawking radiation restores general covariance in an effective theory of near-horizon physics which otherwise exhibits a gravitational anomaly at the quantum level. The method has been shown to work for broad classes of black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. These include static black holes, accreting or evaporating black holes, charged black holes, rotating black holes, and even black rings. In the case of charged and rotating black holes, the expected super-radiant current is also reproduced.","107"
"We construct new supersymmetric solutions, including AdS bubbles, in an N2 truncation of five-dimensional N8 gauged supergravity. This particular truncation is given by N2 gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiples and three incomplete hypermultiplets, and was originally investigated in the context of obtaining regular AdS bubble geometries with multiple active R-charges. We focus on cohomogeneity-one solutions corresponding to objects with two equal angular momenta and up to three independent R-charges. Curiously, we find a new set of zero and negative mass solitons asymptotic to AdS_5Z_k, for k ge 3, which are everywhere regular without closed timelike curves.","108"

The boson pairs are produced in ppbar collisions at sqrts1.96 TeV, and the data sample corresponds to 350 pb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. In this search one W decays to leptons, and the other boson W or Z decays hadronically. Combining with a previously published CDF measurement of Wgamma boson production yields ATGC limits of -0.18  lambda  0.17 and -0.46  Delta kappa  0.39 at the 95 confidence level, using a cut-off scale Lambda1.5 TeV.","106"
"We present a particle filter construction for a system that exhibits time-scale separation. The separation of time-scales allows two simplifications that we exploit: i The use of the averaging principle for the dimensional reduction of the system needed to solve for each particle and ii the factorization of the transition probability which allows the Rao-Blackwellization of the filtering step. Both simplifications can be implemented using the coarse projective integration framework. The resulting particle filter is faster and has smaller variance than the particle filter based on the original system. The method is tested on a multiscale stochastic differential equation and on a multiscale pure jump diffusion motivated by chemical reactions.","116"
"This paper presents simulations of the trajectories of high-energy ions through several bent crystal layers. At certain layer alignments volume reflection occurs from each layer and the resultant multiple volume reflection angle is correspondingly increased, along with the range of entrance angles over which ions undergo volume reflection. Another feature is that the range of entrance angles for which bent crystal channeling occurs is also increased in passing through several bent layers. The use of several bent crystal layers to produce multiple volume reflection provides an alternative approach to the design of a space shield or radiation protection at accelerators based on bent crystals.","109"

"We suggest a simple deterministic approximation for the growth of the favoured-allele frequency during a selective sweep. Using this approximation we introduce an accurate model for genetic hitch-hiking. Only when Ns  10 N is the population size and s denotes the selection coefficient, are discrepancies between our approximation and direct numerical simulations of a Moran model noticeable. Our model describes the gene genealogies of a contiguous segment of neutral loci close to the selected one, and it does not assume that the selective sweep happens instantaneously. This enables us to compute SNP distributions on the neutral segment without bias.","106"

By quasi-linearizing the Navier-Stokes equation, we solve analytically the induction equation in quasi-normal approximation. We find that, if the magnetic field is not helical, the magnetic energy and correlation length evolve in time respectively as E_B propto t-21p3p and xi_B propto t23p, where p is the index of initial power-law spectrum. In the helical case, the magnetic helicity is an almost conserved quantity and forces the magnetic energy and correlation length to scale as E_B propto log t13 t-23 and xi_B propto log t-13 t23.","106"
"A major difficulty in realizing a solid-state quantum computer is the reliable measurement of the states of the quantum registers. In this paper, we propose an efficient readout scheme making use of the resonant tunneling of a ballistic electron produced by a single electron pump. We treat the measurement interaction in detail by modeling the full spatial configuration, and show that for pumped electrons with suitably chosen energy the transmission coefficient is very sensitive to the qubit state. We further show that by using a short sequence of pumping events, coupled with a simple feedback control procedure, the qubit can be measured with high accuracy.","113"
"An explanation of the recently discovered 7 s pulsations from the isolated neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 is presented. It is assumed that the real spin period of this source is approx1 s, whereas the observed spin-modulation is caused by the presence of a nearly transverse, very low frequency drift waves in the pulsar magnetosphere. It is supposed that the period of the drift wave is equal to a recently observed one. The simulated lightcurve is plotted, the angular parameters are defined and the value of the pulsed fraction of only sim 1.2 is explained.","101"
"We study the effect of a one dimensional optical superlattice on the superfluid fraction, number squeezing, dynamic structure factor and the quasi-momentum distribution of the Mott-insulator. We show that due to the secondary lattice,there is a decrease in the superfluid fraction and the number fluctuation. The dynamic structure factor which can be measured by Bragg spectroscopy is also suppressed due to the addition of the secondary lattice. The visibility of the interference pattern the quasi-momentum distributionof the Mott-insulator is found to decrease due to the presence of the secondary lattice. Our results have important implications in atom interferometry and quantum computation in optical lattices.","113"
"For the nonlinear Schreodinger equation NLSE, in presence of disorder, exponentially localized stationary states are found. In the present Letter it is demonstrated analytically that the localization length is typically independent of the strength of the nonlinearity and is identical to the one found for the corresponding linear equation. The analysis makes use of the correspondence between the stationary NLSE and the Langevin equation as well as of the resulting Fokker-Planck equation. The calculations are performed for the white noise'' random potential and an exact expression for the exponential growth of the eigenstates is obtained analytically. It is argued that the main conclusions are robust.","113"
"The long-root elements in Lie algebras of Chevalley type have been well studied and can be characterized as extremal elements, that is, elements x such that the image of ad x2 lies in the subspace spanned by x. In this paper, assuming an algebraically closed base field of characteristic not 2, we find presentations of the Lie algebras of classical Chevalley type by means of minimal sets of extremal generators. The relations are described by simple graphs on the sets. For example, for C_n the graph is a path of length 2n, and for A_n the graph is the triangle connected to a path of length n-3.","117"
"Quantum corrections to transport through a chaotic ballistic cavity are known to be universal. The universality not only applies to the magnitude of quantum corrections, but also to their dependence on external parameters, such as the Fermi energy or an applied magnetic field. Here we consider such parameter dependence of quantum transport in a ballistic chaotic cavity in the semiclassical limit obtained by sending Planck's constant to zero without changing the classical dynamics of the open cavity. In this limit quantum corrections are shown to have a universal parametric dependence which is not described by random matrix theory.","105"
"We give the explicit structure of the functional governing the dynamical density and current fluctuations for a mesoscopic system in a nonequilibrium steady state. Its canonical form determines a generalised Onsager-Machlup theory. We assume that the system is described as a Markov jump process satisfying a local detailed balance condition such as typical for stochastic lattice gases and for chemical networks. We identify the entropy current and the traffic between the mesoscopic states as extra terms in the fluctuation functional with respect to the equilibrium dynamics. The density and current fluctuations are coupled in general, except close to equilibrium where their decoupling explains the validity of entropy production principles.","115"
"We investigate the single-spin asymmetries in inclusive and exclusive processes of electron-proton scattering and electron-positron annihilation. In the decomposition of hadronic tensor, a Lorentz symmetric spin-dependent term is generally present. The existence of such a term implies single-spin asymmetries in these processes and these single-spin asymmetries for baryons can be understood in a unified manner. We argue that it is important to measure the single-spin asymmetries in both inclusive and exclusive processes for the Lambda production at the present B-factories. This will lead to the first measurement of the structure function of the symmetric spin-dependent hadronic tensor in these processes.","106"
"Brane world models with a non-minimally coupled bulk scalar field have been studied recently. In this paper we consider metric fluctuations around an arbitrary gravity-scalar background solution, and we show that the corresponding spectrum includes a localized zero mode which strongly depends on the profile of the background scalar field. For a special class of solutions, with a warp factor of the RS form, we solve the linearized Einstein equations, for a point-like mass source on the brane, by using the brane bending formalism. We see that general relativity on the brane is recovered only if we impose restrictions on the parameter space of the models under consideration.","117"
"We suggest an iterative, maximum-likelihood-based, method to reconstruct the photon number distribution of the steady state cavity field of a micromaser starting from the statistics of the atoms leaving the cavity after the interaction. The scheme is based on measuring the atomic populations of probe atoms for different interaction times and works effectively using a small number of atoms and a limited sampling of the interaction times. The method has been tested by numerically simulated experiments showing that it may be reliably used in any micromaser regime leading to high-fidelity reconstructions for single-peaked distributions as well as for double-peaked ones and for trapping states.","109"
"We demonstrate a spin diode consisting of a semiconductor free nano-scale FeMgO-based double tunnel junction. The device exhibits a near perfect spin-valve effect combined with a strong diode effect. The mechanism consistent with our data is resonant tunneling through discrete states in the middle ferromagnetic layer sandwiched by tunnel barriers of different spin-dependent transparency. The observed magneto-resistance is record high, 4000, essentially making the structure an onoff spin-switch. This, combined with the strong diode effect, 100, offers a new device that should be promising for such technologies as magnetic random access memory and re-programmable logic.","105"
"We obtain a new symplectic Lagrangian density and deduce Faddeev-Jackiw FJ generalized brackets of the gauge invariant self-dual fields interacting with gauge fields. We further give FJ quantization of this system. Furthermore, the FJ method is compared with Dirac method, the results show the two methods are equivalent in the quantization of this system. And by the practical research in this letter, it can be found that the FJ method is really simpler than the Dirac method, namely, the FJ method obviates the need to distinguish primary and secondary constraints and first- and second-class constraints. Therefore, the FJ method is a more economical and effective method of quantization.","119"
"We propose a new method to produce self- and cross-Kerr photonic nonlinearities, using light-induced Stark shifts due to the interaction of a cavity mode with atoms. The proposed experimental set-up is considerably simpler than in previous approaches, while the strength of the nonlinearity obtained with a single atom is the same as in the setting based on electromagnetically induced transparency. Furthermore our scheme can be applied to engineer effective photonic nonlinear interactions whose strength increases with the number of atoms coupled to the cavity mode, leading to photon-photon interactions several orders of magnitude larger than previously considered possible.","104"
"In semi-inclusive DIS of polarized leptons on a transversely polarized target eight azimuthal modulations appear in the cross-section. Within QCD parton model four azimuthal asymmetries can be interpreted at leading order, two of them being the already measured Collins and Sivers asymmetries. The other two leading twist asymmetries, related to different transverse momentum dependent quark distribution functions, and also additional four asymmetries which can be interpreted as twist-three contributions have been measured for the first time at COMPASS, using a 160 GeVc longitudinally polarized P_beamsimeq -0.8 muon beam and a transversely polarized 6LiD target. We present here the preliminary results from the 2002-2004 data.","112"
"Nonuniform tubular neighborhoods of curves in Euclidean n-space are studied by using weighted distance functions and generalizing the normal exponential map. Different notions of injectivity radii are introduced to investigate singular but injective exponential maps. A generalization of the thickness formula is obtained for nonuniform thickness. All singularities within almost injectivity radius are classified by the Horizontal Collapsing Property. Examples are provided to show the distinction between the different types of injectivity radii, as well as showing that the standard differentiable injectivity radius fails to be upper semicontinuous on a singular set of weight functions.","101"
"We compare and contrast the different approaches to the optically thick adiabatic phase of GRB all the way to the transparency. Special attention is given to the role of the rate equation to be self consistently solved with the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. The works of Shemi and Piran 1990, Piran, Shemi and Narayan 1993, Meszaros, Laguna and Rees 1993 and Ruffini, Salmonson, Wilson and Xue 1999,2000 are compared and contrasted. The role of the baryonic loading in these three treatments is pointed out. Constraints on initial conditions for the fireball produced by electro-magnetic black hole are obtained.","108"
"We analytically evaluate charge and spin density response functions of the clean two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling at finite momenta and frequencies. On the basis of our exact expressions we discuss the accuracy of the long-wavelength and the quasiclassical approximations. We also derive the static limit of spin susceptibilities and demonstrate, in particular, how the Kohn-like anomalies in their derivatives are related to the spin-orbit modification of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. Taking into account screening and exchange effects of the Coulomb interaction, we describe the collective charge and spin density excitation modes which appear to be coupled due to nonvanishing spin-charge response function.","111"
"We explore the full counting statistics of single electron tunneling through a quantum dot using a quantum point contact as non-invasive high bandwidth charge detector. The distribution of counted tunneling events is measured as a function of gate and source-drain-voltage for several consecutive electron numbers on the quantum dot. For certain configurations we observe super-Poissonian statistics for bias voltages at which excited states become accessible. The associated counting distributions interestingly show a bimodal characteristic. Analyzing the time dependence of the number of electron counts we relate this to a slow switching between different electron configurations on the quantum dot.","104"
"Let m,n be positive integers. Define Tm,n to be the transportation polytope consisting of the m x n non-negative real matrices whose rows each sum to 1 and whose columns each sum to mn. The special case BnTn,n is the much-studied Birkhoff-von Neumann polytope of doubly-stochastic matrices. Using a recent asymptotic enumeration of non-negative integer matrices Canfield and McKay, 2007, we determine the asymptotic volume of Tm,n as n goes to infinity, with mmn such that mn neither decreases nor increases too quickly. In particular, we give an asymptotic formula for the volume of Bn.","112"
"Maser emission from the SiO molecule has been widely observed in the near-circumstellar envelopes of late-type, evolved stars. VLBI images can resolve individual SiO maser spots, providing information about the kinematics and magnetic field in the extended atmospheres of these stars. This poster presents full polarization images of several SiO maser lines towards the supergiant star VY CMa. VY CMa is a particularly strong SiO maser source and allows observations of a wide range of maser transitions. We discuss implications of these observations for VY CMa morphology, polarization, and pumping models.","100"
"We discuss massive scalar perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole. We argue that quantum effects alter the effective potential near the horizon resulting in Poincare recurrences in Green functions. Results at the semi-classical level are independent of the details of the modification of the potential provided its minimum near the horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the Poincare time. This modification may be viewed as a change in the near-horizon geometry. We consider explicitly the examples of a brick wall, a smooth cutoff and a wormhole-like modification showing that they all lead to the same results at leading order.","107"
"We consider a class of electromagnetic fields that contains crossed fields combined with longitudinal electric and magnetic fields. We study the motion of a classical particle solutions of the Lorentz equations in such fields. Then, we present an analysis that allows one to decide which fields from the class act as a beam guide for charged particles, and we find some time-independent and time-dependent configurations with beam guiding properties. We demonstrate that the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations with all the fields from the class can be solved exactly. We study these solutions, which were not known before, and prove that they form complete and orthogonal sets of functions.","117"
"We demonstrate the existence of a helical state in patterned multilayer nanomagnets. The artificial helimagnets consist of a stack of single domain ferromagnetic disks separated by insulating nonmagnetic spacers. The spiral state is shown to originate from the magnetostatic interaction between nearest and next nearest neighbouring single-domain disks in the stack. Since the magnetostatic interaction for such disks is rather strong, the helical state should be stable at room temperature. The helimagnets were fabricated from a CoSi3 multilayer using electron beam lithography. The helical state was confirmed by a magnetic stray field analysis using magnetic force microscopy.","104"
"We prove that the packing dimension of any mean porous Radon measure on mathbb Rd may be estimated from above by a function which depends on mean porosity. The upper bound tends to d-1 as mean porosity tends to its maximum value. This result was stated in citeBS, and in a weaker form in citeJJ1, but the proofs are not correct. Quite surprisingly, it turns out that mean porous measures are not necessarily approximable by mean porous sets. We verify this by constructing an example of a mean porous measure mu on mathbb R such that muA0 for all mean porous sets Asubsetmathbb R.","112"
"Modeling non Gaussian and non stationary signals and images has always been one of the most important part of signal and image processing methods. In this paper, first we propose a few new models, all based on using hidden variables for modeling either stationary but non Gaussian or Gaussian but non stationary or non Gaussian and non stationary signals and images. Then, we will see how to use these models in independent component analysis ICA or blind source separation BSS. The computational aspects of the Bayesian estimation framework associated with these prior models are also discussed.","103"
"A theory is presented for lambda_C, the coefficient of the first-order correction in the density of the collective diffusion coefficient, for protein spheres interacting by electrostatic and adhesive forces. An extensive numerical analysis of the Stokesian hydrodynamics of two moving spheres is given so as to gauge the precise impact of lubrication forces. An effective stickiness is introduced and a simple formula for lambda_C in terms of this variable is put forward. A precise though more elaborate approximation for lambda_C is also developed. These and numerically exact expressions for lambda_C are compared with experimental data on lysozyme at pH 4.5 and a range of ionic strengths between 0.05 M and 2 M.","119"

According to our numerical results, it is improbable to make the interpretation of cnbar cbar n_1 and cnbar cbar n_2 nu, d states as X3872 and Y3940, respectively. However, it is interesting to find the tetraquarks in the bqbar bbar q' system.","100"
"Based on the permutation group formalism, we present a discrete symmetry algebra in QCD. The discrete algebra is hidden symmetry in QCD, which is manifest only on a space-manifold with non-trivial topology. Quark confinement in the presence of the dynamical quarks is discussed in terms of the discrete symmetry algebra. It is shown that the quark deconfinement phase has the ground state degeneracy depending on the topology of the space, which gives a gauge-invariant distinction between the confinement and deconfinement phases. We also point out that new quantum numbers relating to the fractional quantum Hall effect exist in the deconfinement phase.","109"
"We study the single longitudinal-spin asymmetries in lepton-pair production with large transverse-momentum at RHIC and J-PARC experiments. The asymmetries in the azimuthal angular distribution of a lepton can arise from an absorptive part of production amplitudes. We revisit the one-loop calculation for the absorptive part of production amplitudes in perturbative QCD, and show that the asymmetries can be sizable at RHIC and J-PARC. Measurement of the asymmetries would test the one-loop prediction for the scattering phase of this process, and provide support for a study of the single transverse-spin asymmetries in the same kinematical region.","101"
"We report laser emission from single, stationary, Rhodamine B-doped glycerolwater microdroplets located on a superhydrophobic surface. In the experiments, a pulsed, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm was used as the excitation source. The microdroplets ranged in diameter from a few to 20 um. Lasing was achieved in the red-shifted portion of the dye emission spectrum with threshold fluences as low as 750 Jcm2. Photobleaching was observed when the microdroplets were pumped above threshold. In certain cases, multimode lasing was also observed and attributed to the simultaneous lasing of two modes belonging to different sets of whispering gallery modes.","113"
"Let Tt be an aperiodic and repetitive tiling of RMd with finite local complexity. We present a spectral sequence that converges to the K-theory of Tt with E_2-page given by a new cohomology that will be called PV in reference to the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence. It is a generalization of the Serre spectral sequence. The PV cohomology of Tt generalizes the cohomology of the base space of a fibration with local coefficients in the K-theory of its fiber. We prove that it is isomorphic to the vCech cohomology of the hull of Tt a compactification of the family of its translates.","106"
"We investigate the kaon semileptonic decay K_l3 form factors within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum, taking into account the effects of flavor SU3 symmetry breaking. All theoretical calculations are carried out without any adjustable parameter. We also show that the present results satisfy the Callan-Treiman low-energy theorem as well as the Ademollo-Gatto theorem. It turns out that the effects of flavor SU3 symmetry breaking are essential in reproducing the kaon semileptonic form factors. The present results are in a good agreement with experiments, and are compatible with other model calculations.","104"
"A remarkably high saturation magnetization of 0.4mu_BFe along with room temperature ferromagnetic hysteresis loop has been observed in nanoscale 4-40 nm multiferroic BiFeO_3 which in bulk form exhibits weak magnetization 0.02mu_BFe and an antiferromagnetic order. The magnetic hysteresis loops, however, exhibit exchange bias as well as vertical asymmetry which could be because of spin pinning at the boundaries between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Interestingly, like in bulk BiFeO_3, both the calorimetric and dielectric permittivity data in nanoscale BiFeO_3 exhibit characteristic features at the magnetic transition point. These features establish formation of a true ferromagnetic-ferroelectric system with a coupling between the respective order parameters in nanoscale BiFeO_3.","114"
"We construct an exact stationary solution of black hole -- bubble sequence in the five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory by using solitonic solution generating techniques. The solution describes two boosted black holes with topology S3 on a Kaluza-Klein bubble and has a linear momentum component in the compactified direction. The ADM mass and the linear momentum depend on the two boosted velocity parameters of black holes. In the effective four dimensional theory, the solution has an electric charge which is proportional to the linear momentum. The solution includes the static solution found by Elvang and Horowitz and a limit of single boosted black string.","109"
"The paper explores the use of nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 for hyperthermia treatment of living organisms by absorption of 1064 nm radiations from Nd:YAG laser. Escherichia coli cells have been used as the model system for demonstrating the effect wherein lysine is used as an interface between the cell walls and the nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscopic observations have, exclusively, proved that attachment of nanoparticles of iron oxide along with lysine alone is responsible for absorption of above radiations. The quantitative estimation has been provided by growth rate measurements and protein assessment of the cells. The nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 were synthesized by DC arc plasma assisted gas phase condensation.","118"
"Based on Planck's blackbody equation it is argued that a single mode light pulse, with a large number of photons, carries one entropy unit. Similarly, an empty radiation mode carries no entropy. In this case, the calculated entropy that a coded sequence of light pulses is carrying is simply the Gibbs mixing entropy, which is identical to the logical Shannon information. This approach is supported by a demonstration that information transmission and amplification, by a sequence of light pulses in an optical fiber, is a classic Carnot machine comprising of two isothermals and two adiabatic. Therefore it is concluded that entropy under certain conditions is information.","119"
"The commutation relations of the generalized Pauli operators of a qubit-qutrit system are discussed in the newly established graph-theoretic and finite-geometrical settings. The dual of the Pauli graph of this system is found to be isomorphic to the projective line over the product ring Z2xZ3. A ""peculiar"" feature in comparison with two-qubits is that two distinct pointsoperators can be joined by more than one line. The multi-line property is shown to be also present in the graphsgeometries characterizing two-qutrit and three-qubit Pauli operators' space and surmised to be exhibited by any other higher-level quantum system.","102"

"In this paper, we address the problem of discriminating two given quantum operations. Firstly, based on the Bloch representation of single qubit systems, we give the exact minimum error probability of discriminating two single qubit quantum operations by unentangled input states. In particular, for the Pauli channels discussed in Phys. Rev. A bf 71, 062340 2005, we use a more intuitional and visual method to deal with their discrimination problem. Secondly, we consider the condition for perfect discrimination of two quantum operations. Specially, we get that two generalized Pauli channels are perfectly distinguishable if and only if their characteristic vectors are orthogonal.","117"
"Dyson's integration theorem is widely used in the computation of eigenvalue correlation functions in Random Matrix Theory. Here we focus on the variant of the theorem for determinants, relevant for the unitary ensembles with Dyson index beta  2. We derive a formula reducing the n-k-fold integral of an n x n determinant of a kernel of two sets of arbitrary functions to a determinant of size k x k. Our generalisation allows for sets of functions that are not orthogonal or bi-orthogonal with respect to the integration measure. In the special case of orthogonal functions Dyson's theorem is recovered.","106"
"We study the survival of substructures clumps within larger self-gravitating dark matter halos. Building on scaling relations obtained from N-body calculations of violent relaxation, we argue that the tidal field of galaxies and halos can only destroy substructures if spherical symmetry is imposed at formation. We explore other mechanisms that may tailor the number of halo substructures during the course of virialization. Unless the larger halo is built up from a few large clumps, we find that clump-clump encounters are unlikely to homogenize the halo on a dynamical timescale. Phase mixing would proceed faster in the inner parts and allow for the secular evolution of a stellar disk.","115"
"An exactly solvable position-dependent mass Schr""odinger equation in two dimensions, depicting a particle moving in a semi-infinite layer, is re-examined in the light of recent theories describing superintegrable two-dimensional systems with integrals of motion that are quadratic functions of the momenta. To get the energy spectrum a quadratic algebra approach is used together with a realization in terms of deformed parafermionic oscillator operators. In this process, the importance of supplementing algebraic considerations with a proper treatment of boundary conditions for selecting physical wavefunctions is stressed. Some new results for matrix elements are derived. This example emphasizes the interest of a quadratic algebra approach to position-dependent mass Schr""odinger equations.","120"
"Zero-knowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be used as a basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols. An intrinsic characteristic of a zero-knowledge systems is the assumption that is impossible for the verifier to show to a third part that he has interacted with the prover. However, it has been shown that using quantum correlations the impossibility of transferring proofs can be successfully attacked. In this work we show two new protocols for proof transference, being the first one based on teleportation and the second one without using entangled states.","102"
"We study electron propagation through a random array of rare, opaque and large compared the de Broglie wavelength of electrons scatterers. It is shown that for any convex scatterer the ratio of the transport to quantum lifetimes etatau_trtau_tot does not depend on the shape of the scatterer but only on whether scattering is specular or diffuse and on the spatial dimensionality D. In particular, for specular scattering, eta is a universal constant determined only by the dimensionality of the system: eta  2 for D  3 and eta  32 for D  2. The crossover between classical and quantum regimes of scattering is discussed.","109"
"Microwave penetration depth lambda and surface resistance at 27 GHz are measured in high quality crystals of KOs_2O_6. Firm evidence for fully-gapped superconductivity is provided from lambdaT. Below the second transition at T_rm psim 8 K, the superfluid density shows a step-like change with a suppression of effective critical temperature T_rm c. Concurrently, the extracted quasiparticle scattering time shows a steep enhancement, indicating a strong coupling between the anomalous rattling motion of K ions and quasiparticles. The results imply that the rattling phonons help to enhance superconductivity, and that K sites freeze to an ordered state with long quasiparticle mean free path below T_rm p.","113"
"We compute the three master integrals for the crossed ladder diagram with two exchanged quanta of equal mass. The differential equations obeyed by the master integrals are used to generate power series expansions centered around all the singular plus some regular points, which are then matched numerically with high accuracy. The expansions allow a fast and precise numerical calculation of the three master integrals better than 15 digits with less than 30 terms in the whole real axis. A conspicuous relation with the equal-mass sunrise in two dimensions is found. Comparison with a previous large momentum expansion is made finding complete agreement.","108"
"We numerically investigate quantum diffusion of an electron in a model of polydG-polydC and polydA-polydT DNA polymers with fluctuation of the parameters due to the impact of colored noise. The randomness is introduced by fluctuations of distance between two consecutive bases along the stacked base pairs. We demonstrate that in the model the decay time of the correlation can control the spread of the electronic wavepacket. Furthermore it is shown that in a motional narrowing regime the averaging over fluctuation causes ballistic propagation of the wavepacket, and in the adiabatic regime the electronic states are affected by localization.","103"
"Dendriform structures arise naturally in algebraic combinatorics where they allow, for example, the splitting of the shuffle product into two pieces and through Rota-Baxter algebra structures the latter appear, among others, in differential systems and in the renormalization process of pQFT. We prove new combinatorial identities in dendriform dialgebras that appear to be strongly related to classical phenomena, such as the combinatorics of Lyndon words, rewriting rules in Lie algebras, or the fine structure of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer algebra. One of these identities is an abstract noncommutative, dendriform, generalization of the Bohnenblust-Spitzer identity and of an identity involving iterated Chen integrals due to C.S. Lam.","117"
"In this work linear stability analysis of a four-fluid optically thin plasma consisting of electrons, ions, neutral atoms, and charged dust particles is performed with respect to the radiation-condensation RC instability. The energy budget of the plasma involves the input from heating through photo-electron emission by dust particles under external ultraviolet radiation as well as radiative losses in inelastic electron-neutral, electron-ion, neutral-neutral collisions. It is shown that negatively charged particles stimulate the RC instability in the sense that the conditions for the instability to hold are wider than similar conditions in a single-fluid description.","102"
"Two methodological troubles of the quantum theory of collisions are considered. The first is the undesirable interference of the incident and scattered waves in the stationary approach to scattering. The second concerns the nonstationary approach to the theory of collisions of the type abto cd. In order to calculate the cross section one uses the matrix element cdSab of the S-matrix. The element is proportional to delta-function expressing the energy conservation. The corresponding probability  cdSab2 contains delta2 which is mathematically senseless. The known regular way to overcome the difficulty seems to be unsatisfactory. In this paper, both the troubles are resolved using wave packets of incident particles.","116"
"We investigate graphene and graphene layers on different substrates by monochromatic and white-light confocal Rayleigh scattering microscopy. The image contrast depends sensitively on the dielectric properties of the sample as well as the substrate geometry and can be described quantitatively using the complex refractive index of bulk graphite. For few layers 6 the monochromatic contrast increases linearly with thickness: the samples behave as a superposition of single sheets which act as independent two dimensional electron gases. Thus, Rayleigh imaging is a general, simple and quick tool to identify graphene layers, that is readily combined with Raman scattering, which provides structural identification.","110"
"We present the results of our QCD analysis for polarized quark distribution and structure function xg_1 x,Q2. We use very recently experimental data to parameterize our model. New parameterizations are derived for the quark and gluon distributions for the kinematic range x epsilon 10-8,1, Q2 epsilon 1,106 GeV2. The analysis is based on the Jacobi polynomials expansion of the polarized structure functions. Our calculations for polarized parton distribution functions based on the Jacobi polynomials method are in good agreement with the other theoretical models. The values of Lambda_QCD and alpha_sM_z are determined.","101"
"We establish a Poincar'e-Dulac theorem for sequences G_n_n of holomorphic contractions whose differentials d_0 G_n split regularly. The resonant relations determining the normal forms hold on the moduli of the exponential rates of contraction. Our results are actually stated in the framework of bundle maps. Such sequences of holomorphic contractions appear naturally as iterated inverse branches of endomorphisms of CPk. In this context, our normalization result allows to precisely estimate the distortions of ellipsoids along typical orbits. As an application, we show how the Lyapunov exponents of the equilibrium measure are approximated in terms of the multipliers of the repulsive cycles.","111"
"Time-of-flight TOF cameras are based on a new technology that delivers distance maps by the use of a modulated light source. In this paper we first describe a set of experiments that we performed with TOF cameras. We then propose a noise model which is able to explain some of the phenomena observed in the experiments. The model is based on assuming a noise source that is correlated with the light source shot noise and an additional additive noise source dark current noise. The model predicts well the dependency of the distance errors on the image intensity and the true distance at an individual pixel.","110"

We focus on a branch of observable consequence of landscape which predicts an open universe with negative curvature if e-foldings N62. After discussing the observable regulation from the aspect by Kaloper, Kleban and Sorbo, we make an argument that in the non-flat background the observable N is suppressed by a factor krho_0. We point out that this seems to detect the information where e-foldings N62 possibly. Finally, we discuss our outcomes with the recent work by Arkani-Hamed et al.","106"
"We study the superfluid-insulator transition in Bose-Hubbard models in one-, two-, and three-dimensional cubic lattices by means of a recently proposed variational wave function. In one dimension, the variational results agree with the expected Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario of the interaction-driven Mott transition. In two and three dimensions, we find evidences that, across the transition,most of the spectral weight is concentrated at high energies, suggestive of pre-formed Mott-Hubbard side-bands. This result is compatible with the experimental data by Stoferle et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 130403 2004.","102"
"The circle-equivariant spectrum MString_C is the equivariant analogue of the cobordism spectrum MU6 of stably almost complex manifolds with c_1c_20. Given a rational elliptic curve C, the second author has defined a ring T-spectrum EC representing the associated T-equivariant elliptic cohomology. The core of the present paper is the construction, when C is a complex elliptic curve, of a map of ring T-spectra MString_C -- EC which is the rational equivariant analogue of the sigma orientation of Ando-Hopkins-Strickland. We support this by a theory of characteristic classes for calculation, and a conceptual description in terms of algebraic geometry. In particular, we prove a conjecture of the first author.","118"
"We study the linear response in different models of driven granular gases. In some situations, even if the the velocity statistics can be strongly non-Gaussian, we do not observe appreciable violations of the Einstein formula for diffusion versus mobility. The situation changes when strong correlations between velocities and density are present: in this case, although a form of fluctuation-dissipation relation holds, the differential velocity response of a particle and its velocity self-correlation are no more proportional. This happens at high densities and strong inelasticities, but still in the fluid-like and ergodic regime.","102"
"Strangeness and multi-strangeness particles production can be used to explore the initial transient field fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We emphasize the role played by Junction anti-Junction JJbar loops and strong color electric fields SCF in these collisions. Transient field fluctuations of SCF on the baryon production in central 0-5 PbPb collisions at nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy of 5.5 TeV will be discussed in the framework of HIJINGBBbar v2.0 model, looking in particular to the predicted evolution of nuclear modification factors R_AA from RHIC to LHC energies. Our results indicate the importance of a good description of the baseline elementary pp collisions at this energy.","111"
"The search for the Higgs boson is one of the main physics goals of the Large Hadron Collider LHC and its two multi-purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS. Vector boson fusion is the second largest production process for a standard model Higgs boson at the LHC and offers excellent means for background suppression. This paper gives an overview of the prospects of Higgs boson searches using vector boson fusion at the LHC. For a standard model Higgs boson, the decay channels H-tautau, H-WW and H-gammagamma are discussed. The discovery potential in the framework of the MSSM is summarized.","105"
"A phase field model for dealing with shape instabilities in fluid membrane vesicles is presented. This model takes into account the Canham-Helfrich bending energy with spontaneous curvature. A dynamic equation for the phase-field is also derived. With this model it is possible to see the vesicle shape deformation dynamically, when some external agent instabilizes the membrane, for instance, inducing an inhomogeneous spontaneous curvature. The numerical scheme used is detailed and some stationary shapes are shown together with a shape diagram for vesicles of spherical topology and no spontaneous curvature, in agreement with known results.","103"
"Forest-fire waiting times, defined as the time between successive events above a certain size in a given region, are calculated for Italy. The probability densities of the waiting times are found to verify a scaling law, despite that fact that the distribution of fire sizes is not a power law. The meaning of such behavior in terms of the possible self-similarity of the process in a nonstationary system is discussed. We find that the scaling law arises as a consequence of the stationarity of fire sizes and the existence of a non-trivial instantaneous'' scaling law, sustained by the correlations of the process.","111"
"In this paper we compute certain two-point integrals over a moduli space of stable maps into projective space. Computation of one-point analogues of these integrals constitutes a proof of mirror symmetry for genus-zero one-point Gromov-Witten invariants of projective hypersurfaces. The integrals computed in this paper constitute a significant portion in the proof of mirror symmetry for genus-one GW-invariants completed in a separate paper. These integrals also provide explicit mirror formulas for genus-zero two-point GW-invariants of projective hypersurfaces. The approach described in this paper leads to a reconstruction algorithm for all genus-zero GW-invariants of projective hypersurfaces.","100"
"The e,n-complexity functions describe total instability of trajectories in dynamical systems. They reflect an ability of trajectories going through a Borel set to diverge on the distance epsilon during the time interval n. Behavior of the e, n-complexity functions as n goes to infinity is reflected in the properties of special measures. These measures are constructed as limits of atomic measures supported at points of e,n-separated sets. We study such measures. In particular, we prove that they are invariant if the e,n-complexity function grows subexponentially. Keywords: Topological entropy, complexity functions, separability.","108"
"Dark matter annihilation and other processes may precipitate a flux of diffuse ultra-high energy gamma-rays. These gamma-rays may be observable in present day experiments which observe diffuse fluxes at the GeV scale. Yet the universe is presently opaque to gamma-rays above 10 TeV. It is generally assumed that cascade radiation is observable at all high energies, however the disparity in energy from production to observation has important consequences for theoretical flux limits. We detail the physics of cascade radiation development and consider the influence of energy and redshift scale on arbitrary flux limits that result from electromagnetic cascade.","104"
"We study the Schwinger mechanism in QCD in the presence of an arbitrary time-dependent chromo-electric background field Eat with arbitrary color index a1,2,...8 in SU3. We obtain an exact result for the non-perturbative quark antiquark production from an arbitrary Eat by directly evaluating the path integral. We find that the exact result is independent of all the time derivatives fracdnEatdtn where n1,2,...infty. This result has the same functional dependence on two Casimir invariants EatEat and d_abcEatEbtEct2 as the constant chromo-electric field Ea result with the replacement: Ea rightarrow Eat. This result relies crucially on the validity of the shift conjecture, which has not yet been established.","119"
"We study the process by which quantum correlations are created when an interaction Hamiltonian is repeatedly applied to a system of two harmonic oscillators for some characteristic time interval. We show that, for the case where the oscillator frequencies are equal, the initial Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions of the uncoupled parts evolve to a new equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution through a series of transient Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Further, we discuss why the equilibrium reached when the two oscillator frequencies are unequal, is not a thermal one. All the calculations are exact and the results are obtained through an iterative process, without using perturbation theory.","109"
"In this paper we present a direct perturbative method to solving certain Fokker-Planck equations, which have constant diffusion coefficients and some small parameters in the drift coefficients. The method makes use of the connection between the Fokker-Planck and Schr""odinger equations. Two examples are used to illustrate the method. In the first example the drift coefficient depends only on time but not on space. In the second example we consider the Uhlenbeck-Ornstein process with a small drift coefficient. These examples show that the such perturbative approach can be a useful tool to obtain approximate solutions of Fokker-Planck equations with constant diffusion coefficients.","110"
"A binary poset code of codimension M of cardinality 2N-M, where N is the code length can correct maximum M errors. All possible poset metrics that allow codes of codimension M to be M-, M-1- or M-2-perfect are described. Some general conditions on a poset which guarantee the nonexistence of perfect poset codes are derived; as examples, we prove the nonexistence of R-perfect poset codes for some R in the case of the crown poset and in the case of the union of disjoin chains. Index terms: perfect codes, poset codes","100"
"It is well established that mass loss from AGB stars due to dust driven winds cannot be arbitrarily low. We model the mass loss from carbon rich AGB stars using detailed frequency-dependent radiation hydrodynamics including dust formation. We present a study of the thresholds for the mass loss rate as a function of stellar parameters based on a subset of a larger grid of such models and compare these results to previous observational and theoretical work. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of the pulsation mechanism and dust formation for the creation of a stellar wind and how it affects these thresholds and briefly discuss the consequences for stellar evolution.","115"
"A spinel related oxide, Na4Ir3O8, was found to have a three dimensional network of corner shared Ir4 t2g5 triangles. This gives rise to an antiferromagnetically coupled S  12 spin system formed on a geometrically frustrated hyperkagome lattice. Magnetization M and magnetic specific heat Cm data showed the absence of long range magnetic ordering at least down to 2 K. The large Cm at low temperatures is independent of applied magnetic field up to 12 T, in striking parallel to the behavior seen in triangular and kagome antiferromagnets reported to have a spin-liquid ground state. These results strongly suggest that the ground state of Na4Ir3O8 is a three dimensional manifestation of a spin liquid.","120"
"We study experimentally the collective motion of grains inside a U shaped tube undergoing vertical oscillations, and we develop a very simple quantitative model that captures relevant features of the observed behaviour. The height difference between the granular columns grows with time when the system is shaken at sufficiently low frequencies. The system exhibits two types of growth: exponentially divergent type I and exponentially saturating type II, depending on the size of the grains. The type I growth can be quenched by removing the air whereas the type II behavior can occur in the absence of air. There is a good agreement between the model proposed and our experimental results.","118"
"Polygonal chains are fundamental objects in many applications like pattern recognition and protein structure alignment. A well-known measure to characterize the similarity of two polygonal chains is the famous Frechet distance. In this paper, for the first time, we consider the Voronoi diagram of polygonal chains in d-dimension d2,3 under the discrete Frechet distance. Given n polygonal chains cal C in d-dimension d2,3, each with at most k vertices, we prove fundamental properties of such a Voronoi diagram em VD_Fcal C by presenting the first known upper and lower bounds for em VD_Fcal C.","102"
"We present calculations on the magnetocapacitance of the two-dimensional electron gas in a lateral semiconductor superlattice under two-dimensional weak periodic potential modulation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. Adopting a Gaussian broadening of magnetic-field-dependent width in the density of states, we present explicit and simple expressions for the magnetocapacitance, valid for the relevant weak magnetic fields and modulation strengths. As the modulation strength in both directions increase, beats of the magnetocapacitance oscillations are observed, in the low magnetic field range Weiss-oscillations regime, which are absent in the one-dimensional weak modulation case.","101"
"The three-dimensional instability of two coupled electromagnetic waves in an unmagnetized plasma is investigated theoretically and numerically. In the regime of two-plasmon decay, where one pump wave frequency is approximately twice the electron plasma frequency, we find that the coupled pump waves give rise to enhanced instability with wave vectors between those of the two beams. In the case of ion parametric decay instability, where the pump wave decays into one Langmuir wave and one ion acoustic wave, the instability regions are added with no distinct amplification. Our investigation can be useful in interpreting laser-plasma as well as ionospheric heating experiments.","109"
"We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio SNR of the stochastic gravitational-wave background in an extreme case that its spectrum has a sharp falloff with its amplitude close to the detection threshold. Such a spectral feature is a characteristic imprint of the change in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom on the stochastic background generated during inflation in the early Universe. We find that, although SNR is maximal with the correct template which is proportional to the assumed real spectrum, its sensitivity to the shape of template is fairly weak indicating that a simple power-law template is sufficient to detect the signature.","106"
"We derive an explicit expression for the Fourier-Laplace transform of the two-point distribution function px_1,t_1;x_2,t_2 of a continuous time random walk CTRW, thus generalizing the result of Montroll and Weiss for the single point distribution function px_1,t_1. The multi-point distribution function has a structure of a convolution of the Montroll-Weiss CTRW and the aging CTRW single point distribution functions. The correlation function xt_1 xt_2  for the biased CTRW process is found. The random walk foundation of the multi-time-space fractional diffusion equation Baule and Friedrich em Europhysics Letters bf 77 10002 2007 is investigated using the unbiased CTRW in the continuum limit.","114"
"The family of metric operators, constructed by Musumbu sl et al 2007 sl J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. bf 40 F75, for a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian augmented by a non-Hermitian cal PT-symmetric part, is re-examined in the light of an su1,1 approach. An alternative derivation, only relying on properties of su1,1 generators, is proposed. Being independent of the realization considered for the latter, it opens the way towards the construction of generalized non-Hermitian not necessarily cal PT-symmetric oscillator Hamiltonians related by similarity to Hermitian ones. Some examples of them are reviewed.","105"
"We provide a mathematical analysis of appearance of the concentrations as Dirac masses of the solution to a Fokker-Planck system with asymmetric potentials. This problem has been proposed as a model to describe motor proteins moving along molecular filaments. The components of the system describe the densities of the different conformations of the proteins. Our results are based on the study of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation arising, at the zero diffusion limit, after an exponential transformation change of the phase function that rises a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We consider different classes of conformation transitions coefficients bounded, unbounded and locally vanishing.","106"
"It does not seem to have been observed previously that the classical Bernstein polynomials B_Nfx are closely related to the Bergman-Szego kernels Pi_N for the Fubini-Study metric on CP1: B_Nfx is the Berezin symbol of the Toeplitz operator Pi_N fN-1 D_theta. The relation suggests a generalization of Bernstein polynomials to any toric Kahler variety and Delzant polytope P. When f is smooth, B_Nfx admits a complete asymptotic expansion. Integrating it over P gives a complete asymptotic expansion for Dedekind-Riemann sums of smooth functions over lattice points in N P related to Euler-MacLaurin sum formulae of Guillemin-Sternberg and others.","103"
"In the first part of this paper, we present a set of simple arguments to show that the two-dimensional gauge anomaly and the 21-dimensional Lorentz symmetry determine the leading Gaussian term in the vacuum wave function of 21-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. This is to highlight the robustness of the wave function and its relative insensitivity to the choice of regularizations. We then comment on the correspondence with the explicit calculations done in earlier papers. We also make some comments on the nature of the gauge-invariant configuration space for Euclidean three-dimensional gauge fields relevant to 31-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.","101"
"We propose noise oscillation measurements in a double point contact, accessible with current technology, to seek for a signature of the non-abelian nature of the nu52 quantum Hall state. Calculating the voltage and temperature dependence of the current and noise oscillations, we predict the non-abelian nature to materialize through a multiplicity of the possible outcomes: two qualitatively different frequency dependences of the nonzero interference noise. Comparison between our predictions for the Moore-Read state with experiments on nu52 will serve as a much needed test for the nature of the nu52 quantum Hall state.","100"
"The accuracy and precision of current atom-interferometric inertialsensors rival state-of-the-art conventional devices using artifact-based test masses . Atomic sensors are well suited for fundamental measurements of gravito-inertial fields. The sensitivity required to test gravitational theories can be achieved by extending the baseline of the interferometer. The I.C.E. Interf'erom'etrie Coh'erente pour l'Espace interferometer aims to achieve long interrogation times in compact apparatus via reduced gravity. We have tested a cold-atom source during airplane parabolic flights. We show that this environment is compatible with free-fall interferometric measurements using up to 4 second interrogation time. We present the next-generation apparatus using degenerate gases for low release-velocity atomic sources in space-borne experiments.","115"
"C-endomorphisms arising from superselection structures with non-trivial centre define a 'rank' and a 'first Chern class'. Crossed products by such endomorphisms involve the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of a vector bundle having the above-mentioned rank and first Chern class, and can be used to construct a duality for abstract nonsymmetric tensor categories vs. group bundles acting on nonsymmetric Hilbert bimodules. Existence and unicity of the dual object i.e., the 'gauge' group bundle are not ensured: we give a description of this phenomenon in terms of a certain moduli space associated with the given endomorphism. The above-mentioned Hilbert bimodules are noncommutative analogues of gauge-equivariant vector bundles in the sense of Nistor-Troitsky.","118"
"We consider the transport through a system of three coupled quantum dots in a perpendicular magnetic field. At zero field, destructive interference can trap an electron in a dark state -- a coherent superposition of dot states that completely blocks current flow. The magnetic field can disrupt this interference giving rise to oscillations in the current and its higher-order statistics as the field is increased. These oscillations have a period of either the flux-quantum or half the flux-quantum, depending on the dot geometry. We give results for the stationary current and for the shotnoise and skewness at zero and finite frequency.","108"
"In this paper we re-investigate the core of Schroedinger's 'cat paradox'. We argue that one has to distinguish clearly between superpositions of macroscopic cat states and superpositions of entangled states which comprise both the state of the cat. It is shown, that in the first instance recurrence to decoherence or other mechanisms is not necessary in this special case in order to explain the absence of macroscopic superpositions. Additionally, we present modified versions of two quantum optical experiments as experimenta crucis. Applied rigorously, quantum mechanical formalism reduces the problem to a mere pseudo-paradox.","103"
"We report that a novel type of superconducting order parameter has been realized in the ferromagnetic states in UGe_2 via 73Ge nuclear-quadrupole-resonance NQR experiments performed under pressure P. Measurements of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1T_1 have revealed an unconventional nature of superconductivity such that the up-spin band is gapped with line nodes, but the down-spin band remains gapless at the Fermi level. This result is consistent with that of a ferromagnetic spin-pairing model in which Cooper pairs are formed among ferromagnetically polarized electrons. The present experiment has shed new light on a possible origin of ferromagnetic superconductivity, which is mediated by ferromagnetic spin-density fluctuations relevant to the first-order transition inside the ferromagnetic states.","119"
"To investigate how quantum effects might modify special relativity, we will study a Lorentz transformation between classical and quantum reference frames and express it in terms of the four-dimensional 4D momentum of the quantum reference frame. The transition from the classical expression of the Lorentz transformation to a quantum-mechanical one requires us to symmetrize the expression and replace all its dynamical variables with the corresponding operators, from which we can obtain the same conclusion as that from quantum field theory given by Weinberg's formula: owing to the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, a particle as a quantum reference frame can propagate over a spacelike interval.","111"
"The mass spectra of the excited heavy baryons consisting of two light u,d,s and one heavy c,b quarks are calculated in the heavy-quark--light-diquark approximation within the constituent quark model. The light quarks, forming the diquark, and the light diquark in the baryon are treated completely relativistically. The expansion in vc up to the second order is used only for the heavy b and c quarks. The internal structure of the diquark is taken into account by inserting the diquark-gluon interaction form factor. An overall good agreement of the obtained predictions with available experimental data is found.","111"
"We use a functional approach to study various aspects of the quantum effective dynamics of moving, planar, dispersive mirrors, coupled to scalar or Dirac fields, in different numbers of dimensions. We first compute the Euclidean effective action, and use it to derive the imaginary part of the in-out' effective action. We also obtain, for the case of the real scalar field in 11 dimensions, the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action and a semiclassical Langevin equation that describes the motion of the mirror including noise and dissipative effects due to its coupling to the quantum fields.","104"
"We have studied charge transport in a one-dimensional chain of small Josephson junctions using a single-electron transistor. We observe a crossover from time-correlated tunneling of single electrons to that of Cooper pairs as a function of both magnetic field and current. At relatively high magnetic field, single-electron transport dominates and the tunneling frequency is given by fIe, where I is the current through the chain and e is the electron's charge. As the magnetic field is lowered, the frequency gradually shifts to fI2e for I200 fA, indicating Cooper-pair transport. For the parameters of the measured sample, we expect the Cooper-pair transport to be incoherent.","115"
"We study and solve the ground-state problem of a microscopic model for a family of orbitally degenerate quantum magnets. The orbital degrees of freedom are assumed to have directional character and are represented by static Potts-like variables. In the limit of vanishing Hund's coupling, the ground-state manifold of such a model is spanned by the hard-core dimer spin singlet coverings of the lattice. The extensive degeneracy of dimer coverings is lifted at a finite Hund's coupling through an order-out-of-disorder mechanism by virtual triplet excitations. The relevance of our results to several experimentally studied systems is discussed.","104"
"We examine the maximum negative energy density which can be attained in various quantum states of a massless scalar field. We consider states in which either one or two modes are excited, and show that the energy density can be given in terms of a small number of parameters. We calculate these parameters for several examples of superposition states for one mode, and entangled states for two modes, and find the maximum magnitude of the negative energy density in these states. We consider several states which have been, or potentially will be, generated in quantum optics experiments.","106"
"Black holes behave as thermodynamic systems, and a central task of any quantum theory of gravity is to explain these thermal properties. A statistical mechanical description of black hole entropy once seemed remote, but today we suffer an embarrassment of riches: despite counting very different states, many inequivalent approaches to quantum gravity obtain identical results. Such universality'' may reflect an underlying two-dimensional conformal symmetry near the horizon, which can be powerful enough to control the thermal characteristics independent of other details of the theory. This picture suggests an elegant description of the relevant degrees of freedom as Goldstone-boson-like excitations arising from symmetry breaking by the conformal anomaly.","117"
"Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy describing the normal state to Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell LOFF state transition, we evaluate the free energy of seven most common lattice structures such as stripe, square, triangular,Simple Cubic SC, Face centered Cubic FCC,Body centered Cubic BCC and Quasi-crystal QC. We find that the stripe phase which is the original LO state, is the most stable phase. This result maybe relevant to the detection of LOFF state in some heavy fermion compounds and the pairing lattice structure of fermions with unequal populations in the BCS side of Feshbach resonance in ultra-cold atoms.","107"
"We develop a method for measuring and localizing homology classes. This involves two problems. First, we define relevant notions of size for both a homology class and a homology group basis, using ideas from relative homology. Second, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal homology basis, using techniques from persistent homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the computed optimal basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The algorithm runs in Obeta4 n3 log2 n time, where n is the size of the simplicial complex and beta is the Betti number of the homology group.","108"
"Forward-backward correlation in pp collisions is studied in an approach that emphasizes the partonic scattering angles and circumvents the intractable problem related to the transverse momenta that are low. Assuming the back-to-back scattering of partons to be the origin of hadronic correlation, the properties of forward-backward multiplicity covariance can be derived essentially independent of details of hadronization. The range of correlation in pseudo-rapidity emerges from the study without any dynamical input, thus dispelling the notion that correlation length has any fundamental significance. An attempt is made to relate the results to the two-component structure seen in autocorrelation.","103"
"Anomalies of discrete R-symmetries appearing in heterotic orbifold models are studied. We find that the mixed anomalies for different gauge groups satisfy the universal Green-Schwarz GS condition, indicating that these anomalies are canceled by the GS mechanism. An exact relation between the anomaly coefficients of the discrete R-symmetries and one-loop beta-function coefficients is obtained. We also find that the discrete R-symmetries have a good chance to be unbroken down to the supersymmetry breaking scale. Even below this scale a Z_2 subgroup is unbroken, which may be an origin of the R-parity of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Relations between the R-symmetry anomalies and T-duality anomalies are also investigated.","116"
"We study supersymmetric QCD in the conformal window as a laboratory for unparticle physics, and analyze couplings between the unparticle sector and the Higgs sector. These couplings can lead to the unparticle sector being pushed away from its scale invariant fixed point. We show that this implies that low energy experiments will not be able to see unparticle physics, and the best hope of seeing unparticles is in high energy collider experiments such as the Tevatron and the LHC. We also demonstrate how the breaking of scale invariance could be observed at these experiments.","100"
"We compute, in the MSSM framework, the sum of the one-loop electroweak and of the total QED radiation effects for the process pp to t WX, initiated by the parton process bgto tW. Combining these terms with the existing NLO calculations of SM and SUSY QCD corrections, we analyze the overall one-loop supersymmetric effects on the partial rates of the process, obtained by integrating the differential cross section up to a final variable invariant mass. We conclude that, for some choices of the SUSY parameters and for relatively small final invariant masses, they could reach the relative ten percent level, possibly relevant for a dedicated experimental effort at LHC.","120"
"The OPERA experiment, designed to conclusively prove the existence of rm nu_mu to nu_tau oscillations in the atmospheric sector, makes use of a massive lead-nuclear emulsion target to observe the appearance of rm nu_tau's in the CNGS rm nu_mu beam.

"The upper limit on the mass of the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model is around 135 GeV for soft supersymmetry breaking masses in the 1 TeV range. We demonstrate that this upper limit may be sizably relaxed if supersymmetry is embedded in extra dimensions. We calculate, using the effective potential technique, the radiative corrections to the lightest Higgs mass induced by the Kaluza-Klein towers of quarks and squarks with one and two compactified directions. We observe that the lightest Higgs may comfortably weigh around 200 GeV 300 GeV with one two extra dimensions.","104"
"The studies of the generalized Einstein Lagrangian densities without torsion are extended to those of the more generalized Lagrangian densities with torsion. The properties of the more generalized Lagrangian densities are studied systematically and thoroughly. The dynamical laws of a gravitational system such as the gravitational field equations, the conservation laws of the energy-momentum tensor densities, the conservation laws of the spin densities and the equations of motion for test particle are all derived from the Lagrangian densities. The differences between the more generalized Lagrangian densities and the generalized Einstein Lagrangian densities are discussed.","100"
"Some of the theoretical challenges posed by the general relativistic description of binary systems of compact objects neutron stars or black holes are reviewed. We recall the various ways one can use the theory of the motion, and of the timing, of binary pulsars to test the strong-field andor radiative aspects of General Relativity. Recent advances in the theory of the motion and radiation of binary black holes are discussed. One emphasizes the usefulness of the Effective One Body approach in providing a quasi-analytical description of the waveform emitted by coalescing binary black holes.","100"
"For symplectic group actions which are not Hamiltonian there are two ways to define reduction. Firstly using the cylinder-valued momentum map and secondly lifting the action to any Hamiltonian cover such as the universal cover, and then performing symplectic reduction in the usual way. We show that provided the action is free and proper, and the Hamiltonian holonomy associated to the action is closed, the natural projection from the latter to the former is a symplectic cover. At the same time we give a classification of all Hamiltonian covers of a given symplectic group action. The main properties of the lifting of a group action to a cover are studied.","118"
"In this work we derive an analytic expression for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of dilute wet granular matter, valid for any spatial dimension. The grains are modelled as hard spheres and the influence of the wetting liquid is described according to the Capillary Model, in which dissipation is due to the hysteretic cohesion force of capillary bridges. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is expanded in a series with respect to density. We find a rapid increase of the leading term when liquid is added. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the granular dynamics to humidity, and shows that the liquid significantly increases the chaoticity of the granular gas.","112"
"In Lagrangian turbulence one is faced with the puzzle that 2D Navier-Stokes flows are nearly as intermittent as in three dimensions although no intermittency is present in the inverse cascade in 2D Eulerian turbulence. In addition, an inertial range is very difficult to detect and it is questionable whether it exists at all. Here, we investigate the transition of Eulerian to Lagrangian probability density functions PDFs which leads to a new type of Lagrangian structure function. This possesses an extended inertial range similar to the case of tracer particles in a frozen turbulent velocity field. This allows a connection to the scaling of Eulerian transversal structure functions.","114"
"An almost Belyi covering is an algebraic covering of the projective line, such that all ramified points except one simple ramified point lie above a set of 3 points of the projective line. In general, there are 1-dimensional families of these coverings with a fixed ramification pattern. That is, Hurwitz spaces for these coverings are curves. In this paper, three almost Belyi coverings of degrees 11, 12, and 20 are explicitly constructed. We demonstrate how these coverings can be used for computation of several algebraic solutions of the sixth Painleve equation.","102"

"The NA60 experiment at the CERN SPS has studied low-mass muon pairs in 158 AGeV In-In collisions. A strong excess of pairs is observed above the yield expected from neutral meson decays. The unprecedented sample size of close to 400K events and the good mass resolution of about 2 have made it possible to isolate the excess by subtraction of the decay sources keeping the rho. The shape of the resulting mass spectrum exhibits considerable broadening, but essentially no shift in mass. The acceptance-corrected transverse-momentum spectra have a shape atypical for radial flow and show a significant mass dependence, pointing to different sources in different mass regions.","114"
"Configurations of rigid collections of saddle connections are connected component invariants for strata of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. They have been classified for strata of Abelian differentials by Eskin, Masur and Zorich. Similar work for strata of quadratic differentials has been done in Masur and Zorich, although in that case the connected components were not distinguished. We classify the configurations for quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere and on hyperelliptic connected components of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. We show that, in genera greater than five, any configuration that appears in the hyperelliptic connected component of a stratum also appears in the non-hyperelliptic one.","116"
"We present a solid state implementation of quantum computation, which improves previously proposed optically driven schemes. Our proposal is based on vertical arrays of quantum dots embedded in a mesoporous material which can be fabricated with present technology. The redundant encoding typical of the chosen hardware protects the computation against gate errors and the effects of measurement induced noise. The system parameters required for quantum computation applications are calculated for II-VI and III-V materials and found to be within the experimental range. The proposed hardware may help minimize errors due to polydispersity of dot sizes, which is at present one of the main problems in relation to quantum dot-based quantum computation.","118"

"We calculate the quantum radiation from the five dimensional charged rotating black rings by demanding the radiation to eliminate the possible anomalies on the horizons. It is shown that the temperature, energy flux and angular-momentum flux exactly coincide with those of the Hawking radiation. The black rings considered in this paper contain the Myers-Perry black hole as a limit and the quantum radiation for this black hole, obtained in the literature, is recovered in the limit. The results support the picture that the Hawking radiation can be regarded as the anomaly eliminator on horizons and suggest its general applicability to the higher-dimensional black holes discovered recently.","113"
"We study the appearance of anomalies of the Master Ward Identity, which is a universal renormalization condition in perturbative QFT. The main insight of the present paper is that any violation of the Master Ward Identity can be expressed as a LOCAL interacting field; this is a version of the well-known Quantum Action Principle of Lowenstein and Lam. Proceeding in a proper field formalism by induction on the order in hbar, this knowledge about the structure of possible anomalies as well as techniques of algebraic renormalization are used to remove possible anomalies by finite renormalizations. As an example the method is applied to prove the Ward identities of the ON scalar field model.","120"
"The Atiyah-Singer index theorem is generalized to a two-dimensional SO3 Yang-Mills-Higgs YMH system. The generalized theorem is proven by using the heat kernel method and a nonlinear realization of SU2 gauge symmetry. This theorem is applied to the problem of deriving a charge quantization condition in the four-dimensional SO3 YMH system with non-Abelian monopoles. The resulting quantization condition, egn n: integer, for an electric charge e and a magnetic charge g is consistent with that found by Arafune, Freund and Goebel. It is shown that the integer n is half of the index of a Dirac operator.","106"
"For a Kahler manifold X, we study a space of test functions W which is a complex version of H1. We prove for W the classical results of the theory of Dirichlet spaces: the functions in W are defined up to a pluripolar set and the functional capacity associated to W tests the pluripolar sets. This functional capacity is a Choquet capacity. The space W is not reflexive and the smooth functions are not dense in it for the strong topology. So the classical tools of potential theory do not apply here. We use instead pluripotential theory and Dirichlet spaces associated to a current.","112"
"1f noise in current biased La0.82Ca0.18MnO3 crystals has been investigated. The temperature dependence of the noise follows the resistivity changes with temperature suggesting that resistivity fluctuations constitute a fixed fraction of the total resistivity, independently of the dissipation mechanism and magnetic state of the system. The noise scales as a square of the current as expected for equilibrium resistivity fluctuations. However, at 77 K at bias exceeding some threshold, the noise intensity starts to decrease with increasing bias. The appearance of nonequilibrium noise is interpreted in terms of bias dependent multi-step indirect tunneling.","101"
"The possible connection between High-T_c superconductivity and quantum chromodynamics is considered that is based on two interacting Ginzburg-Landau equations. For High-T_c superconductivity these two equations describe Cooper electrons interacting with different kind of quasi particles phonons, magnons, excitons and so on. The interaction term describes a possible interaction between different kind of quasi particles. For quantum chromodynamics the equations describe two kinds of gauge condensates. The condensates describe a gauge potential from a subalgebra of the SU3 gauge group and the corresponding coset. Regular solutions are found which describe the situation where one field, psi_1, is pushed out by another, psi_2.","112"
"The nature of polyamorphism and amorphous-to-amorphous transition is investigated by means of an exactly solvable model with quenched disorder, the spherical sp multi-spin interaction model. The analysis is carried out in the framework of Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and leads to the identification of low temperature glass phases of different kinds. Besides the usual one-step' solution, known to reproduce all basic properties of structural glasses, also a physically consistent two-step' solution arises. More complicated phases are found as well, as temperature is further decreased, expressing a complex variety of metastable states structures for amorphous systems.","106"
"We analyze the non-Gaussianity for primordial curvature perturbations generated in multi-scalar slow-roll inflation model including the model with non-separable potential by making use of delta N formalism. Many authors have investigated the possibility of large non-Gaussianity for the models with separable potential, and they have found that the non-linear parameter, f_NL, is suppressed by the slow-roll parameters. We show that for the non-separable models f_NL is given by the product of a factor which is suppressed by the slow-roll parameters and a possible enhancement factor which is given by exponentials of quantities of O1.","100"
"We present a Monte-Carlo MC calculation of the propagation of cosmic ray protons in the Galaxy for energies above 1 PeV. We discuss the relative strengths of competing effects such as parallelperpendicular diffusion and drifts in toy models of the Galaxy. We compare our estimates with the results of the MC calculation for the toy models and then we apply the MC calculation to a few more realistic models of the Galactic magnetic field. We study the containment times in different models of the magnetic field in order to understand which one may be consistent with the low energy data.","104"
"Dissipation of magnetic fields in Hall plasma of neutron star crusts may power persistent high energy emission of a class of strongly magnetized neutrons stars, magnetars. We consider development of a dissipative tearing mode in Hall plasma electron MHD and find that its growth rate increases with the wave number of perturbations, reaching a maximum value intermediate between resistive tau_r and Hall times tau_H, Gammasim 1  sqrttau_r tau_H. We argue that the tearing mode may be the principal mechanism by which strong magnetic fields are dissipated in magnetars on times scale of sim 104-105 yrs powering the persistent X-ray emisison.","106"
"The averaged null energy condition ANEC requires that the integral over a complete null geodesic of the stress-energy tensor projected onto the geodesic tangent vector is never negative. This condition is sufficient to prove many important theorems in general relativity, but it is violated by quantum fields in curved spacetime. However there is a weaker condition, which is free of known violations, requiring only that there is no self-consistent space-time in semiclassical gravity in which ANEC is violated on a complete, em achronal null geodesic. We indicate why such a condition might be expected to hold and show that it is sufficient to rule out wormholes and closed timelike curves.","118"
"Under the general hypotheses of locality, smoothness of interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, we investigate the cross-couplings of one or several spin-two fields to a massless p-form. Two complementary cases arise. The first case is related to the standard interactions from General Relativity, but the second case describes a new, special type of couplings in Dp2 spacetime dimensions, which break the PT-invariance. Nevertheless, no consistent, indirect cross-interactions among different gravitons with a positively defined metric in internal space can be constructed.","109"
"We present a new design of dielectric microcavities supporting modes with large quality factors and highly directional light emission. The key idea is to place a point scatterer inside a dielectric circular microdisk. We show that, depending on the position and strength of the scatterer, this leads to strongly directional modes in various frequency regions while preserving the high Q-factors reminiscent of the whispering gallery modes of the microdisk without scatterer. The design is very appealing due to its simplicity, promising a cleaner experimental realisation than previously studied microcavity designs on the one hand and analytic tractability based on Green's function techniques and self-adjoint extension theory on the other.","117"
"For infinitely large sparse networks of spiking neurons mean field theory shows that a balanced state of highly irregular activity arises under various conditions. Here we analytically investigate the microscopic irregular dynamics in finite networks of arbitrary connectivity, keeping track of all individual spike times. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we demonstrate that the irregular dynamics is not chaotic but rather stable and convergent towards periodic orbits. Moreover, every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical systems is stable. These results highlight that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally capable of generating irregular activity.","101"
"Continuous variable entanglement is a manifestation of nonclassicality of quantum states. In this paper we attempt to analyze whether and under which conditions nonclassicality can be used as an entanglement criterion. We adopt the well-accepted definition of nonclassicality in the form of lack of well-defined positive Glauber Sudarshan P-function describing the state. After demonstrating that the classicality of subsystems is not sufficient for the nonclassicality of the overall state to be identifiable with entanglement, we focus on Gaussian states and find specific local unitary transformations required to arrive at this equivalency. This is followed by the analysis of quantitative relation between nonclassicality and entanglement.","110"
"The aim of this contribution is to give the explicit formulas for the eigenvectors of the transfer-matrix of Baxter-Bazhanov-Stroganov BBS model N-state spin model with fixed-spin boundary conditions. These formulas are obtained by a limiting procedure from the formulas for the eigenvectors of periodic BBS model. The latter formulas were derived in the framework of the Sklyanin's method of separation of variables. In the case of fixed-spin boundaries the corresponding T-Q Baxter equations for the functions of separated variables are solved explicitly. As a particular case we obtain the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian of Ising-like Z_N quantum chain model.","105"
"We consider a generalization of the one-dimensional t-J model with anisotropic spin-spin interactions. We show that the anisotropy leads to an effective attractive interaction between the spinon and holon excitations, resulting in a localized bound state. Detailed quantitative analytic predictions for the dependence of the binding energy on the anisotropy are presented, and verified by precise numerical simulations. The binding energy is found to interpolate smoothly between a finite value in the t-Jz limit and zero in the isotropic limit, going to zero exponentially in the vicinity of the latter. We identify changes in spinon dispersion as the primary factor for this non-trivial behavior.","112"
"The equilibrium free energy landscape of an off-lattice model protein as a function of an internal reaction coordinate is reconstructed from out-of-equilibrium mechanical unfolding manipulations. This task is accomplished via two independent methods: by employing an extended version of the Jarzynski equality EJE and the protein inherent structures ISs. In a range of temperatures around the folding transition'' we find a good quantitative agreement between the free energies obtained via EJE and IS approaches. This indicates that the two methodologies are consistent and able to reproduce equilibrium properties of the examined system. Moreover, for the studied model the structural transitions induced by pulling can be related to thermodynamical aspects of folding.","119"
"We demonstrate how the observed H2O ice column densities toward three dense globules in the Southern Coalsack could be used to constrain the ages of these sources. We derive ages of 105 yr, in agreement with dynamical studies of these objects. We have modelled the chemical evolution of the globules, and show how the molecular abundances are controlled by both the gas density and the initial chemical conditions as the globules formed. Based on our derived ages, we predict the column densities of several species of interest. These predictions should be straightforward to test by performing molecular line observations","106"
"We have introduced a notion of C-symbolic dynamical system in K. Matsumoto: Actions of symbolic dynamical systems on C-algebras, to appear in J. Reine Angew. Math., that is a finite family of endomorphisms of a C-algebra with some conditions. The endomorphisms are indexed by symbols and yield both a subshift and a C-algebra of a Hilbert C-bimodule. The associated C-algebra with the C-symbolic dynamical system is regarded as a crossed product by the subshift. We will study a simplicity condition of the C-algebras of the C-symbolic dynamical systems. Some examples such as irrational rotation Cuntz-Krieger algebras will be studied.","108"
"We measure the relative abundances of strange mesons, baryons, and anti-baryons correlated with high-p_T trigger particles in 197Au  197Au collisions at sqrts_NN  200 GeV. Particle yields and ratios are extracted on the near-side and away-side of the trigger particle. The associate-particle ratios are studied as a function of the angle relative to the trigger particle azimuth Deltaphi. Such studies should help elucidate the origin of the previously observed correlations and their strong modifications in AuAu collisions relative to pp collisions. We discuss how these measurements might be related to several scenarios for interactions of fast partons with the medium in AuAu collision.","109"
"We investigate the role of long range ferromagnetic order in the electronic structure of Sr_1-xCa_xRuO_3 using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. SrRuO_3 is a ferromagnetic metal but isostructural, isoelectronic CaRuO_3 is an enhanced paramagnet. Surface spectra of CaRuO_3 exhibit temperature induced modifications. This is not significant in other compositions. This may be attributed to the structural changes observed in previous studies. Interestingly, the bulk spectra reveal unusual spectral changes exhibiting large decrease in the coherent feature intensity corresponding to only ferromagnetic samples, although the Ru moment is very similar in all the compositions.","101"
"Within the framework of Lorentz-violating extended electrodynamics, the Dirac equation for a bound electron in an external electromagnetic field is considered assuming the interaction with a CPT-odd axial vector background b_mu. The quasi-relativistic Hamiltonian is obtained using a 1c-series expansion. Relativistic Dirac eigenstates in a spherically-symmetric potential are found accurate up to the second order in b_0. b_0-induced CPT-odd corrections to the electromagnetic dipole moment operators of a bound electron are calculated that contribute to the anapole moment of the atomic orbital and may cause a specific asymmetry of the angular distribution of the radiation of a hydrogen atom.","104"
"We investigate the temperature evolution of the electronic structure of ferromagnetic CaB_6 using ultra-high resolution photoemission spectroscopy; electronic structure of paramagnetic LaB_6 is used as a reference. High resolution spectra of CaB_6 reveal finite density of states at the Fermi level, epsilon_F at all the temperatures and evidence of impurity induced localized features in the vicinity of epsilon_F, which are absent in the spectra of LaB_6. Analysis of the high resolution spectra suggests that disorder in B-sublattice inducing partial localization in the mobile electrons and low electron density at epsilon_F is important to achieve ferromagnetism in these systems.","104"
"There is an intense debate in the recent literature about the correct generalization of Maxwell's velocity distribution in special relativity. The most frequently discussed candidate distributions include the Juettner function as well as modifications thereof. Here, we report results from fully relativistic one-dimensional 1D molecular dynamics MD simulations that resolve the ambiguity. The numerical evidence unequivocally favors the Juettner distribution. Moreover, our simulations illustrate that the concept of 'thermal equilibrium' extends naturally to special relativity only if a many-particle system is spatially confined. They make evident that 'temperature' can be statistically defined and measured in an observer frame independent way.","111"
"We present 30 GHz Sunyaev Zel'dovich SZ observations of a sample of four galaxy clusters with a prototype of the One Centimetre Receiver Array OCRA-p which is mounted on the Torun 32-m telescope. The clusters Cl001616, MS0451.6-0305, MS1054.4-0321 and Abell 2218 are popular SZ targets and serve as commissioning observations. All four are detected with clear significance 4-6 sigma and values for the central temperature decrements are in good agreement with measurements reported in the literature. We believe that systematic effects are successfully suppressed by our observing strategy. The relatively short integration times required to obtain these results demonstrate the power of OCRA-p and its successors for future SZ studies.","117"
"The NA60 experiment is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS. It has measured the dimuon yield in Indium--Indium collisions with an In beam of 158 AGeVc and in p-A collisions with a proton beam of 400 and 158 AGeVc. The results allow to address three important physics topics, namely the study of the rho spectral function in nuclear collisions, the clarification of the origin of the dimuon excess measured by NA50 in the intermediate mass range, and the Jpsi suppression pattern in a collision system different from Pb-Pb. An overview of these results will be given in this paper.","109"
"A simple model to describe the energetic phase diagram of electron-doped cuprate superconductor is developed. Interband pairing operates between the UHB and the defect states created by doping and supplied by both extincting HB-s. Two defect subbands correspond to the pi, 0 and pi 2,pi 2 momentum regions. Extended doping quenches the bare normal state gaps pseudogaps. Maximal transition temperature corresponds to overlapping bands ensemble intersected by the chemical potential. Illustrative results for T_c, pseudo- and superconducting gaps are calculated on the whole doping scale. Major characteristics features on the phase diagram are reproduced. Anticipated manifestation of gaps doping dynamics is discussed.","113"
"Multi-strange baryon azimuthal correlations were observed in dAu and AuAu data taken by the STAR detector at RHIC. We extract the same-side per-trigger yields for a variety of strange particle species and trigger pt, but do not observe any species dependence. We also report the observation of an elongation in the Delta-eta; direction of the Xi correlation peak, the ridge. Comparing the same-side yields in dAu and AuAu data, we conclude that the same-side yield of the azimuthal-only Xi correlations is greatly enhanced by the ridge yield. We also report the first observation of a strong same-side peak in the Omega baryon triggered azimuthal correlations.","114"
"From the spectral plot of the normalized graph Laplacian, the essential qualitative properties of a network can be simultaneously deduced. Given a class of empirical networks, reconstruction schemes for elucidating the evolutionary dynamics leading to those particular data can then be developed. This method is exemplified for protein-protein interaction networks. Traces of their evolutionary history of duplication and divergence processes are identified. In particular, we can identify typical specific features that robustly distinguish protein-protein interaction networks from other classes of networks, in spite of possible statistical fluctuations of the underlying data.","100"
"We consider the stability of a compressible shear flow separating two streams of different speeds and temperatures. The velocity and temperature profiles in this mixing layer are hyperbolic tangents. The normal mode analysis of the flow stability reduces to an eigenvalue problem for the pressure perturbation. We briefly describe the numerical method that we used to solve this problem. Then, we introduce the notions of the absolute and convective instabilities and examine the effects of Mach number, and the velocity and temperature ratios of each stream on the transition between convective and absolute instabilities. Finally, we discuss the implication of the results presented in this paper for the heliopause stability.","119"
"We address the discrepancy between the Rosenbluth and polarization transfer data for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon. Assuming that the effect of two-photon corrections on the polarization transfer data is negligible, we obtain a model-independent estimate of the two-photon correction Delta2gamma. We analyze the polarization transfer data and the cross section data separately using dispersion relations. A central value as well as an error estimate for Delta2gamma is then obtained from a comparison of the two analyses. The resulting values for Delta2gamma are in good agreement with direct calculations available in the literature.","101"
"Some years ago, Cho and Vilenkin, introduced a model which presents topological solutions, despite not having degenerate vacua as is usually expected. Here we present a new model with topological defects, connecting degenerate vacua but which in a certain limit recovers precisely the one proposed originally by Cho and Vilenkin. In other words, we found a kind of parent model for the so called vacuumless model. Then the idea is extended to a model recently introduced by Bazeia et al. Finally, we trace some comments the case of the Liouville model.","102"
"We present a new fast algorithm which allows the simulation of ionising radiation emitted from point sources to be included in high-resolution three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formation. We employ a Str""omgren volume technique in which we use the densities of particles near the line-of-sight between the source and a given target particle to locate the ionisation front in the direction of the target. Along with one--dimensional tests, we present fully three--dimensional comparisons of our code with the three--dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, MOCASSIN, and show that we achieve good agreement, even in the case of highly complex density fields.","118"
"We have used the free expansion of ultracold neutral plasmas as a time-resolved probe of electron temperature. A combination of experimental measurements of the ion expansion velocity and numerical simulations characterize the crossover from an elastic-collision regime at low initial Gamma_e, which is dominated by adiabatic cooling of the electrons, to the regime of high Gamma_e in which inelastic processes drastically heat the electrons. We identify the time scales and relative contributions of various processes, and experimentally show the importance of radiative decay and disorder-induced electron heating for the first time in ultracold neutral plasmas.","101"
"We develop a fine-scale local analysis of measure entropy and measure sequence entropy based on combinatorial independence. The concepts of measure IE-tuples and measure IN-tuples are introduced and studied in analogy with their counterparts in topological dynamics. Local characterizations of the Pinsker von Neumann algebra and its sequence entropy analogue are given in terms of combinatorial independence, l_1 geometry, and Voiculescu's completely positive approximation entropy. Among the novel features of our local study is the treatment of general discrete acting groups, with the structural assumption of amenability in the case of entropy.","100"
"Energetically the single sheet of graphite graphene is more stable than the nanotube. The energy difference between the two systems can be directly related to the strain energy involved in rolling up the graphene sheet to form the nanotube. We have carried out first principle electronic structure calculations and evaluated the strain energy as a function of the nanotube radius. The dependence of the strain energy on the diameter of the nanotube has been found by several groups to be welldescribed by a continuum elasticity model. We attempt to examine why this is the case and show where atomistics enter the description.","107"
"We study the Casimir force in piston-like geometries semiclassically. The force on the piston is finite and physical, but to leading semiclassical approximation depends strongly on the shape of the surrounding cavity. Whereas this force is attractive for pistons in a parallelepiped with flat cylinder head, for which the semiclassical approximation by periodic orbits is exact, this approximation to the force on the piston vanishes for a semi-cylindrical head and becomes repulsive for a cylinder of circular cross section with a hemispherical head. In leading semiclassical approximation the sign of the force is related to the generalized Maslov index of short periodic orbits between the piston and its casing.","116"
"The computation of radiative energy loss in a dynamically screened QCD medium is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We calculate, to first order in the opacity, the energy loss suffered by a heavy quark traveling through an infinite and time-independent QCD medium and show that the result for a dynamical medium is almost twice that obtained previously for a medium consisting of randomly distributed static scattering centers. A quantitative description of jet suppression in RHIC and LHC experiments thus must correctly account for the dynamics of the medium's constituents.","105"
"We consider Khudaverdian's geometric version of a Batalin-Vilkovisky BV operator Delta_E in the case of a degenerate anti-Poisson manifold. The characteristic feature of such an operator aside from being a Grassmann-odd, nilpotent, second-order differential operator is that it sends semidensities to semidensities. We find a local formula for the Delta_E operator in arbitrary coordinates. As an important application of this setup, we consider the Dirac antibracket on an antisymplectic manifold with antisymplectic second-class constraints. We show that the entire Dirac construction, including the corresponding Dirac BV operator Delta_E_D, exactly follows from conversion of the antisymplectic second-class constraints into first-class constraints on an extended manifold.","115"
