When the probability is greater than 0, the event is likely to occur, and the probability of quot;impossiblequot; is 0. The 90 in the question is much greater than 0, which means that rain is possible. Even if the probability is very high, as long as it is non-zero, it still belongs to the category of quot;possiblequot;. Therefore, the correct answer is quot;possiblequot;. boxedPossible","119"
