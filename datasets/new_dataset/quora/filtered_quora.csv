"That margarine is healthier than butter is an old myth long since debunked. Today doctors urge people not to use margarine while suggesting they use butter sparingly. When I was a child it was different. Margarine was looked upon as the healthy alternative to butter. As a result my mother cooked with margarine constantly. Although in most respects my mother is an excellent cook she is currently in her mid-80s and still loves to cook growing up I learned to hate the taste of margarine. Thankfully, my mother stopped using it some time ago and I wont go near it. I stick to the mildly unhealthy butter. In moderation.","119"

"The statement for-profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies. tells me everything I need to know about you. What about patients and the sick? This is what we think healthcare is supposed to be about. Not fleecing as much money out of sick people's pockets as possible to improve the corporate bottom line. The idea that health-care is a business is sick and twisted. No doubt you are also claiming to be a Christian, but unlike me you have no idea of what that means.","102"

"IBMs processors on demand. Im not sure whether IBM still supports this, but back when I worked on IBMs server line, there was a feature called processors on demand. Basically, we would at times ship a system with more processor cores than the customer paid for.

"Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesnt keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the dropshipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the seller doesnt have to handle the product directly. The biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail model is that the selling merchant doesnt stock or own inventory.

"Without modern technology and imported crops and livestock, Australia doesnt lend itself well to settled agriculture, so most Aboriginal nations were nomadic, travelling around looking for whatever they could find that was edible. That meant their gear had to be light and easy to carry. They did build stone fish-traps, and paint elaborate designs in sheltered caves, but most of their tools and homes were made of wood and leather and bone for ease of transport. They were very good at large-scale land-management, though, and many Australian ecosystems would probably be quite different if they hadnt been.","108"

"How come religious intolerance towards Darwin's theory of evolution did not permeate as thoroughly or was not as socially significant as the religious reaction towards the theory in America? Probably because most parts of the civilized world have superior public education to that found in the USA, especially in the southern states.

Religious people in other parts of the world are more secure and can embrace modern knowledge while still hanging on to their religions.","106"

How ridiculously expensive real estate is compared with household income. The average household income in Mumbai is very low compared with any major European city.

But, understanding of any Bible Code must be done when your in prayer, fasting, sinless, holy and righteous. The Holy Bible is clear. No one knows the day or the time. So while one thing is seen hidden if it conflicts with the Holy Bible. Then it is not true or real. It is most likely a misunderstanding of the reading. Something may very well happen in 2021.

When the mixture is ignited, aluminum combines with oxygen in the air to form aluminum oxide, and liberates a lot of heat in the process. This heat melts the iron powder. So it is used in welding where welding rods are too small for the requirement. For example, joining two rails on a railway track by filling the gap between them using molten iron.

"Why dont online dating sites require a government photo ID upon registration for identity verification? If they did it, there would not be fake profiles. There are dating companies that require ID and that require showing up in person so that ID can be verified. Those companies are MUCH more expensive. Many would say that extra level of service is worth it. Once verified in person theres not much issue with having the rest of the process happen on line. So the answer to your fake profiles problem is simple. Pay a few thousand dollars to exclude the fakes.","108"
"Funny story It was about 11 a.m., I was barely awake, and I was second in line to order at Taco Bell. The couple in front of me were clearly meth heads. When the cashier asks what theyd like to order, the guy says, Wed like a Big Mac and a double quarter pounder with cheese and some fries. I stood there and wondered, when did Taco Bell start selling hamburgers? Then I hear the cashier say, This is Taco Bell. If you want hamburgers, youll have to go across the street to McDonalds. I laughed at the couple and myself!","115"
"I think I will change the way India obtained its Freedom from British. I think Satyagraha Non Cooperation employed as a tool to frustrate and evict British has unfortunately become a part of my country mans DNA so much so we don't even co-operate with our own elected Goverments. We have become a very indiciplined Nation. An Independence obtained thru war and even Gorilla Insurrection I belive would have made us a more disciplined Nation. May be we would have lost many lives but that would have been a worthy sacrifice. Who knows we could have avoided partion also. Sad we chose a wrong path to fight for our Freedom. Kannan.","120"

"I can only answer from my own experience but for me it depends on what exactly I am creating. For example, if I am creating an app that needs a button, or a text area for a score, or some other feature that I wont be moving, Ill probably use the storyboard to get it right where I want it. But everything can be done 100 programmatically and depending on what it is that you are doing, you may prefer to do it this way, rather than rely on the storyboard feature. Its really just a matter of personal preference. I hope this answers your question.","117"

"Space isnt cold, people are hot. As a result, they radiate close to 500 watts per square meter of surface area into the void unless protected by good insulation. Mostly in the form of far infrared. Since we only generate about 80100 watts of heat, brrrr! The Earth does the same thing; fortunately it absorbs roughly the same about of heat from the Sun in the daytime, so it stays in equilibrium, on average. Except when we mess with the escaping radiation via the Greenhouse Effect. This stuff is worth learning about!","105"

"The myth that we live in a classless society - where it is clear to everyone that the rich, andor historical ruling class can get away with anything short of murder, while the poorer people can get hounded for errors of a few pounds on their tax returns or benefits claims. Many years back, I got overpaid 100 of housing benefit due to how college grants were handled - not even my fault; I had THREE suits on my doorstep threatening me with prison; yet nothing is being done to government ministers who sold fake PPE to the NHS for hundreds of millions of pounds.","112"

"Other than time there isn't one, as far as I'm concerned. Some men join and they stick with their localBlue lodge. Others go all in and join the the different bodies. Neither choice is eight over the other. I know some who have been Masons for over 30 years and never joined any of the other groups. They still get a lot out of being a Mason. Personally, I did see spending my time with the other groups as a disadvantage. Iron sharpens iron after all. Spending time around brothers who want to help each other is never a bad thing.","114"
"Eosinophilia is often due to an allergic reaction. The immune system is trying to protect the body by increasing the eosinophil count. The eosinophils in turn release histamine. This is why patients are fatigue and often form rashes or hives. A high eosinophil count is also seen in a parasitic infection. Their granules contain MBP, which disrupts the lipid bilayer of parasites. Eosinophils also contain ECP, which is bactericidal and toxic to helminths, a common parasitic worm found in the intestines. Eosinophilia can also be caused by a reaction to some specific drugs and it is seen in some types of leukemia.","113"

"In the first place Army don't have this practice of talking which religion they are. They celebrate every festival. You see Muslims with Tilak on their forehead on Diwali and you see Hindus doing namaz on ramzan. Modi is going to a place to celebrate where they don't talk about religion or caste or anything else except unity. He's looking at spending a day with them representing whole country in support of them on a festival. He's assuring their families safety inside the country when they are ensuring the whole country's safety along the border. It's the way we understand it right.","115"
"I believe beards are often associated with conservatism, and shaved beards reflect reform and progress. For example, it is rare that you find any Western leaders with beards. Take the last few American presidents as an example: Although, the beard is slowly starting to make its way back into Western popular culture as a feature of handsomeness not manliness- this is too politically incorrect for today's age. Chris Hemsworth, Australian actor often praised for his appearance. Furthermore, some Western countries simply host populations whose genes do not possess beard growing traits. Thus it is hard for people in these countries to grow beards.","116"
"I am an atheist but I have read the Bible. Nothing in it says anything about banning abortion. Genesis states that a man became a living soul when he breathed his first breath. There is a recipe for inducing abortion that priests were to give women suspected of infidelity. There is a passage about how much money a person should pay the husband not the woman if that person damages a fetus. God ordered the destruction of entire populations, including having babies bashed against rocks, and fetuses torn from womens wombs. So, no, anti-abortion laws are not godly.","109"

"The difference lies in the ideology of the two countries. UK journalism is critical, thorough and much more factual because the sector is regulated. The United States from the onset was meant to be a land of the free and a place of opportunities. Thus, journalism in America covers a broader scope, is more innovative and often driven by emotions and sentiments. Thus, the answer to your question depends on what superior means. If superior is about accuracy, depth and stringencies, British journalism wins. If it is about scope, innovation and inciting the audiences sentiments, then American journalism is far superior.","116"
"Well, It depends on one's preference of taste like sweet, sour, spicy etc and the availability of items in that particular Indian restaurant like if the restaurant is serving South IndianNorth Indian dishes etc. Every Restaurant has its own bestpopular serving dish. Please check which dish is being best served in that restaurant. For example, if that restaurant is best at serving samosadosarotigravy etc, try those dishes first. Always try the basic dish first.

"The shrewdest, smartest maneuver I have ever seen in business was when Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

Additionally, the acquisition allowed Amazon to gain a foothold in the grocery industry, which is a huge market. This acquisition was a brilliant move for Amazon as it allowed them to quickly expand their presence in the grocery industry and gain a competitive edge in the market.","109"
"If its your dog making you sick, then you should be getting sick more often than every few weeks, right? I am assuming you live with your dog and therefore see and touch him every day. So if your dog was making you sick, you would never get better no breaks in between illnesses unless you got rid of your dog. However, this is not the case.

"A forest fire spreads rapidly due to abundance of wood, which serves as a good fuel for the fire. Also controlling forest fires becomes difficult as the area is large and application of water and other fire preventive materials like fire extinguishers becomes difficult. Hence it is difficult to control forest fires. What is the main cause of wildfires? Nearly 85 percent of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans. Human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, equipment use and malfunctions, negligently discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson.
