in 1980 jimbo and miwa evaluated the diagonal twopoint correlation function of the square lattice ising model as a taufunction of the sixth painleve system by constructing an associated isomonodromic system within their theory of holonomic quantum fields more recently an alternative isomonodromy theory was constructed based on biorthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with regular semiclassical weights for which the diagonal ising correlations arise as the leading coefficient of the polynomials specialised appropriately here we demonstrate that the nexttodiagonal correlations of the anisotropic ising model are evaluated as one of the elements of this isomonodromic system or essentially as the cauchyhilbert transform of one of the biorthogonal polynomials,0

we characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power frobeniusperron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite pgroups we also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category c admits an analogue of the sylow decomposition if the simple objects of c have integral frobeniusperron dimensions then c is grouptheoretical as a consequence we obtain that semisimple quasihopf algebras of prime power dimension are grouptheoretical our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from lagrangian subcategories of modular categories this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasilie bialgebras in terms of manin pairs,0

the gravitational field equations on cosmological scales are obtained by averaging the einstein field equations of general relativity by assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales the local inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction backreaction terms which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the friedmannlemaitrerobertsonwalker models the effects of averaging on cosmological observations are discussed it is argued that based on estimates from observational data the backreaction and in particular the averaged spatial curvature can have a very significant dynamical effect on the evolution of the universe and must be taken into account in observational cosmology,0
in this paper we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces let m be the matrix of the amplitudes of ketpsi we prove m is a compact operator we also prove ketpsi is separable if and only if m is a bounded linear operator with rank 1 that is the image of m is a one dimensional hilbert space so we have related the separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces to an important class of bounded linear operators in functional analysis which has many interesting properties,0

we consider an initial evepopulation and a population of neutral mutants such that the total population dies out in finite time we describe the evolution of the evepopulation and the total population with continuous state branching processes and the neutral mutation procedure can be seen as an immigration process with intensity proportional to the size of the population first we establish a williams decomposition of the genealogy of the total population given by a continuous random tree according to the ancestral lineage of the last individual alive this allows us give a closed formula for the probability of simultaneous extinction of the evepopulation and the total population,0
quantum relativity as a generalized or rather deformed version of einstein relativity with a linear realization on a classical sixgeometry beyond the familiar setting of spacetime offer a new framework to think about the quantum spacetime structure the formulation requires two deformations to be implemented through imposing two fundamental invariants we take them to be the independent planck mass and planck length together they gives the quantum hbar the scheme leads to small boldmathprotect so24 as the relativity symmetry the quantum world has an ads_5 classical geometry which is parallel to the conformal universe but not scale invariant,0
quantum corrections to transport through a chaotic ballistic cavity are known to be universal the universality not only applies to the magnitude of quantum corrections but also to their dependence on external parameters such as the fermi energy or an applied magnetic field here we consider such parameter dependence of quantum transport in a ballistic chaotic cavity in the semiclassical limit obtained by sending plancks constant to zero without changing the classical dynamics of the open cavity in this limit quantum corrections are shown to have a universal parametric dependence which is not described by random matrix theory,0
in this work we consider several types of lubricants  including nonnewtonian fluids  that were studied under various operating conditions leading us to explore a wide range of dimensionless parameters the experimental results are compared with predictions given by the usual analytical ehl relationships and by more recently developed models this broad comparison conducted with particular emphasis on minimum film thickness hm showed a fair agreement between experimental data and a few predictions including some obtained from extended models commonly used elastohydrodynamic lubrication ehl models did not systematically gave accurate hm estimation whereas minimum film thickness not only is a yield value but also serves as a key parameter in estimating lubrication regimes,0

dysons integration theorem is widely used in the computation of eigenvalue correlation functions in random matrix theory here we focus on the variant of the theorem for determinants relevant for the unitary ensembles with dyson index beta  2 we derive a formula reducing the nkfold integral of an n x n determinant of a kernel of two sets of arbitrary functions to a determinant of size k x k our generalisation allows for sets of functions that are not orthogonal or biorthogonal with respect to the integration measure in the special case of orthogonal functions dysons theorem is recovered,0
by using only combinatorial data on two posets x and y we construct a set of socalled formulas a formula produces simultaneously for any abelian category a a functor between the categories of complexes of diagrams over x and y with values in a this functor induces a triangulated functor between the corresponding derived categories this allows us to prove for pairs x y of posets sharing certain common underlying combinatorial structure that for any abelian category a regardless of its nature the categories of diagrams over x and y with values in a are derived equivalent,0
parametric instabilities driven by partially coherent radiation in plasmas are described by a generalized statistical wignermoyal set of equations formally equivalent to the full wave equation coupled to the plasma fluid equations a generalized dispersion relation for stimulated raman scattering driven by a partially coherent pump field is derived revealing a growth rate dependence with the coherence width sigma of the radiation field scaling with 1sigma for backscattering threewave process and with 1sigma12 for direct forward scattering fourwave process our results demonstrate the possibility to control the growth rates of these instabilities by properly using broadband pump radiation fields,0
we apply results of malliavinthalmaierwatanabe for strong and weak taylor expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations sdes in particular we work out weight expressions for the taylor coefficients of the expansion the results are applied to libor market models in order to deal with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility in contrast to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full sde we obtain easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing in particular we present an easily tractable alternative to freezing the drift in libor market models which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme numerical examples underline the results,0
we investigate the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a circular waveguide with conducting walls filled by homogeneous dielectric the parts corresponding to the radiation field are separated and the formulae for the radiation intensity are derived for both te and tm waves it is shown that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the te waves various limiting cases are considered the results of the numerical calculations show that the insertion of the waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium,0
we introduce a special class of pairwiseindependent selfjoinings for a stationary process those for which one coordinate is a continuous function of the two others we investigate which properties on the process the existence of such a joining entails in particular we prove that if the process is aperiodic then it has positive entropy our other results suggest that such pairwise independent nonindependent selfjoinings exist only in very specific situations essentially when the process is a subshift of finite type topologically conjugate to a fullshift this provides an argument in favor of the conjecture that 2fold mixing implies 3foldmixing,0

we present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts addressing the neck of the contact we compare characteristic geometries to investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic states we find that the al 3pz states are very sensitive against modifications of the orbital overlap which has serious consequences for the transport properties stretching of the contact shifts states towards the fermi energy leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering by spacial restriction hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge neutrality is violated we discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means of quantitative results for the charge transfer,0
at the airwater interface 48alkyl11biphenyl4carbonitrile 8cb domains with different thicknesses coexist in the same langmuir film as multiple bilayers on a monolayer the edge dislocation at the domain boundary leads to line tension which determines the domain shape and dynamics by observing the domain relaxation process starting from small distortions we find that the line tension is linearly dependent on the thickness difference between the coexisting phases in the film comparisons with theoretical treatments in the literature suggest that the edge dislocation at the boundary locates near the center of the film which means that the 8cb multilayers are almost symmetric with respect to the airwater interface,0
the expansion rate of intermediate inflation lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution present study of intermediate inflation reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution leading to late time acceleration the corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some noncanonical form of kinetic term thus the so called intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic desitter expansion,0
we study the casimir force in pistonlike geometries semiclassically the force on the piston is finite and physical but to leading semiclassical approximation depends strongly on the shape of the surrounding cavity whereas this force is attractive for pistons in a parallelepiped with flat cylinder head for which the semiclassical approximation by periodic orbits is exact this approximation to the force on the piston vanishes for a semicylindrical head and becomes repulsive for a cylinder of circular cross section with a hemispherical head in leading semiclassical approximation the sign of the force is related to the generalized maslov index of short periodic orbits between the piston and its casing,0
the description of resources in game semantics has never achieved the simplicity and precision of linear logic because of a misleading conception the belief that linear logic is more primitive than game semantics we advocate instead the contrary that game semantics is conceptually more primitive than linear logic starting from this revised point of view we design a categorical model of resources in game semantics and construct an arena game model where the usual notion of bracketing is extended to multi bracketing in order to capture various resource policies linear af64257ne and exponential,0
we investigate graphene and graphene layers on different substrates by monochromatic and whitelight confocal rayleigh scattering microscopy the image contrast depends sensitively on the dielectric properties of the sample as well as the substrate geometry and can be described quantitatively using the complex refractive index of bulk graphite for few layers 6 the monochromatic contrast increases linearly with thickness the samples behave as a superposition of single sheets which act as independent two dimensional electron gases thus rayleigh imaging is a general simple and quick tool to identify graphene layers that is readily combined with raman scattering which provides structural identification,0
we have developed an image restoration technique based on the richardsonlucy algorithm optimized for glastlat image analysis our algorithm is original since it utilizes the psf point spread function that is calculated for each event this is critical for egret and glastlat image analysis since the psf depends on the energy and angle of incident gammarays and varies by more than one order of magnitude egret and glastlat image analysis also faces poisson noise due to low photon statistics our technique incorporates wavelet filtering to minimize noise effects we present studies of egret sources using this novel image restoration technique for possible identification of extended gammaray sources,0
we show that holographic models of qcd predict the presence of a chernsimons coupling between vector and axialvector mesons at finite baryon density in the adscft dictionary the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the baryon number density and is fixed uniquely in the fivedimensional holographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents for the lightest mesons the coupling mixes transverse rho and a_1 polarization states at sufficiently large baryon number densities it produces an instability which causes the rho and a_1 mesons to condense in a state breaking both rotational and translational invariance,0
we construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with and without surface melting we use the model to investigate the results of recent molecular dynamics simulations which suggest the melting temperature of a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle with the same surface curvature our model shows that this is only the case when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are similar this is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting begins,0
continuous variable entanglement is a manifestation of nonclassicality of quantum states in this paper we attempt to analyze whether and under which conditions nonclassicality can be used as an entanglement criterion we adopt the wellaccepted definition of nonclassicality in the form of lack of welldefined positive glauber sudarshan pfunction describing the state after demonstrating that the classicality of subsystems is not sufficient for the nonclassicality of the overall state to be identifiable with entanglement we focus on gaussian states and find specific local unitary transformations required to arrive at this equivalency this is followed by the analysis of quantitative relation between nonclassicality and entanglement,0
from an n1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the gauge group sun_c x sun_c with fundamentals for each gauge group the bifundamentals and a symmetric flavor and a conjugate symmetric flavor for sun_c we apply seiberg dual to each gauge group independently and obtain two n1 supersymmetric dual magnetic gauge theories with dual matters including the gauge singlets by analyzing the fterm equations of the dual magnetic superpotentials we describe the intersecting brane configurations of type iia string theory corresponding to the metastable nonsupersymmetric vacua of these gauge theories the case where the above symmetric flavor is replaced by an antisymmetric flavor is also discussed,0
we present a solid state implementation of quantum computation which improves previously proposed optically driven schemes our proposal is based on vertical arrays of quantum dots embedded in a mesoporous material which can be fabricated with present technology the redundant encoding typical of the chosen hardware protects the computation against gate errors and the effects of measurement induced noise the system parameters required for quantum computation applications are calculated for iivi and iiiv materials and found to be within the experimental range the proposed hardware may help minimize errors due to polydispersity of dot sizes which is at present one of the main problems in relation to quantum dotbased quantum computation,0
cendomorphisms arising from superselection structures with nontrivial centre define a rank and a first chern class crossed products by such endomorphisms involve the cuntzpimsner algebra of a vector bundle having the abovementioned rank and first chern class and can be used to construct a duality for abstract nonsymmetric tensor categories vs group bundles acting on nonsymmetric hilbert bimodules existence and unicity of the dual object ie the gauge group bundle are not ensured we give a description of this phenomenon in terms of a certain moduli space associated with the given endomorphism the abovementioned hilbert bimodules are noncommutative analogues of gaugeequivariant vector bundles in the sense of nistortroitsky,0

among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course we have the pivotal idea championed by dirac that functions correspond to column vectors kets and that differential operators correspond to matrices ketbras acting on those vectors the matlab matrixlaboratory programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems in this article we share matlab codes which have been developed at wpi focusing on 1d problems to be used in conjunction with griffiths introductory text,0
in the first part of this paper we present a set of simple arguments to show that the twodimensional gauge anomaly and the 21dimensional lorentz symmetry determine the leading gaussian term in the vacuum wave function of 21dimensional yangmills theory this is to highlight the robustness of the wave function and its relative insensitivity to the choice of regularizations we then comment on the correspondence with the explicit calculations done in earlier papers we also make some comments on the nature of the gaugeinvariant configuration space for euclidean threedimensional gauge fields relevant to 31dimensional yangmills theory,0
the system created in noncentral relativistic nucleusnucleus collisions possesses large orbital angular momentum due to spinorbit coupling particles produced in such a system could become globally polarized along the direction of the system angular momentum we present the results of lambda and antilambda hyperon global polarization measurements in auau collisions at sqrts_nn624 gev and 200 gev performed with the star detector at rhic the observed global polarization of lambda and antilambda hyperons in the star acceptance is consistent with zero within the precision of the measurements the obtained upper limit p_lambdaantilambda  002 is compared to the theoretical values discussed recently in the literature,0
it is well established that mass loss from agb stars due to dust driven winds cannot be arbitrarily low we model the mass loss from carbon rich agb stars using detailed frequencydependent radiation hydrodynamics including dust formation we present a study of the thresholds for the mass loss rate as a function of stellar parameters based on a subset of a larger grid of such models and compare these results to previous observational and theoretical work furthermore we demonstrate the impact of the pulsation mechanism and dust formation for the creation of a stellar wind and how it affects these thresholds and briefly discuss the consequences for stellar evolution,0
classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding finite time difference equation the equation is then symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to d where d is the smallest span of time this symmetric equation has solutions which come in reciprocally related pairs one member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0 this solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of halfintegers,0
we study the thermodynamics of the hard wall model which consists in the introduction of an infrared cutoff in asymptotically ads spaces this is a toy model for confining backgrounds in the context of the gaugegravity correspondence we use holographic renormalization and reproduce the existence of a hawking page phase transition recently discussed by herzog we also show that the entropy jumps from n0 to n2 which reinforces the interpretation of this transition as the gravity dual of confinementdeconfinement we also show that similar results hold for the phenomenologically motivated soft wall model underlining the potential universality of our analysis,0
the aim of this work is to perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a laser in a plasma at each time step one has to solve a helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells to solve this huge linear system one uses a iterative krylov method with a preconditioning by a separable matrix the corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method some enlightments on the parallel implementation are also given lastly numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture,0
we consider quantum field theory in fourdimensional minkowski spacetime with the position coordinates represented by twistors instead of the usual worldvectors upon imposing canonical commutation relations between twistors and dual twistors quantum theory of fields described by nonholomorphic functions of twistor variables becomes manifestly noncommutative with lorentz symmetry broken by a timelike vector we discuss the free field propagation and its impact on the short and longdistance behavior of physical amplitudes in perturbation theory in the ultraviolet limit quantum field theories in twistor space are generically less divergent than their commutative counterparts furthermore there is no infraredultraviolet mixing problem,0
we study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds by considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding universe possibly filled with radiation we focus on the dissipative effects related to the expansion rate at first order we recover the expected result that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature beyond linear order the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion parameter this latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the vacuum finally we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and briefly discuss applications to the transplanckian question,0
we study experimentally the collective motion of grains inside a u shaped tube undergoing vertical oscillations and we develop a very simple quantitative model that captures relevant features of the observed behaviour the height difference between the granular columns grows with time when the system is shaken at sufficiently low frequencies the system exhibits two types of growth exponentially divergent type i and exponentially saturating type ii depending on the size of the grains the type i growth can be quenched by removing the air whereas the type ii behavior can occur in the absence of air there is a good agreement between the model proposed and our experimental results,0
quantum transport properties in quantum hall wires in the presence of spatially correlated random potential are investigated numerically it is found that the potential correlation reduces the localization length associated with the edge state in contrast to the naive expectation that the potential correlation increases it the effect appears as the sizable shift of quantized conductance plateaus in long wires where the plateau transitions occur at energies much higher than the landau band centers the scale of the shift is of the order of the strength of the random potential and is insensitive to the strength of magnetic fields experimental implications are also discussed,0
in this paper we consider the following form of the socalled mean field equation arising from the statistical mechanics description of two dimensional turbulence beginequationlabeleqstudy  d_g u  rho_1 fraceuint_sig eu dv_g1rho_2 fraceuint_sig eu dv_g  1 endequation on a given closed orientable riemannian surface sigma g with volume 1 where rho_1 rho_2 are real parameters exploiting the variational structure of the problem and running a minmax scheme introduced by djadli and malchiodi we prove that if k is a positive integer rho_1 and rho_2 two real numbers such that rho_1in 8kpi 8k1pi and rho_24pi then eqrefeqstudy is solvable,0
the identification of the limiting factors in the dynamical behavior of complex systems is an important interdisciplinary problem which often can be traced to the spectral properties of an underlying network by deriving a general relation between the eigenvalues of weighted and unweighted networks here i show that for a wide class of networks the dynamical behavior is tightly bounded by few network parameters this result provides rigorous conditions for the design of networks with predefined dynamical properties and for the structural control of physical processes in complex systems the results are illustrated using synchronization phenomena as a model process,0
we present the results of detailed spectroscopic abundance analyses for 18 elements in 31 nearby stars with planets the resulting abundances are combined with other similar studies of nearby stars with planets and compared to a sample of nearby stars without detected planets we find some evidence for abundance differences between these two samples for al si and ti some of our results are in conflict with a recent study of stars with planets in the spocs database we encourage continued study of the abundance patterns of stars with planets to resolve these discrepancies,0
lasers and leds display a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted in a given time interval new applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons or pairs are generated in a regulated stream here we review recent research on singlephoton sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot in just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable singlephotons and entangled photon pairs using such structures it suggests it may be possible to realise compact robust ledlike semiconductor devices for quantum light generation,0
timeofflight tof cameras are based on a new technology that delivers distance maps by the use of a modulated light source in this paper we first describe a set of experiments that we performed with tof cameras we then propose a noise model which is able to explain some of the phenomena observed in the experiments the model is based on assuming a noise source that is correlated with the light source shot noise and an additional additive noise source dark current noise the model predicts well the dependency of the distance errors on the image intensity and the true distance at an individual pixel,0
we conjecture that because of color confinement the physical vacuum forms an event horizon for quarks and gluons which can be crossed only by quantum tunneling ie through the qcd counterpart of hawking radiation by black holes since such radiation cannot transmit information to the outside it must be thermal of a temperature determined by the chromodynamic force at the confinement surface and it must maintain color neutrality we explore the possibility that the resulting process provides a common mechanism for thermal hadron production in high energy interactions from ee annihilation to heavy ion collisions,0
a comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for the paircreation contact process is presented in contrast to the ordinary contact process whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the paircreation process to circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which onesite creation is added to the paircreation an alternative method is the generation of subcritical series expansions which works even for the case of the pure paircreation process differently from the supercritical case the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations,0
we study the computation of the static quark potential under decimations in the monte carlo renormalization group mcrg employing a multirepresentation plaquette action we find that finetuning the decimation prescription so that the mcrg equilibrium selfconsistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances in particular lattice coarsening change of effective lattice spacing on actiongenerated lattices after decimation is nearly eliminated failure to correctly tune the decimation on the other hand produces large coarsening effects of order 50 or more consistent with those seen in previous studies we also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances where no particular improvement is seen for this action,0
we consider the transport through a system of three coupled quantum dots in a perpendicular magnetic field at zero field destructive interference can trap an electron in a dark state  a coherent superposition of dot states that completely blocks current flow the magnetic field can disrupt this interference giving rise to oscillations in the current and its higherorder statistics as the field is increased these oscillations have a period of either the fluxquantum or half the fluxquantum depending on the dot geometry we give results for the stationary current and for the shotnoise and skewness at zero and finite frequency,0
the navierstokes equations and magnetohydrodynamics equations are written in terms of poloidal and toroidal potentials in a finite cylinder this formulation insures that the velocity and magnetic fields are divergencefree by construction but leads to systems of partial differential equations of higher order whose boundary conditions are coupled the influence matrix technique is used to transform these systems into decoupled parabolic and elliptic problems the magnetic field in the induction equation is matched to that in an exterior vacuum by means of the dirichlettoneumann mapping thus eliminating the need to discretize the exterior the influence matrix is scaled in order to attain an acceptable condition number,0
we performed a visualization of membrane proteins labeled with 10nm gold nanoparticles in cells using an alloptical method based on photothermal interference contrast the high sensitivity of the method and the stability of the signals allows 3d imaging of individual nanoparticles without the drawbacks of photobleaching and blinking inherent to fluorescent markers a simple analytical model is derived to account for the measurements of the signal amplitude and the spatial resolution the photothermal interference contrast method provides an efficient reproducible and promising way to visualize low amounts of proteins in cells by optical means,0
we describe how to compute planar gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling in n4 super yang mills by using the gaugestring duality the computation boils down to finding a certain classical string configuration whose boundary conditions are determined by the gluon momenta the results are infrared divergent we introduce the gravity version of dimensional regularization to define finite quantities the leading and subleading ir divergencies are characterized by two functions of the coupling that we compute at strong coupling we compute also the full finite form for the four point amplitude and we find agreement with a recent ansatz by bern dixon and smirnov,0
we present a systematic semiclassical procedure to compute the partition function for scalar field theories at finite temperature the central objects in our scheme are the solutions of the classical equations of motion in imaginary time with spatially independent boundary conditions field fluctuations  both field deviations around these classical solutions and fluctuations of the boundary value of the fields  are resummed in a gaussian approximation in our final expression for the partition function this resummation is reduced to solving certain ordinary differential equations moreover we show that it is renormalizable with the usual 1loop counterterms,0
we show that coupled two level systems like qubits studied in quantum information can be used as a thermodynamic machine at least three qubits or spins are necessary and arranged in a chain the system is interfaced between two split baths and the working spin in the middle is externally driven the machine performs carnottype cycles and is able to work as heat pump or engine depending on the temperature difference of the baths delta t and the energy differences in the spin system delta e it can be shown that the efficiency is a function of delta t and delta e,0
some of the theoretical challenges posed by the general relativistic description of binary systems of compact objects neutron stars or black holes are reviewed we recall the various ways one can use the theory of the motion and of the timing of binary pulsars to test the strongfield andor radiative aspects of general relativity recent advances in the theory of the motion and radiation of binary black holes are discussed one emphasizes the usefulness of the effective one body approach in providing a quasianalytical description of the waveform emitted by coalescing binary black holes,0
an iterative method for recovering the bulk information in asymptotically ads spacetimes is presented we consider zero energy spacelike geodesics and their relation to the entanglement entropy in three dimensions to determine the metric in certain symmetric cases a number of comparisons are made with an alternative extraction method presented in arxivhepth0609202 and the two methods are then combined to allow metric recovery in the most general type of static spherically symmetric setups we conclude by extracting the mass and density profiles for a toy model example of a gas of radiation in 21dimensional ads,0
we use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic accretion in fractal media the fractional continuous medium model allows the generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum density these make it possible to consider the general case of spherical hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium the general nature of the solution is similar to the bondi solution but the accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium the theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation results for the particular case of accretion onto premainsequence stars,0
the laws of thermodynamics provide a clear concept of the temperature for an equilibrium system in the continuum limit meanwhile the equipartition theorem allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic energy and the uniform temperature when a system or its environment is far from equilibrium however such an association does not necessarily apply in small systems the regression hypothesis may not even apply herein we show that in small nonequilibrium systems the regression hypothesis still holds though with a generalized definition of the temperature the latter must now be defined for each such manifestation,0
we investigate the jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a dynamically responsive dark halo it is shown that the diskhalo system becomes nominally jeans unstable on small scales the instability is suppressed if the toomre stability index q_t is higher than a certain threshold but on large scales the jeans instability sets invariably in however using a simple selfconsistent diskhalo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal effect from a practical point of view the jeans instability of galactic disks is not affected by a live dark halo,0

the idea that substantial absorption in agn could be a definite characteristic of the early phases of qso evolution was invoked to explain the submillimeter observations of xray absorbed agn at z1 to z3 that have shown strong emission at 850 mkm this strong emission is a signature of the copious star formation in agn evolution model the main obscured growth phase of the qso coincides with formation of the host galaxy spheroid the completion of which indicates the beginning of the luminous unobscured phase of the qsos evolution the verification of this model at redshifts up to z6 appears possible via application of the gammaray resonant absorption method,0
in a recent letter bergsten and coauthors have studied the resistance oscillations with gate voltage and magnetic field in arrays of semiconductor rings and interpreted the oscillatory magnetic field dependence as altshuleraronovspivak aas oscillations and oscillatory dependence on gate voltage as the aharonovcasher ac effect this comment shows that bergsten and coauthors incorrectly identified aas effect as a source of resistance oscillations in magnetic field that spin relaxation in their experimental setting is strong enough to destroy oscillatory effects of spin origin and that the oscillations are caused by changes in carrier density and the fermi energy by gate and are unrelated to spin,0

we compare the roles of fidelity and entanglement in characterizing renormalization group flows and quantum phase transitions it turns out that the scaling parameter extracted from fidelity for different ground states succeeds to capture nontrivial information including stable and unstable fixed points whereas the von neumann entropy as a bipartite entanglement measure or equivalently majorization relations satisfied by the spectra of the reduced density matrix along renormalization group flows often fails as far as the intrinsic irreversibilityinformation loss along renormalization group flowsis concerned we also clarify an intimate connection between the von neumman entropy majorization relations and fidelity the relevance to zamolodchikovs c theorem is indicated,0
we show that the centrality and systemsize dependence of elliptic flow measured at rhic are fully described by a simple model based on eccentricity scaling and incomplete thermalization we argue that the elliptic flow is at least 25 below the ideal hydrodynamic limit even for the most central auau collisions this lack of perfect equilibration allows for estimates of the effective parton cross section in the quarkgluon plasma and of its viscosity to entropy density ratio we also show how the initial conditions affect the transport coefficients and thermodynamic quantities extracted from the data in particular the viscosity and the speed of sound,0
suppose that a target function is monotonic namely weakly increasing and an original estimate of the target function is available which is not weakly increasing many common estimation methods used in statistics produce such estimates we show that these estimates can always be improved with no harm using rearrangement techniques the rearrangement methods univariate and multivariate transform the original estimate to a monotonic estimate and the resulting estimate is closer to the true curve in common metrics than the original estimate we illustrate the results with a computational example and an empirical example dealing with ageheight growth charts,0
we study the appearance of anomalies of the master ward identity which is a universal renormalization condition in perturbative qft the main insight of the present paper is that any violation of the master ward identity can be expressed as a local interacting field this is a version of the wellknown quantum action principle of lowenstein and lam proceeding in a proper field formalism by induction on the order in hbar this knowledge about the structure of possible anomalies as well as techniques of algebraic renormalization are used to remove possible anomalies by finite renormalizations as an example the method is applied to prove the ward identities of the on scalar field model,0

pjcameron introduced the orbit algebra of a permutation group and conjectured that this algebra is an integral domain if and only if the group has no finite orbit we prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the age algebra of a relational structure r is an integral domain if and only if r is ageinexhaustible we deduce these results from a combinatorial lemma asserting that if a product of two nonzero elements of a set algebra is zero then there is a finite common tranversal of their supports the proof is built on ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle algebra,0
a method based on bayesian neural networks and genetic algorithm is proposed to control the fermentation process the relationship between input and output variables is modelled using bayesian neural network that is trained using hybrid monte carlo method a feedback loop based on genetic algorithm is used to change input variables so that the output variables are as close to the desired target as possible without the loss of confidence level on the prediction that the neural network gives the proposed procedure is found to reduce the distance between the desired target and measured outputs significantly,0
we show that rmode instabilities severely constraint the composition of a compact star rotating at a submillisecond period in particular the only viable astrophysical scenario for such an object present inside the low mass xray binary associated with the xray transient xte j1739285 is that it has a strangeness content since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates the only remaining possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid quarkhadron star we also discuss under which conditions submillisecond pulsars are rare,0

the leftright twin higgslrth model predicts the existence of the charged higgs phipm in this paper we study the production of the charged higgs boson phi with single top quark via the process bgto tphi at the cern large hadron colliderlhc the numerical results show that the production cross section can reach the level of 10 pb in the reasonable parameter space of the lrth model we expect that as long as it is not too heavy the possible signatures of the heavy charged higgs boson phi might be detected via the decay mode phito bartb at the lhc experiments,0
the six higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the standard model that addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification another higgs doublet in a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group such as s_6 is added to the sm the lightest components of the 5higgs are neutral stable and serve as dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken direct and indirect detection signals as well as collider signatures are discussed the fivefold multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments,0
insulating la195sr005cuo4 shares with superconducting cuprates the same fincherburkelike spin excitations which usually are observed in itinerant antiferromagnets the local spectral function satisfies omegat scaling above 16 k for this incommensurate insulating cuprate together with previous results in commensurate insulating and incommensurate superconducting cuprates these results further support the general scaling prediction for squarelattice quantum spin s12 systems the width of incommensurate peaks in la195sr005cuo4 scales to a similar finite value as at optimal doping strongly suggesting that they are similarly distant from a quantum critical point they might both be limited to a finite correlation length by the partial spinglass freezing,0
we discuss in this paper two ways of defining the concept of effective field theory effective field theory defined by low energy effectiveness and effective field theory defined by 4d effectiveness out of higher dimensions we argue that these two views are actually equivalent that effective field theories at low energy can in fact be regarded as field theories of higher dimensions confined on a 4d spcaetime we examine this idea through comparing two different regularization schemes momentum cutoff and dimensional regularization and through analyzing how fields can be localized on branes,0
we study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially created scalefree networks and the real network structure of the power grid the capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of the load or the betweenness centrality through the use of a simple functional form with two free parameters revealed is that it is indeed possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost we suggest that our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly important for the design of more robust realworld networks to cascading failures,0
the nonclassical rotational inertia fraction of the identical cylindrical solid 4he below 300 mk is studied at 496 and 1173 hz by a double resonance torsional oscillator below 35 mk the fraction is the same at sufficiently low rim velocities above 35 mk the fraction is greater for the higher than the lower mode the dissipation peak of the lower mode occurs at a temperature sim 4 mk lower than that of the higher mode the drive dependence of the two modes shows that the reduction of the fraction is characterized by critical velocity textitnot amplitude nor acceleration,0

we consider discrete nonlinear hyperbolic equations on quadgraphs in particular on the square lattice the fields are associated to the vertices and an equation qx_1x_2x_3x_40 relates four fields at one quad integrability of equations is understood as 3dconsistency the latter is a possibility to consistently impose equations of the same type on all the faces of a threedimensional cube this allows to set these equations also on multidimensional lattices zn we classify integrable equations with complex fields x and q affinelinear with respect to all arguments the method is based on analysis of singular solutions,0
when fischler and susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the particle horizon they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the particle horizon area in this article after a short review of their original work we expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough it has been also shown that the holographic principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated universe the fischlersusskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum number of degrees of freedom per planck volume at the planck era compatible with the holographic principle,0
constraint languages that arise from finite algebras have recently been the object of study especially in connection with the dichotomy conjecture of feder and vardi an important class of algebras are those that generate congruence distributive varieties and included among this class are lattices and more generally those algebras that have nearunanimity term operations an algebra will generate a congruence distributive variety if and only if it has a sequence of ternary term operations called jonsson terms that satisfy certain equations we prove that constraint languages consisting of relations that are invariant under a short sequence of jonsson terms are tractable by showing that such languages have bounded relational width,0
we present a new design of dielectric microcavities supporting modes with large quality factors and highly directional light emission the key idea is to place a point scatterer inside a dielectric circular microdisk we show that depending on the position and strength of the scatterer this leads to strongly directional modes in various frequency regions while preserving the high qfactors reminiscent of the whispering gallery modes of the microdisk without scatterer the design is very appealing due to its simplicity promising a cleaner experimental realisation than previously studied microcavity designs on the one hand and analytic tractability based on greens function techniques and selfadjoint extension theory on the other,0
the anticommuting properties of fermionic operators together with the presence of parity conservation affect the concept of entanglement in a composite fermionic system hence different points of view can give rise to different reasonable definitions of separable and entangled states here we analyze these possibilities and the relationship between the different classes of separable states we illustrate the differences by providing a complete characterization of all the sets defined for systems of two fermionic modes the results are applied to gibbs states of infinite chains of fermions whose interaction corresponds to a xyhamiltonian with transverse magnetic field,0

in this paper we build on the framework developed in subelliptic boundary value problems for the spin_c dirac operator i ii iii to obtain a more complete understanding of the gluing properties for indices of boundary value problems for the spincdirac operator with subelliptic boundary conditions we extend our analytic results for subelliptic boundary value problems for the spincdirac operator and gluing results for the indices of these boundary problems to spincmanifolds with several pseudoconvex pseudoconcave boundary components these results are applied to study stein fillability for compact 3dimensional contact manifolds,0
in order to compute the packing dimension of orthogonal projections falconer and howroyd 1997 introduced a family of packing dimension profiles rm dim_s that are parametrized by real numbers s0 subsequently howroyd 2001 introduced alternate sdimensional packing dimension profiles hboxrm pdim_s and proved among many other things that hboxrm pdim_s erm dim_s e for all integers s0 and all analytic sets esubseteqrn the goal of this article is to prove that hboxrm pdim_s erm dim_s e for all real numbers s0 and analytic sets esubseteqrn this answers a question of howroyd 2001 p 159 our proof hinges on a new property of fractional brownian motion,0
in analogy with the load and the metage in hydrodynamics we define magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of magnetofluids they can be used to write the magnetic field in mhd in clebschs form we show how these two concepts can be utilised to derive the magnetic analogue of the ertels theorem and also how in the presence of nontrivial topology of the magnetic field in the magnetofluid one may associate the linking number of the magnetic field lines with the invariant mhd loads the paper illustrates that the symmetry translation of the mhd metage in the corresponding label space generates the conservation of cross helicity,0
magnetic domain patterns under an oscillating field is studied theoretically by using a simple isinglike model we propose two ways to investigate the effects of the oscillating field the first one leads to a model in which rapidly oscillating terms are averaged out and the model can explain the existence of the maximum amplitude of the field for the appearance of patterns the second one leads to a model that includes the delay of the response to the field and the model suggests the existence of a traveling pattern which moves very slowly compared with the time scale of the driving field,0
we consider reactiondiffusion equations with combustiontype nonlinearities in two dimensions and study speedup of their pulsating fronts by general periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure we show that the occurence of front speedup in the sense lim_atoinfty c_ainfty with a the amplitude of the flow and c_a the minimal front speed only depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function in particular front speedup happens for kpp reactions if and only if it does for ignition reactions we also show that the flows which achieve this speedup are precisely those which when scaled properly are able to quench any ignition reaction,0
this paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of highlycommitted wellconnected opinion leaders endowed with a strong convincing power each individual located at a vertex of a directed graph is characterized by her name the list of people she is interacting with her level of awareness and her opinion various temporal evolutions according to different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the formation of strongly polarized subgroups each adopting the opinion of one of the two groups of opinion leaders is favored,0
an explanation of the recently discovered 7 s pulsations from the isolated neutron star rx j185653754 is presented it is assumed that the real spin period of this source is approx1 s whereas the observed spinmodulation is caused by the presence of a nearly transverse very low frequency drift waves in the pulsar magnetosphere it is supposed that the period of the drift wave is equal to a recently observed one the simulated lightcurve is plotted the angular parameters are defined and the value of the pulsed fraction of only sim 12 is explained,0
let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2 and let w be the ring of infinite witt vectors over k suppose d is a dihedral 2group we prove that the universal deformation ring rdv of an endotrivial kdmodule v is always isomorphic to wmathbbz2timesmathbbz2 as a consequence we obtain a similar result for modules v with stable endomorphism ring k belonging to an arbitrary nilpotent block with defect group d this confirms for such v conjectures on the ring structure of the universal deformation ring of v which had previously been shown for v belonging to cyclic blocks or to blocks with klein four defect groups,0
we analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum according to the corresponding fermats principle in the general relativity we derived a graded refractive index of vacuum in a static gravitational field we found that the light deflection in a gravitational field can be calculated correctly with the use of this refractive index and therefore the gravitational lensing can be treated conveniently with the optical method for illustration we simulated the imaging of gravitational lensing figured out the time delay between the two images and calculated the lens mass in a conventional optical way,0
the core of the vortex in the neel order parameter for an easyplane antiferromagnet on honeycomb lattice is demonstrated to bind two zeroenergy states remarkably a single electron occupying this midgap band has its spin fragmented between the two sublattices whereas it yields a vanishing total magnetization it shows a finite neel order orthogonal to the one of the assumed background the requisite easyplane anisotropy may be introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the graphene layer for example the results are relevant for spin12 fermions on graphenes or optical honeycomb lattice in the strongly interacting regime,0
there is evidence for the existence of massive planets at orbital radii of several hundred au from their parent stars where the timescale for planet formation by core accretion is longer than the disc lifetime these planets could have formed close to their star and then migrated outwards we consider how the transfer of angular momentum by viscous disc interactions from a massive inner planet could cause significant outward migration of a smaller outer planet we find that it is in principle possible for planets to migrate to large radii we note however a number of effects which may render the process somewhat problematic,0
the compatibility of the pure power law infrared solution of qcd and lattice data for the gluon and ghost propagators in landau gauge is discussed for the gluon propagator the lattice data is well described by a pure power law with an infrared exponent kappa sim 053 in the dysonschwinger notation kappa is measured using a technique that suppresses finite volume effects this value implies a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator in agreement with the gribovzwanziger confinement scenario for the ghost propagator the lattice data seem not to follow a pure power law at least for the range of momenta accessed in our simulation,0
we demonstrate that the strong anomalies in the high frequency lophonon spectrum in cuprate superconductors can in principle be explained by the enhanced electronic polarizability associated with the selforganized one dimensionality of metallic stripes contrary to the current interpretation in terms of transversal stripe fluctuations the anomaly should occur at momenta parallel to the stripes the doping dependence of the anomaly is naturally explained and we predict that the phonon linewidth and the spread of the anomaly in the transverse momentum decrease with increasing temperature while high resolution measurements should reveal a characteristic substructure to the anomaly,0
the computation of radiative energy loss in a dynamically screened qcd medium is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions we calculate to first order in the opacity the energy loss suffered by a heavy quark traveling through an infinite and timeindependent qcd medium and show that the result for a dynamical medium is almost twice that obtained previously for a medium consisting of randomly distributed static scattering centers a quantitative description of jet suppression in rhic and lhc experiments thus must correctly account for the dynamics of the mediums constituents,0
all realistic potential models for the twonucleon interaction are to some extent based on boson exchange however in order to achieve an essentially perfect fit to the scattering data characterized by a chi2ndata  1 previous potentials have abandoned a pure one bosonexchange mechanism obe using a covariant theory we have found a obe potential that fits the 2006 world np data below 350 mev with a chi2ndata  106 for 3788 data our potential has fewer adjustable parameters than previous highprecision potentials and also reproduces the experimental triton binding energy without introducing additional irreducible threenucleon forces,0
andersons orthogonality catastrophe in graphene at energies close to the dirac point is analyzed it is shown that in clean systems the orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed due to the vanishing density of states at the dirac point in the presence of preexisting localized states at the dirac energy the orthogonality catastrophe shows similar features to those found in normal metals with a finite density of states at the fermi level the implications for the kondo effect induced by magnetic impurities and for the fermi edge singularities in tunneling processes are also discussed,0
the study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps available results are reduced to a generalized eulerlagrange equation that contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories in this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of duboisreymond for variational problems with compositions with the help of the new obtained condition a noethertype theorem is proved an application of our main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one consider maps that are ergodic,0
we present experimental results on the relaxation dynamics of vesicles subjected to a timedependent elongation flow we observed and characterized a new instability which results in the formation of higher order modes of the vesicle shape wrinkles after a switch in the direction of the gradient of the velocity this surprising generation of membrane wrinkles can be explained by the appearance of a negative surface tension during the vesicle deflation due to compression in a signswitching transient moreover the formation of buds in the vesicle membrane has been observed in the vicinity of the dynamical transition point,0

we consider the lightest scalar meson in the frame of the su_l2times su_r2 linear sigma model keeping in mind that this model could be the low energy realization of the twoflavour qcd we show that the sigma field is described by its fourquark component at least in the sigma resonance energy virtuality region and the sigmatogammagamma decay is the four quark transition we emphasize that residues of the sigma pole in the pipitopipi and gammagammatopipi amplitudes do not give an idea about the sigma meson nature and the progress in studying the sigma meson production mechanisms in different processes could essentially further us in understanding its nature,0
a probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic description of the detection of scattered photons the resulting probabilities can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special functions these exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small distances and limited time residuals due to computer accuracy limitations in this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different regions of the distancetime residual space defined by the detector geometry and the spacetime scale of an event these approximations can be evaluated numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the boundaries of less than 0001,0
we present a lattice boltzmann algorithm based on an underlying free energy that allows the simulation of the dynamics of a multicomponent system with an arbitrary number of components the thermodynamic properties such as the chemical potential of each component and the pressure of the overall system are incorporated in the model we derived a symmetrical convection diffusion equation for each component as well as the navier stokes equation and continuity equation for the overall system the algorithm was verified through simulations of binary and ternary systems the equilibrium concentrations of components of binary and ternary systems simulated with our algorithm agree well with theoretical expectations,0
using threedimensional kp calculation including strain and piezoelectricity we showed that the size of the quantum dot qd in the growth direction determines the influence of the ingaas capping layer on the optical properties of 11k grown inas qds where k123 for flat dots increase of in concentration in the capping layer leads to a decrease of the transition energy as is the case of 001 grown qds whereas for large dots an increase of the in concentration in the capping layer is followed by an increase of the transition energy up to a critical concentration of in after which the optical transition energy starts to decrease,0

we provide the explicit combinatorial structure of the kirillovreshetikhin crystals brs of type d_n1 b_n1 and a_2n12 this is achieved by constructing the crystal analogue sigma of the automorphism of the d_n1 resp b_n1 or a_2n12 dynkin diagram that interchanges the 0 and 1 node the involution sigma is defined in terms of new plusminus diagrams that govern the d_n to d_n1 resp b_n to b_n1 or c_n to c_n1 branching it is also shown that the crystal brs is perfect these crystals have been implemented in mupadcombinat the implementation is discussed in terms of many examples,0
computer simulations were done of the mean square displacement msd of tracer particles in colloidal gels formed by diffusion or reaction limited aggregation of hard spheres the diffusion coefficient was found to be determined by the volume fraction accessible to the spherical tracers phi_a independent of the gel structure or the tracer size in all cases critical slowing down was observed at phi_aapprox 003 and was characterized by the same scaling laws reported earlier for tracer diffusion in a lorentz gas strong heterogeneity of the msd was observed at small phi_a and was related to the size distribution of pores,0
the nature of nonexponential kinetics in microbial cells inactivation by pulsed electric fields pef is discussed it was demonstrated that possible mechanism of nonexponential kinetics can be related to orientational disorder in suspension of microbial cells of anisotropic form a numerical studies of spheroidal cell suspensions was carried out the most pronounced deviations from the exponential kinetics were observed for disordered suspensions of prolate spheroids at small electric field strength e or at large aspect ratio a for partially oriented suspensions efficiency of inactivation enhances with increasing of order parameter and field strength a possibility of the pefinduced orientational ordering in microbial suspensions is discussed,0
in previous work an ordering result was given for the symbolwise probability of error using general markov channels under iterative decoding of ldpc codes in this paper the ordering result is extended to mutual information under the assumption of an iid input distribution for certain channels in which the capacityachieving input distribution is iid this allows ordering of the channels by capacity the complexity of analyzing general markov channels is mitigated by this ordering since it is possible to immediately determine that a wide class of channels with different numbers of states has a smaller mutual information than a given channel,0

zeroknowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be used as a basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols an intrinsic characteristic of a zeroknowledge systems is the assumption that is impossible for the verifier to show to a third part that he has interacted with the prover however it has been shown that using quantum correlations the impossibility of transferring proofs can be successfully attacked in this work we show two new protocols for proof transference being the first one based on teleportation and the second one without using entangled states,0
we derive fourdimensional 4d effective theories of the gaugehiggs unification models in the warped spacetime the effective action can be expressed in a simple form by neglecting subleading corrections to the wave functions we have shown in our previous works that some higgs couplings to the other fields are suppressed by factors that depend on bartheta_h from the values in the standard model here bartheta_h is the wilson line phase along the fifth dimension which characterizes the electroweak symmetry breaking the effective action derived here explicitly shows a nonlinear structure of the higgs sector which clarifies the origins of those suppression factors,0
we give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed equivariant total chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed bundles by a linear group action this fine moduli scheme is described explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions we use this description to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy murphys law in the sense of vakil the preliminary sections of the paper give a selfcontained introduction to klyachkos classification of toric vector bundles,0

we investigate dynamical stability of the ground state against a timeperiodic and spatiallyinhomogeneous magnetic field for finite quantum xxz spin chains we use the survival probability as a measure of stability and demonstrate that it decays as pt propto t12 under a certain condition the dynamical properties should also be related to the level statistics of the xxz spin chains with a constant spatiallyinhomogeneous magnetic field the level statistics depends on the anisotropy parameter and the field strength we show how the survival probability depends on the anisotropy parameter the strength and frequency of the field,0
this paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards the technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted high level language the rank file and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board the attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares finally rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method,0
the walecka manybody field theory is investigated in the context of quantum nonextensive statistical mechanics characterized by a dimensionless parameter q we consider nuclear matter described statistically by a powerlaw distribution which generalizes the standard fermidirac distribution q  1 we show that the scalar and vector meson fields become more intense due to the nonextensive effects q neq 1 from a numerical treatment we also show that as the nonextensive parameter q increases the nucleon effective mass diminishes and the equation of state becomes stiffer finally the usual maxwell construction seems not to be necessary for isotherms with temperatures in the range 14 mevk_bt20 mev,0
particle in cell pic simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a distinct twoscale structure along the outflow direction the length of the electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass approaching the ion inertial length for a protonelectron plasma a surprise however is that the electrons form a highvelocity outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the xline the rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons,0
we consider the stability of a compressible shear flow separating two streams of different speeds and temperatures the velocity and temperature profiles in this mixing layer are hyperbolic tangents the normal mode analysis of the flow stability reduces to an eigenvalue problem for the pressure perturbation we briefly describe the numerical method that we used to solve this problem then we introduce the notions of the absolute and convective instabilities and examine the effects of mach number and the velocity and temperature ratios of each stream on the transition between convective and absolute instabilities finally we discuss the implication of the results presented in this paper for the heliopause stability,0
we studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on electronphonon ep interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates at subkelvin temperatures the power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using sensitive normal metalinsulatorsuperconductor nis tunnel junction thermometers membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to clearly see the onset of the effects of twodimensional 2d phonon system we observed for the first time that a 2d phonon spectrum clearly changes the temperature dependence and strength of the ep scattering rate with the interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below sim 05 k for the 30 nm membranes,0
energetically the single sheet of graphite graphene is more stable than the nanotube the energy difference between the two systems can be directly related to the strain energy involved in rolling up the graphene sheet to form the nanotube we have carried out first principle electronic structure calculations and evaluated the strain energy as a function of the nanotube radius the dependence of the strain energy on the diameter of the nanotube has been found by several groups to be welldescribed by a continuum elasticity model we attempt to examine why this is the case and show where atomistics enter the description,0

for symplectic group actions which are not hamiltonian there are two ways to define reduction firstly using the cylindervalued momentum map and secondly lifting the action to any hamiltonian cover such as the universal cover and then performing symplectic reduction in the usual way we show that provided the action is free and proper and the hamiltonian holonomy associated to the action is closed the natural projection from the latter to the former is a symplectic cover at the same time we give a classification of all hamiltonian covers of a given symplectic group action the main properties of the lifting of a group action to a cover are studied,0

security of the threeparty quantum secret sharing qss schemes based on entanglement and a collective eavesdropping check is analyzed in the case of considerable quantum channel losses an opaque attack scheme is presented for the dishonest agent to eavesdrop the message obtained by the other agent freely which reveals that these qss schemes are insecure for transmission efficiencies lower than 50 especially when they are used to share an unknown quantum state finally we present a general way to improve the security of qss schemes for sharing not only a private key but also an unknown quantum state,0
it has been recently shown that the quantum boltzmann equations may be relevant for the leptogenesis scenario in particular they lead to a timedependent cp asymmetry which depends upon the previous dynamics of the system this memory effect in the cp asymmetry is particularly important in resonant leptogenesis where the asymmetry is generated by the decays of nearly massdegenerate righthanded neutrinos we study the impact of the nontrivial time evolution of the cp asymmetry in resonant leptogenesis both in the oneflavour case and with flavour effects included we show that significant qualitative and quantitative differences arise with respect to the case in which the time dependence of the cp asymmetry is neglected,0
in this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of feynman graphs and dysonschwinger equations starting from lie and hopf algebras of feynman graphs perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically the hochschild cohomology of these hopf algebras leads the way to slavnovtaylor identities and dysonschwinger equations we discuss recent progress in solving simple dysonschwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory understanding feynman integrals as periods of mixed tate motives,0
we systematically evaluate the potential energy at the touching configuration for heavyion reactions using various potential models we point out that the energy at the touching point especially that estimated with the krappenixsierk kns potential strongly correlates with the threshold incident energy for steep falloff of fusion cross sections observed recently for several systems at extremely low energies this clearly indicates that the steep falloff phenomenon can be attributed to the dynamics after the target and projectile touch with each other eg the tunneling process and the nuclear saturation property in the overlap region,0

for a kahler manifold x we study a space of test functions w which is a complex version of h1 we prove for w the classical results of the theory of dirichlet spaces the functions in w are defined up to a pluripolar set and the functional capacity associated to w tests the pluripolar sets this functional capacity is a choquet capacity the space w is not reflexive and the smooth functions are not dense in it for the strong topology so the classical tools of potential theory do not apply here we use instead pluripotential theory and dirichlet spaces associated to a current,0
conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of leverlike structures using a simple theoretical model we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable eg at a localized hinge surprisingly the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge in this intermediate regime the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of cargo attached to the lever arm which could be exploited by molecular motors to explain this effect we generalize the kramerslanger theory for multidimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices,0
in a ring of swave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized in units of phi_0  frach2e it is well known from the theory of josephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of dwave material then the flux is quantized in onehalf of those units due to a additional phase shift of pi we reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of geometric phase we consider an idealized heterojunction superconductor with pure swave and pure dwave electron pairs we find for this idealized configuration that the phase shift of pi follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and is thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics,0

we perform molecular dynamics simulation of water using the tip5p model to quantify structural order in both the first shell defined by four nearest neighborsand second shell defined by twelve nextnearest neighbors of a central water molecule we find the anomalous decrease of orientational order upon compression occurs in both shells but the anomalous decrease of translational order upon compression occurs it mainly in the second shell the decreases of translational and orientational orders upon compression structural anomaly are thus correlated only in the second shell our findings quantitatively confirm the qualitative idea that the thermodynamic dynamic and structural anomalies of water are related to changes in the second shell upon compression,0

the longranged elastic model which is believed to describe the evolution of a selfaffine rough crackfront is analyzed to linear and nonlinear orders it is shown that the nonlinear terms while important in changing the front dynamics are not changing the scaling exponent which characterizes the roughness of the front the scaling exponent thus predicted by the model is much smaller than the one observed experimentally the inevitable conclusion is that the gap between the results of experiments and the model that is supposed to describe them is too large and some new physics has to be invoked for another model,0

a scaleinvariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials the scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field this instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field we show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the latetime attractor the final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the hubble scale at the transition,0

the averaged null energy condition anec requires that the integral over a complete null geodesic of the stressenergy tensor projected onto the geodesic tangent vector is never negative this condition is sufficient to prove many important theorems in general relativity but it is violated by quantum fields in curved spacetime however there is a weaker condition which is free of known violations requiring only that there is no selfconsistent spacetime in semiclassical gravity in which anec is violated on a complete em achronal null geodesic we indicate why such a condition might be expected to hold and show that it is sufficient to rule out wormholes and closed timelike curves,0
in the present work an alternative interpretation of the source of accelerated expansion of the universe is suggested a probable candidate is the interaction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of spacetime produced by the background gravitational field of the universe this interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work with some experimental and observational evidences for its existence it has been shown that this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force the accelerated expansion of the universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale,0
forward time step integrators are splitting algorithms with only positive splitting coefficients when used in solving physical evolution equations these positive coefficients correspond to positive time steps forward algorithms are essential for solving timeirreversible equations that cannot be evolved using backward time steps however forward integrators are also better in solving timereversible equations of classical dynamics by tracking as closely as possible the physical trajectory this work compares in detail various forward and nonforward fourthorder integrators using three fourth five and six force evaluations in the case of solving the 2d kepler orbit all nonforward integrators are optimized by simply minimizing the size of their backward time steps,0

using a general analytical continuation scheme for cluster dynamical mean field calculations we analyze realfrequency selfenergies momentumresolved spectral functions and oneparticle excitations of the metallic and insulating phases of vo2 while for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects prevent a description in terms of quasiparticles the excitations of the latter allow for an effective bandstructure we construct an orbitaldependent but static oneparticle potential that reproduces the full manybody spectrum yet the ground state is well beyond a static oneparticle description the emerging picture gives a nontrivial answer to the decadeold question of the nature of the insulator which we characterize as a manybody peierls state,0
we study the survival of substructures clumps within larger selfgravitating dark matter halos building on scaling relations obtained from nbody calculations of violent relaxation we argue that the tidal field of galaxies and halos can only destroy substructures if spherical symmetry is imposed at formation we explore other mechanisms that may tailor the number of halo substructures during the course of virialization unless the larger halo is built up from a few large clumps we find that clumpclump encounters are unlikely to homogenize the halo on a dynamical timescale phase mixing would proceed faster in the inner parts and allow for the secular evolution of a stellar disk,0

the discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation in contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization together with a finetuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur the energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations,0

the blowup in finite time for the solutions to the initialboundary value problem associated to the multidimensional quantum hydrodynamic model in a bounded domain is proved the model consists on conservation of mass equation and a momentum balance equation equivalent to a compressible euler equations corrected by a dispersion term of the third order in the momentum balance the proof is based on apriori estimates for the energy functional for a new observable constructed with an auxiliary function and it is shown that under suitable boundary conditions and assumptions on the initial data the solution blows up after a finite time,0

we numerically investigated the connection between isobaric fragility and the properties of highorder stationary points of the potential energy surface in different supercooled lennardjones mixtures the increase of effective activation energies upon supercooling appears to be driven by the increase of average potential energy barriers measured by the energy dependence of the fraction of unstable modes such an increase is sharper the more fragile is the mixture correlations between fragility and other properties of highorder stationary points including the vibrational density of states and the localization features of unstable modes are also discussed,0

translating a text from one language to another is challenging for several reasons translators must convey not just the words but also the nuances cultural context and style of the original language direct wordforword translations often fail to capture the full meaning requiring the translator to make judgement calls and creative decisions to produce an output text that communicates the same message to a new audience adjustments to syntax vocabulary length and structure must be made carefully balancing precision concision and style translation involves transforming concepts across languages and cultures it is as much an art as a science and perfect translations are rare,1

euclids geometry provides a wellknown example of deductive reasoning in mathematics euclid began with axioms and definitions as premises then deduced new geometric truths as theorems using proof by contradiction and other forms of logical demonstration10 for example euclid proved the pythagorean theorem  that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides  deductively from definitions common notions and previously established theorems11 euclids geometry epitomizes reasoning down from general axioms to specific results illustrating deductions central role in the mathematical enterprise,1
8 implement additional improvements and optimizations when possible as your algorithm is tested more extensively and used in realworld scenarios opportunities for improvements may emerge consider  reducing time or space complexity to improve efficiency  adding additional features to enhance functionality  handling new types of input data or edge cases not previously considered reimplement sections of your code or rewrite parts of your pseudocode as needed to integrate the optimizations then repeat the testing refinement and review cycle to ensure the improved algorithm still works correctly and as intended algorithm development is an iterative process of continuous evolution and enhancement,1
in summary while simplicity is the ultimate sophistication captures part of the truth a more nuanced perspective recognizes simplicity and sophistication as mutually reinforcing true sophistication understands when simplicity is called for and can simplify complexity through careful analysis while simple concepts and practices can convey elegance and refinement complex ideas requiring intricate thinking and reasoning often demonstrate a greater degree of intellectual sophistication therefore instead of arguing that simplicity alone equates to sophistication a more holistic view appreciates both simplicity and complexity as vehicles for sophistication when appropriately balanced through reasoned judgment,1
during their final battle one of the ways naruto counters sasukes chidori is by using his shadow clone jutsu to create multiple copies of himself that distract and confuse sasuke as sasukes chidori requires focus and precision to unleash its full power the sudden swarm of naruto clones disorients him and makes it difficult to land a direct hit on the real naruto this buys naruto time to either safely evade the chidori attack or prepare his own rasengan to stop sasukes attack by creating a numbers advantage through shadow cloning naruto can neutralize the deadly potential of sasukes chidori and gain the upper hand in their fight,1

businesses produce supply of goods and services based on what they think customers will demand at certain price points consumers then express their demand based on how much value the products provide at the prices offered the interaction of supply and demand determines the equilibrium price  the price at which the amount suppliers are willing to sell equals the amount that consumers want to buy if supply exceeds demand prices fall until balance is achieved and if demand exceeds supply prices rise until balance is achieved hopefully this provides a basic yet reasonable conceptual understanding of supply and demand,1
one additional line of evidence supporting the endosymbiotic theory is protein import mitochondria and chloroplasts import many nuclearencoded proteins into their matrix and lumen respectively the import mechanisms and protein transit sequences resemble those used by bacteria to transport proteins across their plasma membranes this suggests the protein import systems originated in the endosymbiotic progenitors and were maintained after endosymbiosis the eukaryotic cell had to develop a mechanism to feed proteins encoded by the nucleus into the endosymbionts which mirrored the preexisting bacterial protein import system the retained protein import ability provides further evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts arose through endosymbiosis of ancient bacteria,1

to conclude we have shown through a constructive geometric argument that the square of the length of the hypotenuse c of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs a and b this key relationship known as the pythagorean theorem can be expressed mathematically as c2  a2  b2 where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b represent the lengths of the legs of the right triangle the proof provided insight into deeper geometric concepts and principles revealing the interconnectivity of shapes and measurements in our world,1
while positive and natural law are conceptually distinct in practice they often intersect and relate positive laws may be enacted to uphold principles of natural law such as laws against murder aligning with the natural right to life however positive laws do not always match perfectly with natural law they represent societal compromises and policy judgments further natural law theorists differ on which specific moral principles constitute universal natural law there are therefore debates about the extent to which positive laws comport with natural law nevertheless the concepts are closely connected and have influenced each other throughout history,1

to summarize the pythagorean theorem provides a fundamental relationship between the sides of a right triangle  the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides this simple yet powerful equation has many practical applications it allows us to determine the length of an unknown side given the other two sides which is useful for calculations in construction architecture and engineering the pythagorean theorem enables scientists astronomers and engineers to calculate distances that are too large to measure directly including distances across the universe,1
the argument that all textbooks should be freely available online makes assumptions that cost is the main barrier to access and making texts free would sufficiently motivate authors counterarguments include concerns about quality control and copyright issues with unpaid authors and unregulated free online texts strengthening the argument would require data on current cost barriers and evidence that free online texts do not degrade learning outcomes argument 1 relies on appeal to authority from experts which though not infallible provides a more reliable starting point than argument 2s assumption about consequences following from an alleged threat though not definitive argument 1s reasoning from expert opinion seems most logically sound,1

a strategy or roleplaying game with conflicting objectives seems suitable a political or historical theme where players represent different factions could work well  game mechanics that require players to make formal proposals concessions and vote on decisions would promote negotiation alliances that shift during gameplay also help  a narrative with contrasting ideologies that also creates interdependence between players can motivate players to negotiate and cooperate  graphics and components that visually represent the theme help bring the mechanics to life in a thematic way  chance elements like event cards and variable player powers can add variety but should complement the focus on diplomacy not overshadow it,1
in summary the key takeaways regarding why objects fall at the same rate are  according to newtons law gravitational force depends on mass but produces the same acceleration for different masses due to differences in inertia  in a vacuum objects would fall at rates depending on their mass  in the real world air resistance counters much of the gravitational force for lightweight objects minimizing the impact of mass and producing nearly uniform acceleration  discovering that objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass helped pave the way for general relativity which resolved inconsistencies in newtonian gravity and revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe,1

a limit finds the value that a function approaches as the input tends toward a specific value even if the function cannot produce an output for that exact input  we can find limits through direct substitution by plugging the limit value directly into the function  we can also find limits graphically by plotting the function and observing the output values as the input trends toward the limit value  in cases where direct substitution and the graph agree we have more confidence in the limit value  however in some cases a limit may exist graphically but not through direct substitution if the function is undefined at the limit point,1

in summary by combining deductive and inductive reasoning we overcome the individual limitations of each approach to arrive at conclusions that are both more certain yet also accommodate complexity while deduction derives logically necessary conclusions from true premises induction draws plausible inferences from evidence which testing through experimentation can inform the synergy of deduction and induction thus yields inferences that are more accurate and complete as hypotheses tested deductively against evidence refined inductively yields results that exceed what either approach alone can achieve the complementarity of deductive and inductive reasoning thus allows for conclusions with greater certainty and comprehensiveness,1

waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men,0
an active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars dust and gas it is powered by a compact region at the core thought to be a supermassive black hole that is emitting radiation from infalling material 907 a radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas active galaxies that emit shorter frequency highenergy radiation include seyfert galaxies quasars and blazars quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe,0
in particle physics the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model have begun to appear foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have nonzero mass these experimental results appear to have solved the longstanding solar neutrino problem and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research the large hadron collider has already found the higgs boson but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry which extends the standard model of particle physics research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing,0
with diverging lenses incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the lens in such a way that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens this is the lenss front focal point rays from an object at a finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point and on the same side of the lens as the object the closer the object is to the lens the closer the virtual image is to the lens as with mirrors upright images produced by a single lens are virtual while inverted images are real,0
left ventricular assist devices are often used as a bridge to provide additional time while a patient waits for a transplant for example former us vicepresident dick cheney had such a device implanted in 2010 and then 20 months later received a heart transplant in 2012 in year 2012 about 3000 ventricular assist devices were inserted in the united states as compared to approximately 2500 heart transplants the use of airbags in cars as well as greater use of helmets by bicyclists and skiers has reduced the number of persons with fatal head injuries which is a common source of donors hearts,0
dietary meat consumption particularly consumption of red and processed meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer there appears to be a metabolic link between a fat and meat rich diet and cancer associated gut microbes in the colonic contents of humans on a high fat diet the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid produced from the primary bile acid cholic acid by the gut microbiota is increased and this increase is associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer in populations that have a high incidence of colorectal cancer fecal concentrations of bile acids particularly deoxycholic acid produced by the action of gut microbiota are higher,0
one important branch attempts to better understand the standard model and its tests theorists make quantitative predictions of observables at collider and astronomical experiments which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the standard model with less uncertainty this work probes the limits of the standard model and therefore expands scientific understanding of natures building blocks those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating high precision quantities in quantum chromodynamics some theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative quantum field theory and effective field theory referring to themselves as phenomenologistscitation needed others make use of lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theorists,0
neuromorphic quantum computing abbreviated as nquantum computing is an unconventional type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations it was suggested that quantum algorithms which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing both traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physicsbased unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von neumann architecture they both construct a system a circuit that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the minimum neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation,0
in a 2015 article reviewing research on the use of a mobile health application in the united kingdom authors describe how a homebased application helped patients manage and monitor their health and symptoms independently the mobile health application allows people to rapidly selfreport their symptoms  95 of patients were able to report their daily symptoms in less than 100 seconds which is less than the 5 minutes plus commuting taken to measure vital signs by nurses in hospitals online applications allow patients to remain at home to keep track of the progression of their chronic illnesses the downside of using mhealth applications is that not everyone especially in developing countries has daily access to internet or electronic devices,0
in computer science simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of ingo rechenberg in the 1960s he used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of john henry holland practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multidimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems,0
thermodynamics is concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work it defines macroscopic variables such as internal energy entropy and pressure that partly describe a body of matter or radiation it states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints common to all materials these general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents such as molecules the behavior of these microscopic particles is described by and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from statistical mechanics,0
for temperature studies subjects must remain awake but calm and semireclined in near darkness while their rectal temperatures are taken continuously though variation is great among normal chronotypes the average human adults temperature reaches its minimum at about 500 am about two hours before habitual wake time baehr et al found that in young adults the daily body temperature minimum occurred at about 0400 4 am for morning types but at about 0600 6 am for evening types this minimum occurred at approximately the middle of the eighthour sleep period for morning types but closer to waking in evening types,0
nextgeneration sequencing or highthroughput sequencing came about due to the everincreasing demand for lowcost sequencing these sequencing technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently the large amount of sequence data available has created the subfield of genomics research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms genomics can also be considered a subfield of bioinformatics which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data a common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable informationcitation needed,0
the planets were formed 46 billion years ago in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early sun through a process that included gravitational attraction collision and accretion the disk formed clumps of matter that with time became protoplanets the radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere the planets continued to sweep up or eject the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment evidenced by the many impact craters on the moon during this period some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the moon,0
the first bimaristan was founded in baghdad in the 9th century and several others of increasing complexity were created throughout the arab world in the following centuries some of the bimaristans contained wards dedicated to the care of mentally ill patients during the middle ages psychiatric hospitals and lunatic asylums were built and expanded throughout europe specialist hospitals such as bethlem royal hospital in london were built in medieval europe from the 13th century to treat mental disorders but were used only as custodial institutions and did not provide any type of treatment it is the oldest extant psychiatric hospital in the world,0
by the year 1991 most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish the field was reinvigorated in may 1991 when physicists philip candelas xenia de la ossa paul green and linda parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to translate difficult mathematical questions about one calabiyau manifold into easier questions about its mirror in particular they used mirror symmetry to show that a sixdimensional calabiyau manifold can contain exactly 317206375 curves of degree three in addition to counting degreethree curves candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians,0
the environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes it is dynamically interlinked and contains resources for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle like ecology the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature environment includes the physical world the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation 62 the physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation including abiotic factors such as temperature radiation light chemistry climate and geology the biotic environment includes genes cells organisms members of the same species conspecifics and other species that share a habitat,0
more specific and widely reaching laws legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology they will have to be fully agreed upon for example will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too or could there be a limited use telehealth licence would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions or only some who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help  would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times which state city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred,0
thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions when this rule is broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion however the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in wellseparated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons creating radicals most radicals are comparatively reactive but some such as nitric oxide no can be stable,0
studies have shown that maintaining normal sleep and circadian rhythms is important for many aspects of brain and health a number of studies have also indicated that a powernap a short period of sleep during the day can reduce stress and may improve productivity without any measurable effect on normal circadian rhythms circadian rhythms also play a part in the reticular activating system which is crucial for maintaining a state of consciousness a reversalclarification needed in the sleepwake cycle may be a sign or complication of uremia azotemia or acute kidney injury studies have also helped elucidate how light has a direct effect on human health through its influence on the circadian biology,0
excessive consumption of energydense foods and drinks and limited physical activity causes overnutrition it causes overweight defined as a body mass index bmi of 25 or more and can lead to obesity a bmi of 30 or more obesity has become a major health issue worldwide overnutrition is linked to chronic noncommunicable diseases like diabetes certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases hence identifying and addressing the immediate risk factors has become a major health priority the recent evidence on the impact of dietinduced obesity in fathers and mothers around the time of conception is identified to negatively program the health outcomes of multiple generations,0
predicting short or longterm survival depends on many factors the most important are the cancer type and the patients age and overall health those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful people who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer people with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications andor disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life additionally patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatalcitation needed,0
sickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits such as illness benefits work avoidance and being looked after by others the person who is sick takes on a social role called the sick role a person who responds to a dreaded disease such as cancer in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher social status in return for these benefits the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more as a comparison consider pregnancy which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care,0
development of the field of clinical informatics led to the creation of large data sets with electronic health record data integrated with other data such as genomic data types of data repositories include operational data stores odss clinical data warehouses cdws clinical data marts and clinical registries operational data stores established for extracting transferring and loading before creating warehouse or data marts clinical registries repositories have long been in existence but their contents are disease specific and sometimes considered archaic clinical data stores and clinical data warehouses are considered fast and reliable though these large integrated repositories have impacted clinical research significantly it still faces challenges and barriers,0
in 1993 andrew gobea was born with scid following prenatal genetic screening blood was removed from his mothers placenta and umbilical cord immediately after birth to acquire stem cells the allele that codes for adenosine deaminase ada was obtained and inserted into a retrovirus retroviruses and stem cells were mixed after which the viruses inserted the gene into the stem cell chromosomes stem cells containing the working ada gene were injected into andrews blood injections of the ada enzyme were also given weekly for four years t cells white blood cells produced by stem cells made ada enzymes using the ada gene after four years more treatment was needed,0
furthermore physical training has also generally been seen to be an effective antagonist of insulin resistance in obese or overweight children and adolescents under the age of 19 as per the 2016 systematic review and metaanalysis conducted by marson et al aerobic exercise is associated with fasting insulin reduction however resistance and combined exercise are not the authors caution against demeaning the importance of resistance and combined exercise as this type of training is generally less researched than aerobic training overall physical training can be used in both adolescents and adults to prevent the progression of insulin resistance and future possible metabolic and cardiovascular disease,0
the diaphragm is an important part of the bodys digestive system the muscular diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity where most of the digestive organs are located the suspensory muscle attaches the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm this muscle is thought to be of help in the digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the duodenojejunal flexure for the easier passage of digesting material the diaphragm also attaches to and anchors the liver at its bare area the esophagus enters the abdomen through a hole in the diaphragm at the level of t10,0
as per chapter 300 of the compendium of us copyright office practices the office will not register works produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author including medical imaging produced by xrays ultrasounds magnetic resonance imaging or other diagnostic equipment this position differs from the broad copyright protections afforded to photographs while the copyright compendium is an agency statutory interpretation and not legally binding courts are likely to give deference to it if they find it reasonable yet there is no us federal case law directly addressing the issue of the copyrightability of xray images,0

in the global context the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades supported by institutions such as the world health organization and the world bank among others operational structures are formulated by strategic principles with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks all requiring modulation according to local national and global realities moreover integrating technology or digital platforms to connect to low health literacy lhl groups could be a way to increase health literacy it is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity and not depend on other countries to supply it,0
the term often refers specifically to triglycerides triple esters of glycerol that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty tissue in animals or even more narrowly to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature thus excluding oils the term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipidany substance of biological relevance composed of carbon hydrogen or oxygen that is insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar solvents in this sense besides the triglycerides the term would include several other types of compounds like mono and diglycerides phospholipids such as lecithin sterols such as cholesterol waxes such as beeswax and free fatty acids which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts,0
childrens environmental health is the academic discipline that studies how environmental exposures in early lifechemical biological nutritional and socialinfluence health and development in childhood and across the entire human life span pediatric environmental health is based on the recognition that children are not little adults infants and children have unique patterns of exposure and vulnerabilities environmental risks of infants and children are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of adults pediatric environmental health is highly interdisciplinary it spans and brings together general pediatrics and numerous pediatric subspecialties as well as epidemiology occupational and environmental medicine medical toxicology industrial hygiene and exposure science,0
natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula ch2on where n is three or more a typical monosaccharide has the structure hchohxcochohyh that is an aldehyde or ketone with many hydroxyl groups added usually one on each carbon atom that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone functional group examples of monosaccharides are glucose fructose and glyceraldehydes however some biological substances commonly called monosaccharides do not conform to this formula eg uronic acids and deoxysugars such as fucose and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides eg formaldehyde ch2o and inositol ch2o6).,0
insulin is a hormone that facilitates the transport of glucose from blood into cells thereby reducing blood glucose blood sugar insulin is released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrates consumed in the diet in states of insulin resistance the same amount of insulin does not have the same effect on glucose transport and blood sugar levels there are many causes of insulin resistance and the underlying process is still not completely understood risk factors for insulin resistance include obesity sedentary lifestyle family history of diabetes various health conditions and certain medications insulin resistance is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome insulin resistance can be improved or reversed with lifestyle approaches such as weight reduction exercise and dietary changes,0
"each additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space as an example the vector 1200  1201 represents a twoqubit state a tensor product of the qubit 0 with the qubit 120  121 this vector inhabits a fourdimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors 00 01 10 and 11 the bell state 1200  1211 is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubitsthe two qubits are entangled because neither qubit has a state vector of its own in general the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2n-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.",0
the distinction between essential and nonessential amino acids is somewhat unclear as some amino acids can be produced from others the sulfurcontaining amino acids methionine and homocysteine can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized de novo in humans likewise cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own so for convenience sulfurcontaining amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair phenylalanine and tyrosine likewise arginine ornithine and citrulline which are interconvertible by the urea cycle are considered a single groupcitation needed,0
sleep problems have been frequently viewed as a symptom of mental illness rather than a causative factor however a growing body of evidence suggests that they are both a cause and a symptom of mental illness insomnia is a significant predictor of major depressive disorder a metaanalysis of 170000 people showed that insomnia at the beginning of a study period indicated a more than the twofold increased risk for major depressive disorder some studies have also indicated correlation between insomnia and anxiety posttraumatic stress disorder and suicide sleep disorders can increase the risk of psychosis and worsen the severity of psychotic episodes,0
some antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs are used in chronic pain management and act primarily within the pain pathways of the central nervous system though peripheral mechanisms have been attributed as well they are generally used to treat nerve brain that results from injury to the nervous system neuropathy can be due to chronic high blood sugar levels diabetic neuropathy these drugs also reduce pain from viruses such as shingles phantom limb pain and poststroke pain these mechanisms vary and in general are more effective in neuropathic pain disorders as well as complex regional pain syndrome a common antiepileptic drug is gabapentin and an example of an antidepressant would be amitriptylinecitation needed,0
a 2024 goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by 2030 us data centers will consume 8 of us power as opposed to 3 in 2022 presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all,0

there is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries as well as within developing countries in developing countries public health infrastructures are still forming there may not be enough trained healthcare workers monetary resources or in some cases sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention a major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty coupled with governments reluctance in implementing public health policies developed nations are at greater risk of certain public health crises including childhood obesity although overweight populations in low and middleincome countries are catching up,0
food sources of dietary fiber have traditionally been divided according to whether they provide soluble or insoluble fiber plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying amounts according to the fiber characteristics of viscosity and fermentability advantages of consuming fiber depend upon which type is consumed bulking fibers  such as cellulose and hemicellulose including psyllium  absorb and hold water promoting bowel movement regularity viscous fibers  such as betaglucan and psyllium  thicken the fecal mass fermentable fibers  such as resistant starch xanthan gum and inulin  feed the bacteria and microbiota of the large intestine and are metabolized to yield shortchain fatty acids which have diverse roles in gastrointestinal health,0
many simplified approximations are available for analysing and designing optical systems most of these use a single scalar quantity to represent the electric field of the light wave rather than using a vector model with orthogonal electric and magnetic vectors the huygensfresnel equation is one such model this was derived empirically by fresnel in 1815 based on huygens hypothesis that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary spherical wavefront which fresnel combined with the principle of superposition of waves the kirchhoff diffraction equation which is derived using maxwells equations puts the huygensfresnel equation on a firmer physical foundation examples of the application of huygensfresnel principle can be found in the articles on diffraction and fraunhofer diffraction,0
prokaryotes ie archaea and bacteria can also undergo cell division or binary fission unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes binary fission in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell before binary fission dna in the bacterium is tightly coiled after it has uncoiled and duplicated it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium triggered by ftsz polymerization and zring formation the new cell wall septum fully develops resulting in the complete split of the bacterium the new daughter cells have tightly coiled dna rods ribosomes and plasmids,0
advances in lipid nanotechnology were instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications another system for microrna delivery under preliminary research is nanoparticles formed by the selfassembly of two different micrornas to possibly shrink tumors one potential application is based on small electromechanical systems such as nanoelectromechanical systems being investigated for the active release of drugs and sensors for possible cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells another system of drug delivery involving nanoparticles is the use of aquasomes selfassembled nanoparticles with a nanocrystalline center a coating made of a polyhydroxyl oligomer covered in the desired drug which protects it from dehydration and conformational change,0
the usda food pyramid was created in 1992 and divided into six horizontal sections containing depictions of foods from each sections food group it was updated in 2005 with black and white vertical wedges replacing the horizontal sections and renamed mypyramid mypyramid was often displayed with the food images absent creating a more abstract design in an effort to restructure food nutrition guidelines the usda rolled out its new myplate program in june 2011 my plate is divided into four slightly different sized quadrants with fruits and vegetables taking up half the space and grains and protein making up the other half the vegetables and grains portions are the largest of the four,0
during the first world war jones served as a territorial army surgeon he observed that treatment of fractures both at the front and in hospitals at home was inadequate and his efforts led to the introduction of military orthopedic hospitals he was appointed inspector of military orthopedics with responsibility for 30000 beds the hospital in ducane road hammersmith became the model for both british and american military orthopedic hospitals his advocacy of the use of thomas splint for the initial treatment of femoral fractures reduced mortality of open fractures of the femur from 87 to less than 8 in the period from 1916 to 1918,0

quantum parallelism is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously this can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated the resulting state encodes the functions output values for all input values in the superposition allowing for the computation of multiple outputs simultaneously this property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms however parallelism in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value to be useful a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient,0
in most countries it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered in general this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization which may ask the applicant to pass exams this restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards it is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain while the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in evidence based western or hippocratic medicine they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health,0
the clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an idealistic form of holism the term holism was coined in 1926 by jan christiaan smuts a south african general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by clements superorganism conceptc around the same time charles elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book animal ecology elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains food cycles and food size and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance eltons food cycle was replaced by food web in a subsequent ecological text alfred j lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology,0
systems thinking is a crucial part of usercentered design processes and is necessary to understand the whole impact of a new human computer interaction hci information system overlooking this and developing software without insights input from the future users mediated by user experience designers is a serious design flaw that can lead to complete failure of information systems increased stress and mental illness for users of information systems leading to increased costs and a huge waste of resources it is currently surprisingly uncommon for organizations and governments to investigate the project management decisions leading to serious design flaws and lack of usabilitycitation needed,0
food intolerance is more chronic less acute less obvious in its presentation and often more difficult to diagnose than a food allergy symptoms of food intolerance vary greatly and can be mistaken for the symptoms of a food allergy while true allergies are associated with fastacting immunoglobulin ige responses it can be difficult to determine the offending food causing a food intolerance because the response generally takes place over a prolonged period of time thus the causative agent and the response are separated in time and may not be obviously related food intolerance symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking the food in question but sometimes symptoms may be delayed by up to 48 hours,0
the immune system is a network of biological systems that protects an organism from diseases it detects and responds to a wide variety of pathogens from viruses to bacteria as well as cancer cells parasitic worms and also objects such as wood splinters distinguishing them from the organisms own healthy tissue many species have two major subsystems of the immune system the innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli the adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered both use molecules and cells to perform their functions,0

crocodilians are large lowslung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth the head and trunk are dorsoventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull the nostrils eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged unlike other reptiles crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood,0
kircher was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes and so he was well acquainted with the properties of lenses he wrote concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature investigated by microscope in 1646 stating who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms he also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcules he published his scrutinium pestis examination of the plague in 1658 stating correctly that the disease was caused by microbes though what he saw was most likely red or white blood cells rather than the plague agent itself,0
most skin cancer and sun protection data comes from australia and the united states an international study reported that australians tended to demonstrate higher knowledge of sun protection and skin cancer knowledge compared to other countries of children adolescents and adults sunscreen was the most commonly used skin protection however many adolescents purposely used sunscreen with a low sun protection factor spf in order to get a tan various australian studies have shown that many adults failed to use sunscreen correctly many applied sunscreen well after their initial sun exposure andor failed to reapply when necessary a 2002 casecontrol study in brazil showed that only 3 of case participants and 11 of control participants used sunscreen with spf 15,0
while psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity by many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role practicing psychotherapy in clinical counseling or school settings other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings eg universities medical schools or hospitals another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings yet others are involved in work on human development aging sports health forensic science education and the media,0
proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined by peptide bonds many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism other proteins have structural or mechanical functions such as those that form the cytoskeleton a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell shape proteins are also important in cell signaling immune responses cell adhesion active transport across membranes and the cell cycle amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle especially when a primary source of energy such as glucose is scarce or when cells undergo metabolic stress,0
relatively strong reducing acids can have antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing them from being absorbed examples are oxalic acid tannins and phytic acid which are high in plantbased diets calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread however germination soaking or microbial fermentation are all household strategies that reduce the phytate and polyphenol content of unrefined cereal increases in fe zn and ca absorption have been reported in adults fed dephytinized cereals compared with cereals containing their native phytate,0
health services researchers come from a variety of specializations including geography nursing economics political science epidemiology public health medicine biostatistics operations management engineering pharmacy psychology usability and user experience design while health services research is grounded in theory its underlying aim is to perform research that can be applied by physicians nurses health managers and administrators and other people who make decisions or deliver care in the health care system for example the application of epidemiological methods to the study of health services by managers is a type of health services research that can be described as managerial epidemiologycitation needed,0
for example it has become possible to understand in much detail the complex processes occurring within a single neuron neurons are cells specialized for communication they are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals influencing the activity of other neurons muscles or glands at their termination points a nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other in neural circuits and networks,0
a basic concept in some cbt treatments used in anxiety disorders is in vivo exposure cbtexposure therapy refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects activities or situations by a patient for example a woman with ptsd who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears likewise a person with a social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech this twofactor model is often credited to o hobart mowrer through exposure to the stimulus this harmful conditioning can be unlearned referred to as extinction and habituation,0
people who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with both the social and biological sciences the discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patients subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient psychiatry treats mental disorders which are conventionally divided into three general categories mental illnesses severe learning disabilities and personality disorders although the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so since the late 20th century the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields,0
sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patients blood nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes which are pencilsized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair,0
he greatly advanced knowledge of venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery including new methods for repairing damage to the achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries in case of an aneurysm he was also one of the first to understand the importance of pathology the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any benefit that was gained from the intervention he consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort,0
food intolerance rates were found to be similar in the population in norway out of 4622 subjects with adequately filledin questionnaires 84 were included in the study 18 perceived food intolerance is a common problem with significant nutritional consequences in a population with ibs of these 59 70 had symptoms related to intake of food 62 limited or excluded food items from the diet tests were performed for food allergy and malabsorption but not for intolerance there were no associations between the tests for food allergy and malabsorption and perceived food intolerance among those with ibs perceived food intolerance was unrelated to musculoskeletal pain and mood disorders,0
type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion the defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor however the specific defects are not known diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes mellitus accounting for 95 of diabetes many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes impaired fasting glucose andor impaired glucose tolerance before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes the progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the livers glucose production,0
in physics string theory is a theoretical framework in which the pointlike particles of particle physics are replaced by onedimensional objects called strings string theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other on distance scales larger than the string scale a string acts like a particle with its mass charge and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string in string theory one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity,0
as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere the upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the sun was sending more energy to earth but instead it has been cooling this is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the earths atmosphere,0
type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics a number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes including obesity defined by a body mass index of greater than 30 lack of physical activity poor diet such as western pattern diet stress and urbanization excess body fat is associated with 30 of cases in people of chinese and japanese descent 6080 of cases in those of european and african descent and 100 of pima indians and pacific islanders even those who are not obese may have a high waisthip ratio,0
multiple genes collectively influence the likelihood of developing many common and complex diseases personalised medicine can also be used to predict a persons risk for a particular disease based on one or even several genes this approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk allowing the physician to initiate preventive treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient for example if it is found that a dna mutation increases a persons risk of developing type 2 diabetes this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing type 2 diabetes later in lifecitation needed,0
the prominence of digital health in the past century has culminated for the emergence of three reasons stated by both professor john powell and professor theodoros n arvanitis the development of new technologies and also trends towards smart wearable and pervasive technologies the need for health services to find new approaches to addressing the demands of an ageing population and the role of the empowered patient and the shift in models of health service delivery towards patientcentred care and patientled care these three points have directed and motivated the rise in the elements that play a crucial role in the creation of digital health care services,0
tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do,0
emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide investigating the degree and severity of untreated emotional mental disorders throughout the world is a top priority of the world mental health wmh survey initiative which was created in 1998 by the world health organization who neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability worldwide accounting for 37 of all healthy life years lost through disease these disorders are most destructive to low and middleincome countries due to their inability to provide their citizens with proper aid despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints,0
furthermore nocturnal reactivation seems to share the same neural oscillatory patterns as reactivation during wakefulness processes which might be coordinated by theta activity during wakefulness theta oscillations have been often related to successful performance in memory tasks and cued memory reactivations during sleep have been showing that theta activity is significantly stronger in subsequent recognition of cued stimuli as compared to uncued ones possibly indicating a strengthening of memory traces and lexical integration by cuing during sleep however the beneficial effect of tmr for memory consolidation seems to occur only if the cued memories can be related to prior knowledge,0
across wild animals there is still limited data on cancer nonetheless a study published in 2022 explored cancer risk in nondomesticated zoo mammals belonging to 191 species 110148 individual demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny this research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals for instance species in the order carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer eg over 25 of clouded leopards bateared foxes and red wolves die of cancer while ungulates especially eventoed ungulates appear to face consistently low cancer riskscitation needed,0
during the enlightenment attitudes towards the mentally ill began to change it came to be viewed as a disorder that required compassionate treatment in 1758 english physician william battie wrote his treatise on madness on the management of mental disorder it was a critique aimed particularly at the bethlem royal hospital where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment battie argued for a tailored management of patients entailing cleanliness good food fresh air and distraction from friends and family he argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind,0
the most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna the phosphate group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information the most common nitrogenous bases are adenine cytosine guanine thymine and uracil the nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid adenine binds with thymine and uracil thymine binds only with adenine and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another adenine thymine and uracil contain two hydrogen bonds while hydrogen bonds formed between cytosine and guanine are three,0
linear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane for instance two numbers w and z in c displaystyle mathbb c  have a difference w  z and the line segments wz and 0w  z are of the same length and direction the segments are equipollent the fourdimensional system h displaystyle mathbb h  of quaternions was discovered by wr hamilton in 1843 the term vector was introduced as v  xi  yj  zk representing a point in space the quaternion difference p  q also produces a segment equipollent to pq other hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of a linear space with a basis,0
like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism some proteins have structural or mechanical functions such as actin and myosin in muscle and the cytoskeletons scaffolding proteins that maintain cell shape other proteins are important in cell signaling immune responses cell adhesion and the cell cycle in animals proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use,0
secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists these include both ambulatory care and inpatient services emergency departments intensive care medicine surgery services physical therapy labor and delivery endoscopy units diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services hospice centers etc some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting,0
the chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy and will not occur by themselves by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy enzymes act as catalyststhey allow a reaction to proceed more rapidlyand they also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction for example in response to changes in the cells environment or to signals from other cells,0
physical pain can be managed using pain medications as long as they do not put the patient at further risk for developing or increasing medical diagnoses such as heart problems or difficulty breathing patients at the end of life can exhibit many physical symptoms that can cause extreme pain such as dyspnea or difficulty breathing coughing xerostomia dry mouth nausea and vomiting constipation fever delirium and excessive oral and pharyngeal secretions death rattle radiation is commonly used with palliative intent to alleviate pain in patients with cancer as an effect from radiation may take days to weeks to occur patients dying a short time following their treatment are unlikely to receive benefit,0
although as a general rule dietary supplement labeling and marketing are not allowed to make disease prevention or treatment claims the us fda has for some foods and dietary supplements reviewed the science concluded that there is significant scientific agreement and published specifically worded allowed health claims an initial ruling allowing a health claim for calcium dietary supplements and osteoporosis was later amended to include calcium supplements with or without vitamin d effective january 1 2010 examples of allowed wording are shown below in order to qualify for the calcium health claim a dietary supplement must contain at least 20 of the reference dietary intake which for calcium means at least 260 mgserving,0
the term preventive medicine is related to public health the american board of preventive medicine separates three categories of preventive medicine aerospace health occupational health and public health and general preventative medicine jung boris and lushniak argue that preventive medicine should be considered the medical specialty for public health but note that the american college of preventive medicine and american board of preventive medicine do not prominently use the term public health 1 preventive medicine specialists are trained as clinicians and address complex health needs of a population such as by assessing the need for disease prevention programs using the best methods to implement them and assessing their effectiveness 1 3,0
a pathologist ronald s weinstein md coined the term telepathology in 1986 in an editorial in a medical journal weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services he and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology weinstein was also granted the first us patents for robotic telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks weinstein is known to many as the father of telepathology in norway eide and nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989 this is still in operation decades later a number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in north america europe and asia,0
pain physicians are often fellowshiptrained boardcertified anesthesiologists neurologists physiatrists emergency physicians or psychiatrists palliative care doctors are also specialists in pain management the american society of interventional pain physicians the american board of anesthesiology the american osteopathic board of anesthesiology recognized by the aoabos the american board of physical medicine and rehabilitation the american board of emergency medicine and the american board of psychiatry and neurology each provide certification for a subspecialty in pain management following fellowship training the fellowship training is recognized by the american board of medical specialties abms or the american osteopathic association bureau of osteopathic specialists aoabos as the field of pain medicine has grown rapidly many practitioners have entered the field some nonacgme boardcertified,0
biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own field of study as compared to many other engineering fields such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among alreadyestablished fields to being considered a field in itself much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development spanning a broad array of subfields see below prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to microimplants imaging technologies such as mri and ekgecg regenerative tissue growth and the development of pharmaceutical drugs including biopharmaceuticals,0
the cold war affected the research project for systems theory in ways that sorely disappointed many of the seminal theorists some began to recognize that theories defined in association with systems theory had deviated from the initial general systems theory view economist kenneth boulding an early researcher in systems theory had concerns over the manipulation of systems concepts boulding concluded from the effects of the cold war that abuses of power always prove consequential and that systems theory might address such issues 229233 since the end of the cold war a renewed interest in systems theory emerged combined with efforts to strengthen an ethical view on the subject,0
one mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with active transcription is biophysical in nature because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the dna backbone the acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage this removes the positive charge thus loosening the dna from the histone when this occurs complexes like swisnf and other transcriptional factors can bind to the dna and allow transcription to occur this is the cis model of the epigenetic function in other words changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the dna itself,0
in a study carried out on mice the ratio of firmicutes and lachnospiraceae was significantly elevated in animals treated with subtherapeutic doses of different antibiotics by analyzing the caloric content of faeces and the concentration of small chain fatty acids scfas in the gi tract it was concluded that the changes in the composition of microbiota lead to an increased capacity to extract calories from otherwise indigestible constituents and to an increased production of scfas these findings provide evidence that antibiotics perturb not only the composition of the gi microbiome but also its metabolic capabilities specifically with respect to scfas,0
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is a form of psychotherapy that aims to reduce symptoms of various mental health conditions primarily depression ptsd and anxiety disorders cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions such as thoughts beliefs and attitudes and their associated behaviors to improve emotional regulation and develop personal coping strategies that target solving current problems though it was originally designed as an approach to treat depression cbt is often prescribed for the evidenceinformed treatment of many mental health and other conditions including anxiety substance use disorders marital problems adhd and eating disorders cbt includes a number of cognitive or behavioral psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidencebased techniques and strategies,0
the leading edge of circadian biology research is translation of basic body clock mechanisms into clinical tools and this is especially relevant to the treatment of cardiovascular disease timing of medical treatment in coordination with the body clock chronotherapeutics may also benefit patients with hypertension high blood pressure by significantly increasing efficacy and reduce drug toxicity or adverse reactions 3 circadian pharmacology or drugs targeting the circadian clock mechanism have been shown experimentally in rodent models to significantly reduce the damage due to heart attacks and prevent heart failure importantly for rational translation of the most promising circadian medicine therapies to clinical practice it is imperative that we understand how it helps treat disease in both biological sexes,0
different fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity one way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of falsepositives claimed effects that are not correct to falsenegatives studies which fail to support a true effect in genetic epidemiology candidategene studies may produce over 100 falsepositive findings for each falsenegative by contrast genomewide association appear close to the reverse with only one false positive for every 100 or more falsenegatives this ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria by contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result,0
dietary supplements can be manufactured using intact sources or extracts from plants animals algae fungi or lichens including such examples as ginkgo biloba curcumin cranberry st johns wort ginseng resveratrol glucosamine and collagen products bearing promotional claims of health benefits are sold without requiring a prescription in pharmacies supermarkets specialist shops military commissaries buyers clubs direct selling organizations and the internet while most of these products have a long history of use in herbalism and various forms of traditional medicine concerns exist about their actual efficacy safety and consistency of quality canada has published a manufacturer and consumer guide describing quality licensing standards identities and common contaminants of natural products,0
this became the foundational crisis of mathematics it was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory roughly speaking each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have for example in peano arithmetic the natural numbers are defined by zero is a number each number has a unique successor each number but zero has a unique predecessor and some rules of reasoning this mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism as founded by david hilbert around 1910,0
in 2015 all un countries negotiated the paris agreement which aims to keep global warming well below 20 c and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 15 c the agreement replaced the kyoto protocol unlike kyoto no binding emission targets were set in the paris agreement instead a set of procedures was made binding countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years the paris agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported as of october 2021update 194 states and the european union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement,0
various interventions such as simplifying information and illustrations avoiding jargon using teachback methods and encouraging patients questions have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy the proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the us in the year 2010 who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 606 this number increased 1 from 2007 to 2010 the healthy people 2020 initiative of the united states department of health and human services hhs has included health literacy as a pressing new topic with objectives for improving it in the decade to come,0
a systematic review evaluated 45 studies that examined the relationship between physical activity and cancer survival rates according to the review there was consistent evidence from 27 observational studies that physical activity is associated with reduced allcause breast cancerspecific and colon cancerspecific mortality there is currently insufficient evidence regarding the association between physical activity and mortality for survivors of other cancers evidence suggests that exercise may positively affect the quality of life in cancer survivors including factors such as anxiety selfesteem and emotional wellbeing for people with cancer undergoing active treatment exercise may also have positive effects on healthrelated quality of life such as fatigue and physical functioning this is likely to be more pronounced with higher intensity exercise,0
the contemporary work of peter senge provides detailed discussion of the commonplace critique of educational systems grounded in conventional assumptions about learning including the problems with fragmented knowledge and lack of holistic learning from the machineage thinking that became a model of school separated from daily life in this way some systems theorists attempt to provide alternatives to and evolved ideation from orthodox theories which have grounds in classical assumptions including individuals such as max weber and mile durkheim in sociology and frederick winslow taylor in scientific management the theorists sought holistic methods by developing systems concepts that could integrate with different areas,0
rna vaccines and dna vaccines are examples of third generation vaccines in 2016 a dna vaccine for the zika virus began testing at the national institutes of health separately inovio pharmaceuticals and geneone life science began tests of a different dna vaccine against zika in miami manufacturing the vaccines in volume was unsolved as of 2016 clinical trials for dna vaccines to prevent hiv are underway mrna vaccines such as bnt162b2 were developed in the year 2020 with the help of operation warp speed and massively deployed to combat the covid19 pandemic in 2021 katalin karik and drew weissman received columbia universitys horwitz prize for their pioneering research in mrna vaccine technology,0
osha develops safety standards in the code of federal regulations and enforces those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by compliance officers enforcement resources are focused on highhazard industries worksites may apply to enter oshas voluntary protection program vpp a successful application leads to an onsite inspection if this is passed the site gains vpp status and osha no longer inspect it annually nor normally visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until vpp revalidation after threefive years vpp sites generally have injury and illness rates less than half the average for their industrycitation needed,0
considering that 360 million people across the world live with disabling hearing loss including 32 million children and nearly 180 million older adults and that chronic ear diseases such as chronic suppurative otitis media can lead to hearing loss and may cause lifethreatening complications the seventieth world health assembly on may 31 2017 signed the resolution wha7013 agenda item 158 urging member states to integrate strategies for ear and hearing care within the framework of their primary health care systems under the umbrella of universal health coverage a world report on hearing wrh was published in response to the resolution wha7013 to provide guidance for member states to integrate ear and hearing care into their national health plans,0
there is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers people with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment this may be due to the adoption of a glutenfree diet which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease however the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a glutenfree diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with crohns disease and ulcerative colitis due to chronic inflammation immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extraintestinal malignancies,0
krill oil is a source of omega3 fatty acids the effect of krill oil at a lower dose of epa  dha 628 was demonstrated to be similar to that of fish oil on blood lipid levels and markers of inflammation in healthy humans while not an endangered species krill are a mainstay of the diets of many oceanbased species including whales causing environmental and scientific concerns about their sustainability preliminary studies indicate that the dha and epa omega3 fatty acids found in krill oil are more bioavailable than in fish oil additionally krill oil contains astaxanthin a marinesource ketocarotenoid antioxidant that may act synergistically with epa and dha,0
cell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life that all living things are composed of one or more cells and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division most cells are very small with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope there are generally two types of cells eukaryotic cells which contain a nucleus and prokaryotic cells which do not prokaryotes are singlecelled organisms such as bacteria whereas eukaryotes can be singlecelled or multicellular in multicellular organisms every cell in the organisms body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg,0
the vegan society soon made clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose not only in diet in 1947 watson wrote the vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own from 1948 the vegans front page read advocating living without exploitation and in 1951 the society published its definition of veganism as the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals in 1956 its vicepresident leslie cross founded the plantmilk society and in 1965 as plantmilk ltd and later plamil foods it began production of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the western world,0
the atom is the basic unit of chemistry it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons together called nucleons while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus in a neutral atom the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons the nucleus is dense the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1836 times that of an electron yet the radius of an atom is about 10000 times that of its nucleus,0
complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age in many developing countries a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute according to the world health organizations 2005 world health report poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide after hivaids malaria and tuberculosis most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the developed world targets for improving maternal health include increasing and assisting the number of deliveries accompanied by skilled birth attendants 68 lowincome countries tracked by the who and unicefled collaboration countdown to 2015 are estimated to hold for 97 of worldwide maternal and child deaths,0
thus when von bertalanffy spoke of allgemeine systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new perspective a new way of doing science it was not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on general system theory to wit that it is a scientific theory of general systems to criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men von bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory which as we now know can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence he created a new paradigm for the development of theories,0
in some jurisdictions and among different faithbased organizations health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances including the sick other jurisdictions and nongovernmental organizations draw on the principles of humanism in defining their health policies asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined right to health in recent years the worldwide human rights organization amnesty international has focused on health as a human right addressing inadequate access to hiv drugs and womens sexual and reproductive rights including wide disparities in maternal mortality within and across countries such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal the lancet,0
donald watson cofounder of the vegan society asked why he was an ethical vegan replied if an openminded honest person pursues a course long enough and listens to all the criticisms and in ones own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea sooner or later ones resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded of bloodsports he has said that to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs and that vivisection and animal experimentation is probably the cruelest of all mans attack on the rest of creation he has also said vegetarianism whilst being a necessary steppingstone between meat eating and veganism is only a stepping stone,0
before the industrial revolution naturallyoccurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 c warmer than it would have been in their absence human activity since the industrial revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2022 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 50 and 164 respectively since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years,0
finally tertiary prevention attempts to reduce the damage caused by symptomatic disease by focusing on mental physical and social rehabilitation unlike secondary prevention which aims to prevent disability the objective of tertiary prevention is to maximize the remaining capabilities and functions of an already disabled patient goals of tertiary prevention include preventing pain and damage halting progression and complications from disease and restoring the health and functions of the individuals affected by disease for syphilitic patients rehabilitation includes measures to prevent complete disability from the disease such as implementing workplace adjustments for the blind and paralyzed or providing counseling to restore normal daily functions to the greatest extent possible,0
for example cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals every year nearly half a million new cases of multidrugresistant tuberculosis mdrtb are estimated to occur worldwide china and india have the highest rate of mdrtb who reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with mdrtb with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics extensively drugresistant tuberculosis xdrtb was first identified in africa in 2006 and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries during 2021 there were estimated to be around 25000 cases xdrtb worldwide,0
modern humans often find themselves desynchronized from their internal circadian clock due to the requirements of work especially night shifts longdistance travel and the influence of universal indoor lighting even if they have sleep debt or feel sleepy people can have difficulty staying asleep at the peak of their circadian cycle conversely they can have difficulty waking up in the trough of the cycle a healthy young adult entrained to the sun will during most of the year fall asleep a few hours after sunset experience body temperature minimum at 6 am and wake up a few hours after sunrise,0
the impact of a stressful environment has also been highlighted by different models mental health has often been understood from the lens of the vulnerabilitystress model in that context stressful situations may contribute to a preexisting vulnerability to negative mental health outcomes being realized on the other hand the differential susceptibility hypothesis suggests that mental health outcomes are better explained by an increased sensitivity to the environment than by vulnerability for example it was found that children scoring higher on observerrated environmental sensitivity often derive more harm from lowquality parenting but also more benefits from highquality parenting than those children scoring lower on that measure,0
between 2018 and 2023 the fda issued 29 warning letters to american manufacturers of dietary supplements for making false claims of antidisease effects from using products containing curcumin in each letter the fda stated that the supplement product was not an approved new drug because the product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the advertised uses that new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from fda and that the fda approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective,0
the german psychologist hermann ebbinghaus a researcher at the university of berlin was a 19thcentury contributor to the field he pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting in the early 20th century wolfgang kohler max wertheimer and kurt koffka cofounded the school of gestalt psychology of fritz perls the approach of gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes rather than reducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements as in structuralism the gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important and differs from the sum of its partscitation needed,0
in the theory of inflation the rapid initial expansion of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the inflaton the exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory indeed there have been a number of attempts to identify an inflaton within the spectrum of particles described by string theory and to study inflation using string theory while these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages,0
many countries are dealing with aging populations so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full independent lives in the comfort of their own homes there is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in daytoday activities at home such as transportation to and from doctors appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and wellbeing although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts this state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ict information and communication technology for home care,0
a basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in classical greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by aristotle stating that fire air earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination greek atomism dates back to 440 bc arising in works by philosophers such as democritus and epicurus in 50 bce the roman philosopher lucretius expanded upon the theory in his poem de rerum natura on the nature of things unlike modern concepts of science greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments,0
cbt looks at the habit of smoking cigarettes as a learned behavior which later evolves into a coping strategy to handle daily stressors since smoking is often easily accessible and quickly allows the user to feel good it can take precedence over other coping strategies and eventually work its way into everyday life during nonstressful events as well cbt aims to target the function of the behavior as it can vary between individuals and works to inject other coping mechanisms in place of smoking cbt also aims to support individuals with strong cravings which are a major reported reason for relapse during treatment,0
a xenograft is a transplant of organs or tissue from one species to another an example is porcine heart valve transplant which is quite common and successful another example is attempted piscineprimate fish to nonhuman primate transplant of pancreatic islets the latter research study was intended to pave the way for potential human use if successful however xenotransplantation is often an extremely dangerous type of transplant because of the increased risk of nonfunctional compatibility rejection and disease carried in the tissue in the opposite direction attempts are being made to devise a way to transplant human fetal hearts and kidneys into animals for future transplantation into human patients to address the shortage of donor organs,0
in other european countries the charit a hospital founded in 1710 in berlin established a separate pediatric pavilion in 1830 followed by similar institutions at saint petersburg in 1834 and at vienna and breslau now wrocaw both in 1837 in 1852 britains first pediatric hospital the hospital for sick children great ormond street was founded by charles west the first childrens hospital in scotland opened in 1860 in edinburgh in the us the first similar institutions were the childrens hospital of philadelphia which opened in 1855 and then boston childrens hospital 1869 subspecialties in pediatrics were created at the harriet lane home at johns hopkins by edwards a park,0
during the renaissance two more areas appeared mathematical notation led to algebra which roughly speaking consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas calculus consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus is the study of continuous functions which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities as represented by variables this division into four main areasarithmetic geometry algebra and calculusendured until the end of the 19th century areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians but now are considered as belonging to physics the subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century,0
nearly all organisms have some kind of immune system bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against viral infections other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient plants and animals and remain in their modern descendants these mechanisms include phagocytosis antimicrobial peptides called defensins and the complement system jawed vertebrates including humans have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently adaptive or acquired immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination,0
in a hospital setting sample processing will usually start with a set of samples arriving with a test request either on a form or electronically via the laboratory information system lis inpatient specimens will already be labeled with patient and testing information provided by the lis entry of test requests onto the lis system involves typing or scanning where barcodes are used in the laboratory number and entering the patient identification as well as any tests requested this allows laboratory analyzers computers and staff to recognize what tests are pending and also gives a location such as a hospital department doctor or other customer for results reporting,0
however after the 1966 international covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present leading to the first ever world food conference that was held in 1974 in rome italy the universal declaration on the eradication of hunger and malnutrition was a un resolution adopted november 16 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 world food conference this nonlegally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger,0
the central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism fitness is measured by an organisms ability to survive and reproduce which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation however fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organisms genes for example if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness,0
zoonotic disease emergence is demonstrably linked to the consumption of wildlife meat exacerbated by human encroachment into natural habitats and amplified by the unsanitary conditions of wildlife markets these markets where diverse species converge facilitate the mixing and transmission of pathogens including those responsible for outbreaks of hiv1 ebola and mpox and potentially even the covid19 pandemic notably small mammals often harbor a vast array of zoonotic bacteria and viruses yet endemic bacterial transmission among wildlife remains largely unexplored therefore accurately determining the pathogenic landscape of traded wildlife is crucial for guiding effective measures to combat zoonotic diseases and documenting the societal and environmental costs associated with this practice,0
in carbohydrate anabolism simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch the generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate lactate glycerol glycerate 3phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose6phosphate through a series of intermediates many of which are shared with glycolysis however this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse as several steps are catalyzed by nonglycolytic enzymes this is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle,0
in alignment with the lcogs call for action the world health assembly adopted the resolution wha6815 in 2015 that stated strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anesthesia as a component of universal health coverage this not only mandated the who to prioritize strengthening the surgical and anesthesia care globally but also led to governments of the member states recognizing the urgent need for increasing capacity in surgery and anesthesia additionally the third edition of disease control priorities dcp3 published in 2015 by the world bank declared surgery as essential and featured an entire volume dedicated to building surgical capacity,0
the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection especially during the black death in the 14th and 15th centuries of what may be called the traditional authority approach to science and medicine this was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so then that was the way it was and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly which was paralleled by a similar shift in european society in general  see copernicuss rejection of ptolemys theories on astronomy physicians like vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past the main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were materia medica and pharmacopoeia,0
the scientific branch that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level is called cytopathology cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments in contrast to the pathology branch of histopathology which studies whole tissues cytopathology is commonly used to investigate diseases involving a wide range of body sites often to aid in the diagnosis of cancer but also in the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions for example a common application of cytopathology is the pap smear a screening test used to detect cervical cancer and precancerous cervical lesions that may lead to cervical cancer,0
classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k1 subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy,0
naming groups of organisms in a way that is clear and widely agreed is important as some disputes in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones for example it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higherlevel grouping eg genus or family or order this is important since the linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed,0
besides material characterization the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms thus ingot casting foundry methods blast furnace extraction and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer often the presence absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced for example steels are classified based on 110 and 1100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain thus the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced,0
lifestyle diseases can be defined as the diseases linked to the manner in which a person lives their life these diseases are noncommunicable and can be caused by lack of physical activity unhealthy eating alcohol substance use disorders and smoking tobacco which can lead to heart disease stroke obesity type ii diabetes and lung cancer the diseases that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer include alzheimers disease arthritis atherosclerosis asthma cancer chronic liver disease or cirrhosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease colitis irritable bowel syndrome type 2 diabetes heart disease hypertension metabolic syndrome chronic kidney failure osteoporosis pcod stroke depression obesity and vascular dementia,0
undernutrition most commonly results from a lack of access to highquality nutritious food the household income is a socioeconomic variable that influences the access to nutritious food and the probability of under and overnutrition in a community in the study by ghattas et al 2020 the probability of overnutrition is significantly higher in higherincome families than in disadvantaged families high food prices is a major factor preventing low income households from getting nutritious food for example khan and kraemer 2009 found that in bangladesh low socioeconomic status was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibited purchase of nutritious foods like milk meat poultry and fruits,0
leadership that includes all members of staff and patients in a healthcare setting is referred to as collective leadership the idea is that all people involved in healthcare including those at the receiving end such as patients and caregiversfamilies share responsibility for decision making performance of the healthcare system and successes collective leadership is based on the concept that all stakeholders share viewpoints and knowledge in order to keep up with rapid technological changes patientcentered outcomes and the increasing need for specialization in healthcare the effectiveness of this approach is still being understood and there is no strong evidence to suggest that this approach improves clinical performance mortality of inpatients or other outcomes such as staff absences,0
those in the field of occupational safety and health come from a wide range of disciplines and professions including medicine occupational medicine epidemiology physiotherapy and rehabilitation psychology human factors and ergonomics and many others professionals advise on a broad range of occupational safety and health matters these include how to avoid particular preexisting conditions causing a problem in the occupation correct posture frequency of rest breaks preventive actions that can be undertaken and so forth the quality of occupational safety is characterized by 1 the indicators reflecting the level of industrial injuries 2 the average number of days of incapacity for work per employer 3 employees satisfaction with their work conditions and 4 employees motivation to work safely,0
access to surgical care is increasingly recognized as an integral aspect of healthcare and therefore is evolving into a normative derivation of human right to health the icescr article 121 and 122 define the human right to health as the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health in the august 2000 the un committee on economic social and cultural rights cescr interpreted this to mean right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities goods services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable health surgical care can be thereby viewed as a positive right  an entitlement to protective healthcare,0
the quality of sleep may be evaluated from an objective and a subjective point of view objective sleep quality refers to how difficult it is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state and how many times they wake up during a single night poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep a study by a harvey et al 2002 found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems,0
medications can be used to prevent cancer in a few circumstances in the general population nsaids reduce the risk of colorectal cancer however due to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects they cause overall harm when used for prevention aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about 7 cox2 inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis however it is associated with the same adverse effects as nsaids daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer in highrisk women the benefit versus harm for 5alphareductase inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear,0
cosmology from ancient greek  cosmos the universe the world and  logia study of is a branch of physics and metaphysics dealing with the nature of the universe the cosmos the term cosmology was first used in english in 1656 in thomas blounts glossographia and in 1731 taken up in latin by german philosopher christian wolff in cosmologia generalis religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology in the science of astronomy cosmology is concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe,0
when waddington coined the term the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known he used it instead as a conceptual model of how genetic components might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype he used the phrase epigenetic landscape as a metaphor for biological development waddington held that cell fates were established during development in a process he called canalisation much as a marble rolls down to the point of lowest local elevation waddington suggested visualising increasing irreversibility of cell type differentiation as ridges rising between the valleys where the marbles analogous to cells are travelling,0
the wave model can be used to make predictions about how an optical system will behave without requiring an explanation of what is waving in what medium until the middle of the 19th century most physicists believed in an ethereal medium in which the light disturbance propagated the existence of electromagnetic waves was predicted in 1865 by maxwells equations these waves propagate at the speed of light and have varying electric and magnetic fields which are orthogonal to one another and also to the direction of propagation of the waves light waves are now generally treated as electromagnetic waves except when quantum mechanical effects have to be considered,0
in 1986 a meeting at the institute of medicine defined gene therapy as the addition or replacement of a gene in a targeted cell type in the same year the fda announced that it had jurisdiction over approving gene therapy without defining the term the fda added a very broad definition in 1993 of any treatment that would modify or manipulate the expression of genetic material or to alter the biological properties of living cells in 2018 this was narrowed to products that mediate their effects by transcription or translation of transferred genetic material or by specifically altering host human genetic sequences,0
the study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membranebound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear a useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a reporter such as green fluorescent protein gfp the fused proteins position within the cell can then be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy,0
a 2022 study found that for highincome nations alone 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide could be removed from the air by the end of the century through a shift to plantbased diets and rewilding of farmlands the researchers coined the term double climate dividend to describe the effect that rewilding after a diet shift can have but they note we dont have to be purist about this even just cutting animal intake would be helpful if half of the public in richer regions cut half the animal products in their diets youre still talking about a massive opportunity in environmental outcomes and public health,0
the science of epidemiology was founded by john snows identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in london snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory by talking to local residents with the help of reverend henry whitehead he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on broad street now broadwick street although snows chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the broad street pump did not conclusively prove its danger his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to close the well pump by removing its handle,0
diabetes also known as diabetes mellitus is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulins effects classic symptoms include polydipsia excessive thirst polyuria excessive urination polyphagia excessive hunger weight loss and blurred vision if left untreated the disease can lead to various health complications including disorders of the cardiovascular system eye kidney and nerves diabetes accounts for approximately 42 million deaths every year with an estimated 15 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes,0
chronic kidney disease is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions such as diabetes avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys nephrotoxins like radiologic contrast and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs antihypertensives diet and weight modification and planning for endstage kidney failure impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body an erythropoetin stimulating agent esa may be required to ensure adequate production of red blood cells activated vitamin d supplements and phosphate binders may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on bone metabolism and blood volume and electrolyte disturbance may need correction diuretics such as furosemide may be used to correct fluid overload and alkalis such as sodium bicarbonate can be used to treat metabolic acidosis,0
as a discipline psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a soft science philosopher of science thomas kuhns 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a preparadigm state lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in mature hard sciences such as chemistry and physics because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as selfreports in surveys and questionnaires critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science skeptics have suggested that personality thinking and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective selfreports which may be problematic experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities,0
as individuals age they experience declines in some aspects of cognitive functioning including thinking speed multitasking and remembering information engaging in healthful dietary practices has been shown to reduce some of the cognitive declines that come with aging for example diets high in antioxidants olive oil and nuts have been shown to reduce various aspects of cognitive decline low levels of protein can also cause mild cognitive impairment in contrast having high levels of certain macronutrients can also lead to mild cognitive decline for example high levels of protein and fat intake can cause issues as one begins to age however having adequate amounts of macronutrient intake can lead to feelings of satisfaction when it comes to focus and concentration,0
only a few human studies have been done to determine the adverse effects of resveratrol all of them preliminary with small participant numbers adverse effects resulted mainly from longterm use weeks or longer and daily doses of 1000 mg or higher causing nausea stomach pain flatulence and diarrhea a review of 136 patients in seven studies who were given more than 500 mg for a month showed 25 cases of diarrhea 8 cases of abdominal pain 7 cases of nausea and 5 cases of flatulence a 2018 review of resveratrol effects on blood pressure found that some people had increased frequency of bowel movements and loose stools,0
in an infectious disease the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms the latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person which may precede follow or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase called viral latency in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state for example varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase after recovery from chickenpox the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years and later cause herpes zoster shingles,0
hrv data from both polyplethysmographs and electrocardiograms are analyzed via mathematical transformations such as the commonlyused fast fourier transform fft the fft splits the hrv data into a power spectrum revealing the waveforms constituent frequencies among those constituent frequencies highfrequency hf and lowfrequency lf components are defined as above and below 15 hz respectively as a rule of thumb the lf component of hrv represents sympathetic activity and the hf component represents parasympathetic activity the two main components are often represented as a lfhf ratio and used to express sympathovagal balance some researchers consider a third mediumfrequency mf component from 08 hz to 15 hz which has been shown to increase in power during times of appreciation,0
ubash3b encodes a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity which has been previously linked to advanced neoplasia snp rs7115089 was identified as influencing dna methylation and expression of this locus as well as and body mass index bmi in fact snp rs7115089 is strongly associated with bmi and with genetic variants linked to other cardiovascular and metabolic traits in gwass new studies suggesting ubash3b as a potential mediator of adiposity and cardiometabolic disease in addition animal models demonstrated that ubash3b expression is an indicator of caloric restriction that may drive programmed susceptibility to obesity and it is associated with other measures of adiposity in human peripherical blood,0
speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short bursts of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis where species remain relatively unchanged in this theory speciation and rapid evolution are linked with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations as a result the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils,0
data from who and the world bank indicate that scaling up infrastructure to enable access to surgical care in regions where it is currently limited or is nonexistent is a lowcost measure relative to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by lack of surgical treatment in fact a systematic review found that the costeffectiveness ratio  dollars spent per dalys averted  for surgical interventions is on par or exceeds those of major public health interventions such as oral rehydration therapy breastfeeding promotion and even hivaids antiretroviral therapy this finding challenged the common misconception that surgical care is financially prohibitive endeavor not worth pursuing in lmics,0
today the pure science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to distinguish it from applied optical sciences which are referred to as optical engineering prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering photonics and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design fabrication and testing of optical components and image processing some of these fields overlap with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms that mean slightly different things in different parts of the world and in different areas of industry a professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the last several decades due to advances in laser technology,0
burning fuels like coal or kerosene inside homes can cause dangerous chemicals to be released into the air dampness and mold in houses can cause diseases but few studies have been performed on mold in schools and workplaces environmental tobacco smoke is considered to be a leading contributor to indoor air pollution since exposure to second and thirdhand smoke is a common risk factor tobacco smoke contains over 60 carcinogens where 18 are known human carcinogens exposure to these chemicals can lead to exacerbation of asthma the development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiopulmonary diseases and an increase in the likelihood of cancer development,0
computerised systems involved in patient care have led to a number of changes such changes have led to improvements in electronic health records which are now capable of sharing medical information among multiple health care stakeholders zahabi kaber  swangnetr 2015 thereby supporting the flow of patient information through various modalities of care one opportunity for electronic health records ehr to be even more effectively used is to utilize natural language processing for searching and analyzing notes and text that would otherwise be inaccessible for review these can be further developed through ongoing collaboration between software developers and endusers of natural language processing tools within the electronic health ehrs,0
cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate atp and then release waste products the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions which break large molecules into smaller ones releasing energy respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity the overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps some of which are redox reactions although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow controlled release of energy from the series of reactions,0
other pioneers include danish physician peter anton schleisner who in 1849 related his work on the prevention of the epidemic of neonatal tetanus on the vestmanna islands in iceland another important pioneer was hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure his findings were published in 1850 but his work was illreceived by his colleagues who discontinued the procedure disinfection did not become widely practiced until british surgeon joseph lister aided by his college chemist thomas anderson was able to discover antiseptics in 1865 based on the earlier work of louis pasteur,0
crosscontamination of food occurs when allergens are unintentionally transferred from one food item to another often through shared cooking equipment not properly cleaned surfaces or utensils this can lead to severe allergic reactions in individuals with food allergies even if the allergen is present in trace amounts to mitigate risks food labeling regulations such as in the united states require manufacturers to clearly indicate potential allergens on packaging often with statements like may contain or processed in a facility that handles proper handling practices such as thorough cleaning and separation of allergenfree foods are essential in both commercial and home kitchens to prevent crosscontact and ensure safety for those with food allergies,0
some public health organisations advocate a plantbased diet due to its low ecological footprint these include the swedish food agency in its dietary guideline and a group of lancet researchers who propose a planetary health diet vegan climate activist greta thunberg also called for more plantbased food production and consumption worldwide a 2022 report by the stockholm environment institute and the council on energy environment and water included protecting animal welfare and adopting plant based diets on a list of recommendations to help mitigate the ecological and social crises bringing the world to a boiling point denmark and south korea announced plantbased action plans in 2023 plantbased protein is gaining popularity as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to animalbased sources,0
outpatient treatment involves periodic visits to a psychiatrist for consultation in his or her office or at a communitybased outpatient clinic during initial appointments a psychiatrist generally conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient followup appointments then focus on making medication adjustments reviewing potential medication interactions considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patients mental and emotional functioning and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms the frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely from once a week to twice a year depending on the type severity and stability of each persons condition and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best,0
global humancaused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions 75 was co2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminum and fertilizer methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer,0
organ transplantation in china has taken place since the 1960s and china has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world peaking at over 13000 transplants a year by 2004 organ donation however is against chinese tradition and culture and involuntary organ donation is illegal under chinese law chinas transplant programme attracted the attention of international news media in the 1990s due to ethical concerns about the organs and tissue removed from the corpses of executed criminals being commercially traded in 2006 it became clear that about 41500 organs had been sourced from falun gong practitioners in china since 2000,0
the neutrons and protons in the atomic nuclei are baryons  the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark and the proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark a baryon is composed of three quarks and a meson is composed of two quarks one normal one anti baryons and mesons are collectively called hadrons quarks inside hadrons are governed by the strong interaction thus are subjected to quantum chromodynamics color charges the bounded quarks must have their color charge to be neutral or white for analogy with mixing the primary colors more exotic hadrons can have other types arrangement or number of quarks tetraquark pentaquark,0
at the end of the 19th century the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics the 2020 mathematics subject classification contains no less than sixtythree firstlevel areas some of these areas correspond to the older division as is true regarding number theory the modern name for higher arithmetic and geometry several other firstlevel areas have geometry in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry algebra and calculus do not appear as firstlevel areas but are respectively split into several firstlevel areas other firstlevel areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics such as mathematical logic and foundations,0
the vegan society has written by extension veganism promotes the development and use of animalfree alternatives for the benefit of humans many ethical vegans and vegan organizations cite the poor working conditions of slaughterhouse workers as a reason to reject animal products the first vegan activist donald watson has asked if these butchers and vivisectors werent there could we perform the acts that they are doing and if we couldnt we have no right to expect them to do it on our behalf full stop that simply compounds the issue it means that were not just exploiting animals were exploiting human beings,0
allergic diseases are strongly familial identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70 of the time the same allergy occurs about 40 of the time in nonidentical twins allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children and those childrens allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of nonallergic parents some allergies however are not consistent along genealogies parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system but the specific allergen is not,0
nonessential amino acids are produced in the body the pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of ketoglutarate to glutamate a transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids at this step the chirality of the amino acid is established alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate respectively glutamine is synthesized from nh4 and glutamate and asparagine is synthesized similarly proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate serine formed from 3phosphoglycerate which comes from glycolysis is the precursor of glycine and cysteine tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine which is an essential amino acid,0
given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved,0
for developing countries telemedicine and ehealth can be the only means of healthcare provision in remote areas for example the difficult financial situation in many african states and lack of trained health professionals has meant that the majority of the people in subsaharan africa are badly disadvantaged in medical care and in remote areas with low population density direct healthcare provision is often very poor however provision of telemedicine and ehealth from urban centers or from other countries is hampered by the lack of communications infrastructure with no landline phone or broadband internet connection little or no mobile connectivity and often not even a reliable electricity supply,0
nonhomologous end joining nhej repair of a doublestrand break can cause a small number of demethylations of preexisting cytosine dna methylations downstream of the repaired doublestrand break further work by allen et al showed that nhej of a dna doublestrand break in a cell could give rise to some progeny cells having repressed expression of the gene harboring the initial doublestrand break and some progeny having high expression of that gene due to epigenetic alterations associated with nhej repair the frequency of epigenetic alterations causing repression of a gene after an nhej repair of a dna doublestrand break in that gene may be about 09,0
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by tienne serres in 1839 to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de brau various shortlived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the socit ethnologique de paris the first to use the term ethnology was formed in 1839 and focused on methodically studying human races after the death of its founder william frdric edwards in 1842 it gradually declined in activity until it eventually dissolved in 1862,0
the field of genetics arose from attempts to understand the set of rules underlying reproduction and heredity and the nature of the hypothetical units of heredity known as genes gregor mendel pioneered this work in 1866 when he first described the laws of inheritance he observed in his studies of mating crosses in pea plants one such law of genetic inheritance is the law of segregation which states that diploid individuals with two alleles for a particular gene will pass one of these alleles to their offspring because of his critical work the study of genetic inheritance is commonly referred to as mendelian genetics,0
the oral route is generally the most convenient and costs the least however some drugs can cause gastrointestinal tract irritation for drugs that come in delayed release or timerelease formulations breaking the tablets or capsules can lead to more rapid delivery of the drug than intended the oral route is limited to formulations containing small molecules only while biopharmaceuticals usually proteins would be digested in the stomach and thereby become ineffective biopharmaceuticals have to be given by injection or infusion however recent research found various ways to improve oral bioavailability of these drugs in particular permeation enhancers ionic liquids lipidbased nanocarriers enzyme inhibitors and microneedles have shown potential,0
the national institutes of health nih is the agency that is responsible for management of the lions share of federal funding of biomedical research it funds over 280 areas directly related to health over the past century there were two notable periods of nih support from 1995 to 1996 funding increased from 8877 billion to 9366 billion years which represented the start of what is considered the doubling period of rapid nih support the second notable period started in 1997 and ended in 2010 a period where the nih moved to organize research spending for engagement with the scientific community,0
the organisms that constitute the microbial world are characterized as either prokaryotes or eukaryotes eukaryotic microorganisms possess membranebound organelles and include fungi and protists whereas prokaryotic organisms are conventionally classified as lacking membranebound organelles and include bacteria and archaea microbiologists traditionally relied on culture staining and microscopy for the isolation and identification of microorganisms however less than 1 of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means with the emergence of biotechnology microbiologists currently rely on molecular biology tools such as dna sequencebased identification for example the 16s rrna gene sequence used for bacterial identification,0
in the early 20th century criticism from dissenters downplayed the effects of global warming at this time few researchers were studying the dangers of fossil fuels after a 13 degrees celsius temperature anomaly was found in the atlantic ocean in the 1940s however scientists renewed their studies of gaseous heat trapping from the greenhouse effect although only carbon dioxide and water vapor were known to be greenhouse gases then nuclear development following the second world war allowed environmental scientists to intensively study the effects of carbon and make advancements in the field further knowledge from archaeological evidence brought to light the changes in climate over time particularly ice core sampling,0
living organisms must obey the laws of thermodynamics which describe the transfer of heat and work the second law of thermodynamics states that in any isolated system the amount of entropy disorder cannot decrease although living organisms amazing complexity appears to contradict this law life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings living systems are not in equilibrium but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments the metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the nonspontaneous processes of anabolism in thermodynamic terms metabolism maintains order by creating disorder,0
some scholars go as far as to claim that neither insulin resistance nor obesity really are metabolic disorders per se but simply adaptive responses to sustained caloric surplus intended to protect bodily organs from lipotoxicity unsafe levels of lipids in the bloodstream and tissues obesity should therefore not be regarded as a pathology or disease but rather as the normal physiologic response to sustained caloric surplus as a consequence of the high level of lipid accumulation in insulin target tissues including skeletal muscle and liver it has been suggested that exclusion of glucose from lipidladen cells is a compensatory defense against further accumulation of lipogenic substrate,0
structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science the very definition of the field holds that it is concerned with the investigation of the relationships that exist between the structures and properties of materials materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale all the way up to the macro scale characterization is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material this involves methods such as diffraction with xrays electrons or neutrons and various forms of spectroscopy and chemical analysis such as raman spectroscopy energydispersive spectroscopy chromatography thermal analysis electron microscope analysis etc,0
ediacara biota appear during the ediacaran period while vertebrates along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the cambrian explosion during the permian period synapsids including the ancestors of mammals dominated the land but most of this group became extinct in the permiantriassic extinction event 252 million years ago during the recovery from this catastrophe archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates one archosaur group the dinosaurs dominated the jurassic and cretaceous periods after the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the nonavian dinosaurs mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify,0
in states of insulin resistance beta cells in the pancreas increase their production of insulin this causes high blood insulin hyperinsulinemia to compensate for the high blood glucose during this compensated phase of insulin resistance beta cell function is upregulated insulin levels are higher and blood glucose levels are still maintained if compensatory insulin secretion fails then either fasting impaired fasting glucose or postprandial impaired glucose tolerance glucose concentrations increase eventually type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose levels become higher as the resistance increases and compensatory insulin secretion fails the inability of the cells to produce sufficient insulin in a condition of hyperglycemia is what characterizes the transition from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes,0
disease can arise if the hosts protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes for example clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts for example less than 5 of individuals infected with polio develop disease on the other hand some infectious agents are highly virulent the prion causing mad cow disease and creutzfeldtjakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected,0
the benefits of recommending a lowsalt diet in people with high or normal blood pressure are not clear in those with heart failure after one study was left out the rest of the trials show a trend to benefit another review of dietary salt concluded that there is strong evidence that high dietary salt intake increases blood pressure and worsens hypertension and that it increases the number of cardiovascular disease events both as a result of the increased blood pressure and probably through other mechanisms moderate evidence was found that high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality and some evidence was found for an increase in overall mortality strokes and left ventricular hypertrophy,0
the prevalence of certain food allergies is suggested to depend partly on the geographical area and country for instance allergy to buckwheat flour used for soba noodles is more common in japan than peanuts tree nuts or foods made from soy beans also shellfish allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and adolescents particularly in east asian countries like hong kong taiwan singapore and thailand individuals in east asia have further developed an allergy to rice which forms a large part of their diet another example is that out of nine european countries egg allergy was foundby whom to be most prevalent in the uk and least prevalent in greececitation needed,0
when the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body endstage kidney failure is said to have occurred without renal replacement therapy death from kidney failure will eventually result dialysis is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life renal transplantation replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an organ donor and inducing immunologic tolerance of that organ with immunosuppression at present renal transplantation is the most effective treatment for endstage kidney failure although its worldwide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs generally speaking kidneys from living donors are better than those from deceased donors as they last longer,0
there are several tests which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test ones health literacy some of these tests include the medical term recognition test meter which was developed in the united states 2 minute administration time for the clinical setting the meter includes many words from the rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine realm test the short assessment of health literacy in spanish and english populations sahlse uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a persons comprehension the chctest measures critical health competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a persons understanding of medical concepts literature searching basic statistics and design of experiments and samples,0
there is a relationship between light primary production and ecological energy budgets sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planets ecosystems light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths radiant energy from the sun generates heat provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life and also acts as a catalyst for genetic mutation plants algae and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of h2s are autotrophs autotrophsresponsible for primary productionassimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds,0
human diet has changed rapidly in recent centuries resulting in a reported increased diet of omega6 in comparison to omega3 the rapid evolution of human diet away from a 11 omega3 and omega6 ratio such as during the neolithic agricultural revolution has presumably been too fast for humans to have adapted to biological profiles adept at balancing omega3 and omega6 ratios of 11 this is commonly believed to be the reason why modern diets are correlated with many inflammatory disorders while omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans the level of omega6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and therefore the ratio does not matter,0
"formerly the name carbohydrate was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula cm h2on following this definition some chemists considered formaldehyde ch2o to be the simplest carbohydrate while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula for example while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this for example carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as nacetyl eg chitin sulfate eg glycosaminoglycans carboxylic acid and deoxy modifications e.g., fucose and sialic acid).",0
in addition to its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity the adscft correspondence has been applied to a variety of problems in quantum field theory one physical system that has been studied using the adscft correspondence is the quarkgluon plasma an exotic state of matter produced in particle accelerators this state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy ions such as gold or lead nuclei are collided at high energies such collisions cause the quarks that make up atomic nuclei to deconfine at temperatures of approximately two trillion kelvin conditions similar to those present at around 1011 seconds after the big bang,0
ot services focused on mental health can be provided to persons groups and populations across the lifespan and experiencing varying levels of mental health performance for example occupational therapy practitioners provide mental health services in school systems military environments hospitals outpatient clinics and inpatient mental health rehabilitation settings interventions or support can be provided directly through specific treatment interventions or indirectly by providing consultation to businesses schools or other larger groups to incorporate mental health strategies on a programmatic level even people who are mentally healthy can benefit from the health promotion and additional prevention strategies to reduce the impact of difficult situations,0
scientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein which comes from maize corn but recovered if they were fed casein from cows milk this led william cumming rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine through manipulation of rodent diets rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats lysine tryptophan histidine phenylalanine leucine isoleucine methionine valine and arginine in addition to threonine roses later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings with histidine also being essential for infants longerterm studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans,0
while more information about childhood diseases became available there was little evidence that children received the same kind of medical care that adults did it was during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that medical experts started offering specialized care for children the swedish physician nils rosn von rosenstein 17061773 is considered to be the founder of modern pediatrics as a medical specialty while his work the diseases of children and their remedies 1764 is considered to be the first modern textbook on the subject however it was not until the nineteenth century that medical professionals acknowledged pediatrics as a separate field of medicine the first pediatricspecific publications appeared between the 1790s and the 1920s,0
invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about 95 of the animal species by definition none of these creatures has a backbone the cells of singlecell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia food may be gathered by phagocytosis energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular colonies,0
plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere by approximately 350 million years ago the end of the devonian period photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17 which allowed combustion to occur fire releases co2 and converts fuel into ash and tar fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression while the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time charles cooper brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s,0
a concern is the case of medications which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe and may also contain animal ingredients such as lactose gelatine or stearates there may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable less effective or have more adverse side effects experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines food additives cosmetics household products workplace chemicals and many other substances vegans may avoid certain vaccines such as the flu vaccine which is commonly produced in chicken eggs an effective alternative flublok is widely available in the united states,0
ageism is defined as the process of systemic discrimination against the elderly as digital health becomes more prevalent in our society those who lack strong digital skills and the technical knowhow needed to navigate these platforms will be put at a disadvantage this doesnt just apply to current seniors new digital technologies become popularized every year rendering older technology obsolete this means that this digital divide will always be present unless health companies actively work to try to minimize this gap not to mention seniors are more prone to chronic health issues meaning that they are one of the groups that has the greatest need for a digital health platform they represent an untapped user group,0
there are two types of photoreceptor cells rods and cones which are sensitive to different aspects of light rod cells are sensitive to the intensity of light over a wide frequency range thus are responsible for blackandwhite vision rod cells are not present on the fovea the area of the retina responsible for central vision and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light there are however twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area because of their wider distribution rods are responsible for peripheral vision,0
the major goal of physical medicine and rehabilitation treatment is to help a person reach optimal functionality within the limitations placed upon them by a disabling impairment or disease process for which there is no known cure the emphasis is not on the full restoration to the premorbid level of function but rather the optimization of the quality of life for those not able to achieve full restoration a team approach to chronic conditions is emphasized to coordinate care of patients comprehensive rehabilitation is provided by specialists in this field who act as facilitators team leaders and medical experts for rehabilitationcitation needed,0
food allergies have become increasingly prevalent in industrializedwesternized nations over the last 23 decades an estimated 15 million people currently have food allergies in the united states in 1997 04 children in the united states were reported to have peanut allergy yet this number markedly rose to 14 in 2008 in australia hospital admission rates for foodinduced anaphylaxis increased by an average of 132 from 19942005 one possible explanation for the rise in food allergy is the old friends hypothesis which suggests that nondiseasecausing organisms such as helminths could protect against allergy therefore reduced exposure to these organisms particularly in developed countries could have contributed towards the increasecitation needed,0
one of the first experiments providing evidence for neuroplasticity was conducted in 1793 by italian anatomist michele vicenzo malacarne who described experiments in which he paired animals trained one of the pair extensively for years and then dissected both malacarne discovered that the cerebellums of the trained animals were substantially larger than the cerebellum of the untrained animals however while these findings were significant they were eventually forgotten in 1890 the idea that the brain and its function are not fixed throughout adulthood was proposed by william james in the principles of psychology though the idea was largely neglected up until the 1970s neuroscientists believed that the brains structure and function was essentially fixed throughout adulthood,0
in 1988 after prompting from the united states congress the national institute of general medical sciences national institutes of health nigms instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish biotechnology training programs btps each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed graduate students in turn compete for acceptance into a btp if accepted then stipend tuition and health insurance support are provided for two or three years during the course of their phd thesis work nineteen institutions offer nigms supported btps biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community collegescitation needed,0
also when a low fodmap diet is used without a previous complete medical evaluation can cause serious health risks it can ameliorate and mask the digestive symptoms of serious diseases such as celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer avoiding their correct diagnosis and therapy this is especially relevant in the case of celiac disease since the consumption of gluten is suppressed or reduced with a lowfodmap diet the improvement of the digestive symptoms with this diet may not be related to the withdrawal of the fodmaps but of gluten indicating the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease avoiding its diagnosis and correct treatment with the consequent risk of several serious health complications including various types of cancer,0
adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding atrisk areas learning to live with increased flooding and building flood controls if that fails managed retreat may be needed there are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody in agriculture adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets diversification erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate insurance allows for risksharing but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes education migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms,0

complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine complementary medicine refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine while alternative medicine refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted cancer researcher andrew j vickers stated the label unproven is inappropriate for such therapies it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been disproven,0
there are two mass spectrometrybased methods currently used for protein profiling the more established and widespread method uses high resolution twodimensional electrophoresis to separate proteins from different samples in parallel followed by selection and staining of differentially expressed proteins to be identified by mass spectrometry despite the advances in 2de and its maturity it has its limits as well the central concern is the inability to resolve all the proteins within a sample given their dramatic range in expression level and differing properties the combination of pore size and protein charge size and shape can greatly determine migration rate which leads to other complications,0
in the middle of the 16th century a doctor from verona named girolamo fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that the very small unseeable particles that cause disease were alive they were considered to be able to spread by air multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire in this way he refuted galens miasma theory poison gas in sick people in 1543 he wrote a book de contagione et contagiosis morbis in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease the development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by antonie van leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of diseasecitation needed,0
in the 19th century physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate in particular with the 1838 appearance of the cell theory of matthias schleiden and theodor schwann it radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells claude bernards 18131878 further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of milieu interieur internal environment which would later be taken up and championed as homeostasis by american physiologist walter b cannon in 1929 by homeostasis cannon meant the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated in other words the bodys ability to regulate its internal environment william beaumont was the first american to utilize the practical application of physiology,0
many more gene sequences are known than protein structures further the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in xray crystallography one of the major structure determination methods in particular globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for xray crystallography membrane proteins and large protein complexes by contrast are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the pdb structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined,0
some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing for example sugars that are whitened with bone char cheeses that use animal rennet enzymes from animal stomach lining gelatin derived from the collagen inside animals skin bones and connective tissue some cane sugar but not beet sugar and beverages such as apple juice and alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients in the 21st century 90 of rennet and chymosin used in cheesemaking are derived from industrial fermentation processes which satisfy both kosher and halal requirements,0
selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array caa it gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward by introducing emotion as an internal reward emotion is used as state evaluation of a selflearning agent the caa selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion the selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix w was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine,0

the socalled mediterranean diet prevalent in many countries in the mediterranean sea area includes more total fat than the diet of northern european countries but most of it is in the form of unsaturated fatty acids specifically monounsaturated and omega3 from olive oil and fish vegetables and certain meats like lamb while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison a 2017 review found evidence that a mediterraneanstyle diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases overall cancer incidence neurodegenerative diseases diabetes and mortality rate a 2018 review showed that a mediterraneanlike diet may improve overall health status such as reduced risk of noncommunicable diseases it also may reduce the social and economic costs of dietrelated illnesses,0
the primary circadian clock in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus or nuclei scn a pair of distinct groups of cells located in the hypothalamus destruction of the scn results in the complete absence of a regular sleepwake rhythm the scn receives information about illumination through the eyes the retina of the eye contains classical photoreceptors rods and cones which are used for conventional vision but the retina also contains specialized ganglion cells that are directly photosensitive and project directly to the scn where they help in the entrainment synchronization of this master circadian clock the proteins involved in the scn clock are homologous to those found in the fruit fly,0
the value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial this concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of crosscontact or crosscontamination at any point along the food chain during raw material transportation storage or handling due to shared equipment for processing and packaging etc experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated,0
studies have yielded mixed evidence regarding the impact of psychosomatic factors in illnesses early evidence suggested that patients with advancedstage cancer may be able to survive longer if provided with psychotherapy to improve their social support and outlook however a major review published in 2007 which evaluated the evidence for these benefits concluded that no studies meeting the minimum quality standards required in this field have demonstrated such a benefit the review further argues that unsubstantiated claims that positive outlook or fighting spirit can help slow cancer may be harmful to the patients themselves if they come to believe that their poor progress results from not having the right attitude,0
once the embryo reaches four weeks of gestation the parathyroid glands begins to develop the human embryo forms five sets of endodermlined pharyngeal pouches the third and fourth pouch are responsible for developing into the inferior and superior parathyroid glands respectively the third pharyngeal pouch encounters the developing thyroid gland and they migrate down to the lower poles of the thyroid lobes the fourth pharyngeal pouch later encounters the developing thyroid gland and migrates to the upper poles of the thyroid lobes at 14 weeks of gestation the parathyroid glands begin to enlarge from 01 mm in diameter to approximately 1  2 mm at birth the developing parathyroid glands are physiologically functional beginning in the second trimester,0
during the covid19 pandemic some academics insisted that the mrna vaccines for covid were not gene therapy to prevent the spread of incorrect information that the vaccine could alter dna other academics maintained that the vaccines were a gene therapy because they introduced genetic material into a cell factcheckers such as full fact reuters politifact and factcheckorg said that calling the vaccines a gene therapy was incorrect podcast host joe rogan was criticized for calling mrna vaccines gene therapy as was british politician andrew bridgen with fact checker full fact calling for bridgen to be removed from the conservative party for this and other statements,0
organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food some simple parasites such as the bacteria mycoplasma pneumoniae lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts all amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis the citric acid cycle or the pentose phosphate pathway nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine nonessensial amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alphaketo acid which is then transaminated to form an amino acid,0
vitamins are classified as either watersoluble or fatsoluble in humans there are 13 vitamins 4 fatsoluble a d e and k and 9 watersoluble 8 b vitamins and vitamin c watersoluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and in general are readily excreted from the body to the degree that urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption because they are not as readily stored more consistent intake is important fatsoluble vitamins are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract with the help of lipids fats vitamins a and d can accumulate in the body which can result in dangerous hypervitaminosis fatsoluble vitamin deficiency due to malabsorption is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis,0
for ulcerative colitis there is lowcertainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission people receiving probiotics were 73 more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy the likelihood of remission was 22 higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5aminosalicylic acid therapy whereas in people who are already in remission it is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse either as a monotherapy or combination therapy,0
an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happend in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility,0
in sporadic cancers deficiencies in dna repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a dna repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of dna repair genes this is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level many studies of heavy metalinduced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of dna repair enzymes some through epigenetic mechanisms dna repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metalinduced carcinogenicity in addition frequent epigenetic alterations of the dna sequences code for small rnas called micrornas or mirnas mirnas do not code for proteins but can target proteincoding genes and reduce their expression,0
a 2008 controlled study out of stanford university school of medicine suggested cbt may be an effective tool to help maintain abstinence the results of 304 random adult participants were tracked over the course of one year during this program some participants were provided medication cbt 24hour phone support or some combination of the three methods at 20 weeks the participants who received cbt had a 45 abstinence rate versus noncbt participants who had a 29 abstinence rate overall the study concluded that emphasizing cognitive and behavioral strategies to support smoking cessation can help individuals build tools for long term smoking abstinence,0

darwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology by uniting them in a common biological theory the theory of organic evolution the result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis fresh investigation of the development of animals and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships the end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery in the early 20th century the rediscovery of mendels work led to the rapid development of genetics and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the modern synthesis created evolutionary biology,0
renewable energy is key to limiting climate change for decades fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80 of the worlds energy use the remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables including hydropower bioenergy wind and solar power and geothermal energy fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions renewables represented 86 of all new electricity generation installed in 2023 other forms of clean energy such as nuclear and hydropower currently have a larger share of the energy supply however their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison,0
the most commonly understood version of the mediterranean diet was presented by among others walter willett and colleagues of the harvard university school of public health since the mid1990s the mediterranean diet is based on a paradox although the people living in mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat they have far lower rates of cardiovascular disease than in countries such as the united states where similar levels of fat consumption are found a parallel phenomenon is known as the french paradox by 2011 the mediterranean diet was included by some authors as a fad diet promoted for losing weight,0
different regions of the world warm at different rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the preindustrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature this is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents,0
for developing countries telemedicine and ehealth can be the only means of healthcare provision in remote areas for example the difficult financial situation in many african states and lack of trained health professionals has meant that the majority of the people in subsaharan africa are badly disadvantaged in medical care and in remote areas with low population density direct healthcare provision is often very poor however provision of telemedicine and ehealth from urban centers or from other countries is hampered by the lack of communications infrastructure with no landline phone or broadband internet connection little or no mobile connectivity and often not even a reliable electricity supply,0

in order to replicate viruses introduce their genetic material into the host cell tricking the hosts cellular machinery into using it as blueprints for viral proteins 39 retroviruses go a stage further by having their genetic material copied into the nuclear genome of the host cell scientists exploit this by substituting part of a viruss genetic material with therapeutic dna or rna 40 like the genetic material dna or rna in viruses therapeutic genetic material can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that degrades naturally as in a nonintegrative vectors or to enter the hosts nucleus becoming a permanent part of the hosts nuclear dna in infected cells 50,0
the habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result more specifically habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable that is any component or characteristic of the environment related directly eg forage biomass and quality or indirectly eg elevation to the use of a location by the animal 745 for example a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem,0
fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetylcoa units the acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group reduce it to an alcohol dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group the enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type i protein while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type ii enzymes perform each step in the pathway,0
autografts are the transplant of tissue to the same person sometimes this is done with surplus tissue tissue that can regenerate or tissues more desperately needed elsewhere examples include skin grafts vein extraction for cabg etc sometimes an autograft is done to remove the tissue and then treat it or the person before returning it examples include stem cell autograft and storing blood in advance of surgery in a rotationplasty a distal joint is used to replace a more proximal one typically a foot or ankle joint is used to replace a knee joint the persons foot is severed and reversed the knee removed and the tibia joined with the femurcitation needed,0
intertidal zones the areas that are close to the shore are constantly being exposed and covered by the oceans tides a huge array of life can be found within this zone shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence it can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently many species here are scavengers living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats a subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of bioerosion,0
data from who and the world bank indicate that scaling up infrastructure to enable access to surgical care in regions where it is currently limited or is nonexistent is a lowcost measure relative to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by lack of surgical treatment in fact a systematic review found that the costeffectiveness ratio  dollars spent per dalys averted  for surgical interventions is on par or exceeds those of major public health interventions such as oral rehydration therapy breastfeeding promotion and even hivaids antiretroviral therapy this finding challenged the common misconception that surgical care is financially prohibitive endeavor not worth pursuing in lmics,0
astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects rather than their positions or motions in space among the objects studied are the sun other stars galaxies extrasolar planets the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and the properties examined include luminosity density temperature and chemical composition because astrophysics is a very broad subject astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics including mechanics electromagnetism statistical mechanics thermodynamics quantum mechanics relativity nuclear and particle physics and atomic and molecular physicscitation needed,0
mass spectrometry and microarray produce peptide fragmentation information but do not give identification of specific proteins present in the original sample due to the lack of specific protein identification past researchers were forced to decipher the peptide fragments themselves however there are currently programs available for protein identification these programs take the peptide sequences output from mass spectrometry and microarray and return information about matching or similar proteins this is done through algorithms implemented by the program which perform alignments with proteins from known databases such as uniprot and prosite to predict what proteins are in the sample with a degree of certainty,0
the world health organization who recommends a pain ladder for managing pain relief with pharmaceutical medicine it was first described for use in cancer pain however it can be used by medical professionals as a general principle when managing any type of pain in the treatment of chronic pain the threestep who analgesic ladder provides guidelines for selecting the appropriate medicine the exact medications recommended will vary by country and the individual treatment center but the following gives an example of the who approach to treating chronic pain with medications if at any point treatment fails to provide adequate pain relief then the doctor and patient move onto the next stepcitation needed,0
the importance of doubleblinding was shown in a metaanalysis that examined the effectiveness of cbt when placebo control and blindness were factored in pooled data from published trials of cbt in schizophrenia major depressive disorder mdd and bipolar disorder that used controls for nonspecific effects of intervention were analyzed this study concluded that cbt is no better than nonspecific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates treatment effects are small in treatment studies of mdd and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder for mdd the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low,0
comparative proteomic analysis may reveal the role of proteins in complex biological systems including reproduction for example treatment with the insecticide triazophos causes an increase in the content of brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens stl male accessory gland proteins acps that may be transferred to females via mating causing an increase in fecundity ie birth rate of females to identify changes in the types of accessory gland proteins acps and reproductive proteins that mated female planthoppers received from male planthoppers researchers conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of mated n lugens females the results indicated that these proteins participate in the reproductive process of n lugens adult females and males,0
physiology studies the mechanical physical and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole the theme of structure to function is central to biology physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology but some principles of physiology are universal no matter what particular organism is being studied for example what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells the field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to nonhuman species physiology studies how for example the nervous immune endocrine respiratory and circulatory systems function and interact,0
recently advertisements for food and beverages directed at children have received much attention the childrens food and beverage advertising initiative cfbai is a selfregulatory program of the food industry each participating company makes a public pledge that details its commitment to advertise only foods that meet certain nutritional criteria to children under 12 years old this is a selfregulated program with policies written by the council of better business bureaus the robert wood johnson foundation funded research to test the efficacy of the cfbai the results showed progress in terms of decreased advertising of food products that target children and adolescents,0
the existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidencebased policymaking for example in south africa whose population sets the record for hiv infections previous government policy limiting funding and access for aids treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission a change of government eventually led to a change in policy with new policies implemented for widespread access to hiv services another issue relates to intellectual property as illustrated by the case of brazil where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of hivaids in violation of drug patents,0
thus the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically is currently available the only remaining blockades to the use of pcr as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application neither of which is insurmountable the diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of pcr methods such as some of the clostridial diseases tetanus and botulism these diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent neurotoxins a significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur this limits the ability of pcr to detect the presence of any bacteria,0
public health issues were important for the spanish empire during the colonial era epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenthcentury conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era the spanish crown took steps in eighteenthcentury mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier in the late nineteenth century mexico was in the process of modernization and public health issues were again tackled from a scientific point of view as in the us food safety became a public health issue particularly focusing on meat slaughterhouses and meatpacking,0
a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams,0
a key part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak known as flattening the curve this helps decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for a vaccine and treatment to be developed a broad group of nonpharmaceutical interventions may be taken to manage the outbreak in a flu pandemic these actions may include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene wearing facemasks and selfquarantine community measures aimed at social distancing such as closing schools and canceling mass gatherings community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions and environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces,0
around 1920 following the discovery of the hertzsprungrussell diagram still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution arthur eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars in his paper the internal constitution of the stars at that time the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium liberating enormous energy according to einsteins equation e  mc2 this was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen see metallicity had not yet been discovered,0
in 1783 ferdinand ueberwasser 17521812 designated himself professor of empirical psychology and logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology though these developments were soon overshadowed by the napoleonic wars at the end of the napoleonic era prussian authorities discontinued the old university of mnster having consulted philosophers hegel and herbart however in 1825 the prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system however this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation in england early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism violence and the countrys crowded lunatic asylums,0
in the extreme case of performanceenhancing substances athletes particularly bodybuilders may choose to use illegal substances such as anabolic steroids these compounds which are related to the hormone testosterone can quickly build mass and strength but have many adverse effects such as high blood pressure and negative gender specific effects blood doping another illegal ergogenic was discovered in the 1940s when it was used by world war ii pilots blood doping also known as blood transfusions increases oxygen delivery to exercising tissues and has been demonstrated to improve performance in endurance sports such as longdistance cycling blood doping is banned by international olympic committee and other international sport authorities and federations,0
prior to the 18th century caring for pregnant women in europe was confined exclusively to women and rigorously excluded men the expectant mother would invite close female friends and family members to her home to keep her company during childbirth 9698 skilled midwives managed all aspects of the labour and delivery the presence of physicians and surgeons was very rare and only occurred if a serious complication had taken place and the midwife had exhausted all measures at her disposal calling a surgeon was very much a last resort and having men deliver women in this era was seen as offending female modesty 10501051,0
the recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10 to 20 higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150 higher in the first year of life cysteine or sulfurcontaining amino acids tyrosine or aromatic amino acids and arginine are always required by infants and growing children methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine smethyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because tyrosine can be synthesized from phenylalanine using the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase,0
in a 2015 article reviewing research on the use of a mobile health application in the united kingdom authors describe how a homebased application helped patients manage and monitor their health and symptoms independently the mobile health application allows people to rapidly selfreport their symptoms  95 of patients were able to report their daily symptoms in less than 100 seconds which is less than the 5 minutes plus commuting taken to measure vital signs by nurses in hospitals online applications allow patients to remain at home to keep track of the progression of their chronic illnesses the downside of using mhealth applications is that not everyone especially in developing countries has daily access to internet or electronic devices,0
habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy for example one population of a species of tropical lizard tropidurus hispidus has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna the population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats biotope and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably but the former applies to a communitys environment whereas the latter applies to a species environment,0
scientists are working on a new kind of artificial rbc which is onefiftieth the size of a human rbc they are made from purified human hemoglobin proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer thanks to the special materials of the artificial rbc they can capture oxygen when blood ph is high and release oxygen when blood ph is low the polymer coating also keeps the hemoglobin from reacting with nitric oxide in the bloodstream thus preventing dangerous constriction of the blood vessels allan doctor md stated that the artificial rbc can be used by anyone with any blood type because the coating is immune silent,0
due to the prevalence of fungi in the natural environment determining which genera and species are permanent members of the gut mycobiome is difficult research is underway as to whether penicillium is a permanent or transient member of the gut flora obtained from dietary sources such as cheese though several species in the genus are known to survive at temperatures around 37c about the same as the core body temperature saccharomyces cerevisiae brewers yeast is known to reach the intestines after being ingested and can be responsible for the condition autobrewery syndrome in cases where it is overabundant while candida albicans is likely a permanent member and is believed to be acquired at birth through vertical transmissionmedical citation needed,0
emotional mental illnesses is a particular concern in the united states since the us has the highest annual prevalence rates 26 percent for mental illnesses among a comparison of 14 developing and developed countries while approximately 80 percent of all people in the united states with a mental disorder eventually receive some form of treatment on average persons do not access care until nearly a decade following the development of their illness and less than onethird of people who seek help receive minimally adequate care the government offers everyone programs and services but veterans receive the most help there is certain eligibility criteria that has to be met,0
snells law can be used to predict the deflection of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of the media are known for example the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism in most materials the index of refraction varies with the frequency of the light known as dispersion taking this into account snells law can be used to predict how a prism will disperse light into a spectrum the discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to isaac newton,0
reducedosmolarity ors is the current standard of care for oral rehydration therapy with reasonably wide availability introduced in 2003 by who and unicef reducedosmolarity solutions contain lower concentrations of sodium and glucose than original ors preparations reducedosmolarity ors has the added benefit of reducing stool volume and vomiting while simultaneously preventing dehydration packets of reducedosmolarity ors include glucose table salt potassium chloride and trisodium citrate for general use each packet should be mixed with a liter of water however for malnourished children experts recommend adding a packet of ors to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose and some stock potassium solution,0
in developing nations in latin america such as chile colombia costa rica and cuba both public and privately organized programs have offered women routine cytological screening since the 1970s however these efforts have not resulted in a significant change in cervical cancer incidence or mortality in these nations this is likely due to low quality inefficient testing however puerto rico which has offered early screening since the 1960s has witnessed almost a 50 decline in cervical cancer incidence and almost a fourfold decrease in mortality between 1950 and 1990 brazil peru india and several highrisk nations in subsaharan africa which lack organized screening programs have a high incidence of cervical cancer,0
mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible,0
light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarised except when the light is normal perpendicular to the surface it was this effect that allowed the mathematician tiennelouis malus to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light polarisation occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere the scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies this partial polarisation of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarising filters to darken the sky in photographs optical polarisation is principally of importance in chemistry due to circular dichroism and optical rotation circular birefringence exhibited by optically active chiral molecules,0
in the middle figure the two orthogonal components have the same amplitudes and are 90 out of phase in this case one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude there are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement the x component can be 90 ahead of the y component or it can be 90 behind the y component in this special case the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane so this polarisation is called circular polarisation the rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the twophase relationships exists and corresponds to righthand circular polarisation and lefthand circular polarisation,0
precision medicine often involves the application of panomic analysis and systems biology to analyze the cause of an individual patients disease at the molecular level and then to utilize targeted treatments possibly in combination to address that individual patients disease process the patients response is then tracked as closely as possible often using surrogate measures such as tumor load versus true outcomes such as fiveyear survival rate and the treatment finely adapted to the patients response the branch of precision medicine that addresses cancer is referred to as precision oncology the field of precision medicine that is related to psychiatric disorders and mental health is called precision psychiatry,0
fiduciary markers are used in a wide range of medical imaging applications images of the same subject produced with two different imaging systems may be correlated called image registration by placing a fiduciary marker in the area imaged by both systems in this case a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used by this method functional information from spect or positron emission tomography can be related to anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging mri similarly fiducial points established during mri can be correlated with brain images generated by magnetoencephalography to localize the source of brain activity,0
the 1730 definition of the word chemistry as used by georg ernst stahl meant the art of resolving mixed compound or aggregate bodies into their principles and of composing such bodies from those principles in 1837 jeanbaptiste dumas considered the word chemistry to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces this definition further evolved until in 1947 it came to mean the science of substances their structure their properties and the reactions that change them into other substancesa characterization accepted by linus pauling more recently in 1998 professor raymond chang broadened the definition of chemistry to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes,0
the use of technology in health care settings has become popular and this trend is expected to continue various health care facilities had instigated different kinds of health information technology systems in the provision of patient care such as electronic health records ehrs computerized charting etc the growing popularity of health information technology systems and the escalation in the amount of health information that can be exchanged and transferred electronically increased the risk of potential infringement in patients privacy and confidentiality this concern triggered the establishment of strict measures by both policymakers and individual facility to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality,0
recently there has been a rise in frequency of appearance of new zoonotic diseases approximately 167 million undescribed viruses are thought to exist in mammals and birds up to half of which are estimated to have the potential to spill over into humans says a study led by researchers at the university of california davis according to a report from the united nations environment programme and international livestock research institute a large part of the causes are environmental like climate change unsustainable agriculture exploitation of wildlife and land use change others are linked to changes in human society such as an increase in mobility the organizations propose a set of measures to stop the rise,0
if the state for a composite system is entangled it is impossible to describe either component system a or system b by a state vector one can instead define reduced density matrices that describe the statistics that can be obtained by making measurements on either component system alone this necessarily causes a loss of information though knowing the reduced density matrices of the individual systems is not enough to reconstruct the state of the composite system just as density matrices specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system analogously positive operatorvalued measures povms describe the effect on a subsystem of a measurement performed on a larger system povms are extensively used in quantum information theory,0
environmental biotechnology includes various disciplines that play an essential role in reducing environmental waste and providing environmentally safe processes such as biofiltration and biodegradation the environment can be affected by biotechnologies both positively and adversely vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology eg bioremediation is to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises eg flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains can be seen as applications and implications respectively cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnologycitation needed,0
telemedicine also known as telehealth is a way for patients to interact with their doctors virtually according to the national library of medicine nih the definition of telehealth is the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants telehealth is an umbrella term that encompasses various applications of electronics in medicine the more common uses of technology involve calling patients to let them know their lab results are in or communication between emergency departments on the other hand there are more complex uses of technology called telesurgery while there are two extremes of the uses of telehealth the more recent applications of telehealth involve patient and healthcareprofessional interaction,0
early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the schrdinger equation with a covariant equation such as the kleingordon equation or the dirac equation while these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles a fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory which applies quantization to a field rather than a fixed set of particles the first complete quantum field theory quantum electrodynamics provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction quantum electrodynamics is along with general relativity one of the most accurate physical theories ever devised,0
the earth was formed approximately 45 billion years ago as it cooled and a crust and oceans formed its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia over the next billion years the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of carbon dioxide nitrogen and water vapor these gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the earths surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat there were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and in turn the atmosphere also evolved,0
the amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by william cumming rose the experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students these diets consisted of corn starch sucrose butterfat without protein corn oil inorganic salts the known vitamins a large brown candy made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil to supply any unknown vitamins and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids the main outcome measure was nitrogen balance rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness exhaustion and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid,0
the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw is the governmental agency overseeing occupational safety and health in japan the mhlw is responsible for enforcing industrial safety and health act of 1972  the key piece of osh legislation in japan  setting regulations and guidelines supervising labor inspectors who monitor workplaces for compliance with safety and health standards investigating accidents and issuing orders to improve safety conditions the labor standards bureau is an arm of mhlw tasked with supervising and guiding businesses inspecting manufacturing facilities for safety and compliance investigating accidents collecting statistics enforcing regulations and administering fines for safety violations and paying accident compensation for injured workers,0
a balanced diet includes appropriate amounts of all essential and nonessential nutrients these can vary by age weight sex physical activity levels and more a lack of just one essential nutrient can cause bodily harm just as an overabundance can cause toxicity the daily reference values keep the majority of people from nutrient deficiencies drvs are not recommendations but a combination of nutrient references to educate professionals and policymakers on what the maximum and minimum nutrient intakes are for the average person food labels also use drvs as a reference to create safe nutritional guidelines for the average healthy person,0
because ct and mri are sensitive to different tissue properties the appearances of the images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly in ct xrays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image so the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor in mri while any nucleus with a net nuclear spin can be used the proton of the hydrogen atom remains the most widely used especially in the clinical setting because it is so ubiquitous and returns a large signal this nucleus present in water molecules allows the excellent softtissue contrast achievable with mricitation needed,0
a large number of studies have demonstrated the metabolism of over 50 drugs by the gut microbiota for example lovastatin a cholesterollowering agent which is a lactone prodrug is partially activated by the human gut microbiota forming active acid hydroxylated metabolites conversely digoxin a drug used to treat congestive heart failure is inactivated by a member of the gut microbiota ie eggerthella lanta eggerthella lanta has a cytochromeencoding operon upregulated by digoxin and associated with digoxininactivation gut microbiota can also modulate the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents such as irinotecan this effect is derived from the microbiomeencoded glucuronidase enzymes which recover the active form of the irinotecan causing gastrointestinal toxicity,0
most arrhythmias can be effectively treated treatments may include medications medical procedures such as a pacemaker and surgery medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide this later group may have more significant side effects especially if taken for a long period of time pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia may receive urgent treatment with a jolt of electricity in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation,0
traditional marketing systems whether in china or the rest of asia presently provide little motivation or incentive for individual farmers to make improvements to either quality or safety as their produce tends to get grouped together with standard products as it progresses through the marketing channel direct linkages between farmer groups and traders or ultimate buyers such as supermarkets can help avoid this problem governments need to improve the condition of many markets through upgrading management and reinvesting market fees in physical infrastructure wholesale markets need to investigate the feasibility of developing separate sections to handle fruits and vegetables that meet defined safety and quality standards,0
the complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype some of these traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment while others are neutral some observable characteristics are not inherited for example suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a persons genotype and sunlight thus suntans are not passed on to peoples children the phenotype is the ability of the skin to tan when exposed to sunlight however some people tan more easily than others due to differences in genotypic variation a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn,0
the big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent largescale evolution despite its success in explaining many observed features of the universe including galactic redshifts the relative abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium and the existence of a cosmic microwave background there are several questions that remain unanswered for example the standard big bang model does not explain why the universe appears to be the same in all directions why it appears flat on very large distance scales or why certain hypothesized particles such as magnetic monopoles are not observed in experiments,0
noam chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language use the review which was scathing did much to reduce the status of behaviorism within psychology 2825 martin seligman and his colleagues discovered that they could condition in dogs a state of learned helplessness which was not predicted by the behaviorist approach to psychology edward c tolman advanced a hybrid cognitive behavioral model most notably with his 1948 publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a maze skinners behaviorism did not die in part because it generated successful practical applications,0
research has found evidence that light therapy such as low level laser therapy is an effective therapy for relieving low back pain instead of thermal therapy where reactant energy is originated through heat lowlevel light therapy lllt utilizes photochemical reactions requiring light to functioncitation needed photochemical reactions need light in order to function photons the energy created from light from these photochemical reactions provide the reactants with energy to embed in muscles thus managing pain one study conducted by stausholm et al showed that at certain wavelengths lllt reduced pain in participants with knee osteoarthritis lllt stimulates a variety of cell types which in turn can help treat tendonitis arthritis and pain relating to musclescitation needed,0
the functional development of the anterior pituitary involves spatiotemporal regulation of transcription factors expressed in pituitary stem cells and dynamic gradients of local soluble factors the coordination of the dorsal gradient of pituitary morphogenesis is dependent on neuroectodermal signals from the infundibular bone morphogenetic protein 4 bmp4 this protein is responsible for the development of the initial invagination of the rathkes pouch other essential proteins necessary for pituitary cell proliferation are fibroblast growth factor 8 fgf8 wnt4 and wnt5 ventral developmental patterning and the expression of transcription factors is influenced by the gradients of bmp2 and sonic hedgehog protein shh these factors are essential for coordinating early patterns of cell proliferation,0
western european byzantine and islamicate civilizations which generally adopted a hippocratic galenic or humoral medical system fostered preventive programs as well these were developed on the basis of evaluating the quality of local climates including topography wind conditions and exposure to the sun and the properties and availability of water and food for both humans and nonhuman animals diverse authors of medical architectural engineering and military manuals explained how to apply such theories to groups of different origins and under different circumstances this was crucial since under galenism bodily constitutions were thought to be heavily shaped by their material environments so their balance required specific regimens as they traveled during different seasons and between climate zones,0
in the expressions nx or x the symbol is a minus sign rather than a hyphen or dash although it is never read as such also the symbol n or  represents the locant of the methyl end counted from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid carbon chain for instance in an omega3 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms see illustration where the methyl end is at location 18 from the carboxyl end n or  represents the number 18 and the notation n3 or 3 represents the subtraction 183  15 where 15 is the locant of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end counted from the carboxyl end of the chain,0
ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china,0
atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere atmospheric physicists attempt to model earths atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations chemical models radiation balancing and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans and land in order to model weather systems atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory wave propagation models cloud physics statistical mechanics and spatial statistics each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide including remote sensing instruments,0
the concepts of personalised medicine can be applied to new and transformative approaches to health care personalised health care is based on the dynamics of systems biology and uses predictive tools to evaluate health risks and to design personalised health plans to help patients mitigate risks prevent disease and to treat it with precision when it occurs the concepts of personalised health care are receiving increasing acceptance with the veterans administration committing to personalised proactive patient driven care for all veterans in some instances personalised health care can be tailored to the markup of the disease causing agent instead of the patients genetic markup examples are drug resistant bacteria or viruses,0
theranostics is a personalized approach in nuclear medicine using similar molecules for both imaging diagnosis and therapy the term is a portmanteau of therapeutics and diagnostics its most common applications are attaching radionuclides either gamma or positron emitters to molecules for spect or pet imaging or electron emitters for radiotherapycitation needed one of the earliest examples is the use of radioactive iodine for treatment of people with thyroid cancer other examples include radiolabelled anticd20 antibodies eg bexxar for treating lymphoma radium223 for treating bone metastases lutetium177 dotatate for treating neuroendocrine tumors and lutetium177 psma for treating prostate cancer a commonly used reagent is fluorodeoxyglucose using the isotope fluorine18,0
a sequestered germ line or weismann barrier is specific to animals and epigenetic inheritance is more common in plants and microbes eva jablonka marion j lamb and tienne danchin have argued that these effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the modern synthesis and have called for an extended evolutionary synthesis other evolutionary biologists such as john maynard smith have incorporated epigenetic inheritance into populationgenetics models or are openly skeptical of the extended evolutionary synthesis michael lynch thomas dickins and qazi rahman state that epigenetic mechanisms such as dna methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and therefore fit under the earlier modern synthesis,0
air pollution is associated with adverse health effects like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases cancer related illnesses and even death the risk of air pollution is determined by the pollutants hazard and the amount of exposure that affects a person for example a child who plays outdoor sports will have a higher likelihood of outdoor air pollution exposure than an adult who tends to spend more time indoors whether at work or elsewhere environmental health officials work to detect individuals who are at higher risks of consuming air pollution work to decrease their exposure and detect risk factors present in communities,0
prevention is by eating a healthy diet regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking sometimes medication for diabetes high cholesterol or high blood pressure are also used there is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms treatment involves the same measures as prevention additional medications such as antiplatelets including aspirin beta blockers or nitroglycerin may be recommended procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention pci or coronary artery bypass surgery cabg may be used in severe disease in those with stable cad it is unclear if pci or cabg in addition to the other treatments improve life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk,0
molecular biology studies the common genetic and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants attempting to answer the questions regarding the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and the structure of the gene in 1953 james watson and francis crick described the structure of dna and the interactions within the molecule and this publication jumpstarted research into molecular biology and increased interest in the subject while researchers practice techniques specific to molecular biology it is common to combine these with methods from genetics and biochemistry much of molecular biology is quantitative and recently a significant amount of work has been done using computer science techniques such as bioinformatics and computational biology,0
learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have wellmanaged blood sugar levels the goal of treatment is an a1c level below 7 attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes these include smoking high blood pressure metabolic syndrome obesity and lack of regular exercise specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the pressure on the foot foot examination for patients living with diabetes should be done annually which includes sensation testing foot biomechanics vascular integrity and foot structure,0
often vegan or vegetarian characters are portrayed as fringe characters although other novels cast them as protagonists or encourage people to become vegetarians or vegans some have argued that there are more vegan cookbooks than vegan literature there are also books that introduce vegan identity to children or encourage people to write for animals also bruce banner in ultimate wolverine vs hulk and karolina dean in runaways who is also known as lucy in the sky or lsd are vegans the latter is a lesbian a vegan and an ardent animal lovercommitted to a life completely free of meat and dairy,0
"knowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide unfortunately most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions absent or competing visions for resources and nearconstant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements wmh surveys were done in africa nigeria south africa the americas colombia mexico united states asia and the pacific japan new zealand beijing and shanghai in the peoples republic of china europe belgium france germany italy netherlands spain ukraine and the middle east israel lebanon). countries were classified with world bank criteria as low-income (nigeria), lower-middle-income (china, colombia, south africa, ukraine), higher middle-income (lebanon, mexico), and high-income.",0
telehealth is a modern form of health care delivery telehealth breaks away from traditional health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods traditional health is legislated through policy to ensure the safety of medical practitioners and patients consequently since telehealth is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector many organizations have started to legislate the use of telehealth into policy in new zealand the medical council has a statement about telehealth on their website this illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that telehealth will have on the health system and have started to introduce telehealth legislation to practitioners along with government,0
radiation therapy is used in about half of cases the radiation can be either from internal sources brachytherapy or external sources the radiation is most commonly low energy xrays for treating skin cancers while higher energy xrays are used for cancers within the body radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy for certain types of cancer such as early head and neck cancer it may be used alone radiation therapy after surgery for brain metastases has been shown to not improve overall survival in patients compared to surgery alone for painful bone metastasis radiation therapy has been found to be effective in about 70 of patients,0
when the study of gut flora began in 1995 it was thought to have three key roles direct defense against pathogens fortification of host defense by its role in developing and maintaining the intestinal epithelium and inducing antibody production there and metabolizing otherwise indigestible compounds in food subsequent work discovered its role in training the developing immune system and yet further work focused on its role in the gutbrain axis the gut microbiota not only influences intestinal health but also plays a role in systemic immune regulation including interactions with the pulmonary immune environment through what is known as the gutlung axis,0
the first approved gene therapy clinical research in the us took place on 14 september 1990 at the national institutes of health nih under the direction of william french anderson fouryearold ashanti desilva received treatment for a genetic defect that left her with adenosine deaminase deficiency adascid a severe immune system deficiency the defective gene of the patients blood cells was replaced by the functional variant ashantis immune system was partially restored by the therapy production of the missing enzyme was temporarily stimulated but the new cells with functional genes were not generated she led a normal life only with the regular injections performed every two months the effects were successful but temporary,0
physiological antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions depending on whether they are soluble in water hydrophilic or in lipids lipophilic in general watersoluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma while lipidsoluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation these compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet the different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in body fluids and tissues with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells while others such as uric acid are more systemically distributed see table below some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and can be pathogens or virulence factors,0
a folkloric quotation often attributed tobut almost certainly not first formulated byedsger dijkstra states that computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopesnote 3 the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science for example the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems however there has been exchange of ideas between the various computerrelated disciplines computer science research also often intersects other disciplines such as cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics biology earth science statistics philosophy and logic,0
many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism these proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations and release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues the canonical example of a ligandbinding protein is haemoglobin which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom 22229 lectins are sugarbinding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins,0
steel and cement production are responsible for about 13 of industrial co2 emissions in these industries carbonintensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production so that reducing co2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries where energy production or co2intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste co2 technology can sometimes be used to capture and store most of the gas instead of releasing it to the atmosphere this technology carbon capture and storage ccs could have a critical but limited role in reducing emissions it is relatively expensive and has been deployed only to an extent that removes around 01 of annual greenhouse gas emissions,0
most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease disability and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions however public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine although the collaboration of local health and government agencies is considered best practice to improve public health the pieces of evidence available to support this is limited public health programs providing vaccinations have made major progress in promoting health including substantially reducing the occurrence of cholera and polio and eradicating smallpox diseases that have plagued humanity for thousands of years,0
the vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts the central nervous system defined as the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system in many speciesincluding all vertebratesthe nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body with most of the complexity residing in the brain the human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled at least one out of three of the approximately 20000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain,0
a vegetable is a part of a plant consumed by humans that is generally savory but is not sweet a vegetable is not considered a grain fruit nut spice or herb for example the stem root flower etc may be eaten as vegetables vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals however different vegetables contain different balances of micronutrients so it is important to eat a wide variety of types for example orange and dark green vegetables typically contain vitamin a dark green vegetables contain vitamin c and vegetables like broccoli and related plants contain iron and calcium vegetables are very low in fats and calories but ingredients added in preparation can often add them,0
there are two groups of infectious disease that may be affected by climate change the first group are vectorborne diseases which are transmitted via insects such as mosquitos or ticks some of these diseases such as malaria yellow fever and dengue fever can have potentially severe health consequences climate can affect the distribution of these diseases due to the changing geographic range of their vectors with the potential to cause serious outbreaks in areas where the disease has not previously been known the other group comprises waterborne diseases such as cholera dysentery and typhoid which may increase in prevalence due to changes in rainfall patterns,0
an october 2001 report by the world health organization who defines probiotics as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host following this definition a working group convened by the food and agriculture organization faowho in may 2002 issued the guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics in food a consensus definition of the term probiotics based on available information and scientific evidence was adopted after the aforementioned joint expert consultation between the fao of the united nations and the who this effort was accompanied by local governmental and supragovernmental regulatory bodies requirements to better characterize health claims substantiationscitation needed,0
if the patient is allergic to the substance then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes this response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a fullblown hive called wheal and flare in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity with  meaning borderline reactivity and 4 being a large reaction increasingly allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction interpretation by welltrained allergists is often guided by relevant literature,0
in the branch of physics called statistical mechanics entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a physical system this concept was studied in the 1870s by the austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann who showed that the thermodynamic properties of a gas could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent molecules boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume temperature and pressure in addition this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the natural logarithm of the number of different states of the molecules also called microstates that give rise to the same macroscopic features,0
as a series of operational protocols used for performing research namely a cycle composed of theory analytic or computational modelling to propose specific testable hypotheses about a biological system experimental validation and then using the newly acquired quantitative description of cells or cell processes to refine the computational model or theory since the objective is a model of the interactions in a system the experimental techniques that most suit systems biology are those that are systemwide and attempt to be as complete as possible therefore transcriptomics metabolomics proteomics and highthroughput techniques are used to collect quantitative data for the construction and validation of models,0
the type of organism determines what nutrients it needs and how it obtains them organisms obtain nutrients by consuming organic matter consuming inorganic matter absorbing light or some combination of these some can produce nutrients internally by consuming basic elements while some must consume other organisms to obtain preexisting nutrients all forms of life require carbon energy and water as well as various other molecules animals require complex nutrients such as carbohydrates lipids and proteins obtaining them by consuming other organisms humans have developed agriculture and cooking to replace foraging and advance human nutrition plants acquire nutrients through the soil and the atmosphere fungi absorb nutrients around them by breaking them down and absorbing them through the mycelium,0
human herpesvirus 6 hhv6 reactivation emerges as a notable concern in pediatric liver transplantation potentially influencing both graft and recipient health hhv6 prevalent in a substantial portion of the population can manifest in liver transplant recipients with inherited chromosomally integrated hhv6 icihhv6 predisposing them to heightened risks of complications such as graftversushost disease and allograft rejections recent case studies underscore the significance of hhv6 reactivation demonstrating its ability to infect liver grafts and impact recipient outcomes clinical management involves early detection targeted antiviral therapy and vigilant monitoring posttransplantation with future research aimed at optimizing preventive measures and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the impact of hhv6 reactivation on pediatric liver transplant outcomes,0
approximately 80 of deaths linked to noncommunicable diseases occur in developing countries for instance urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to noncommunicable diseases in india similarly chinas rapid urbanization and modernization have been associated with increased sedentary lifestyles contributing to the rise in ncds in the region the fastestgrowing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes rate increased by 80 and ischemic heart disease up 34 more than 60 of deaths about 61 million in 2016 were due to ncds up from about 38 in 1990 increases in refugee urbanization has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases,0
importantly the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic if the environment changes previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful however even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way traits that were lost in the past may not reevolve in an identical form however a reactivation of dormant genes as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations can lead to the reoccurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in dolphins teeth in chickens wings in wingless stick insects tails and additional nipples in humans etc throwbacks such as these are known as atavisms,0
infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious diseases when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions eg influenza thus a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted all contagious diseases are infectious but not vice versa other types of infectious transmissible or communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection such as vector transmission or sexual transmission are usually not regarded as contagious and often do not require medical isolation sometimes loosely called quarantine of those affected however this specialized connotation of the word contagious and contagious disease easy transmissibility is not always respected in popular use,0
the history of the biological foundations of psychology includes evidence of racism the idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by europeans carl von linnaeuss fourfold classification of humans classifies europeans as intelligent and severe americans as contented and free asians as ritualistic and africans as lazy and capricious race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and dysaesthesia aethiopicathe behavior of uncooperative african slaves after the creation of experimental psychology ethnical psychology emerged as a subdiscipline based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans,0
"the term is most common in biochemistry where it is a synonym of saccharide from ancient greek  skkharon sugar a group that includes sugars starch and cellulose the saccharides are divided into four chemical groups monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides monosaccharides and disaccharides the smallest lower molecular weight carbohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars while the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix ose which was originally taken from the word glucose from ancient greek  glekos wine must and is used for almost all sugars (e.g., fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose (cane or beet sugar), ribose, lactose (milk sugar)).",0

in one prominent study neurolinguists used a voxelbased morphometry vbm method to visualize the structural plasticity of brains in healthy monolinguals and bilinguals they first investigated the differences in density of grey and white matter between two groups and found the relationship between brain structure and age of language acquisition the results showed that greymatter density in the inferior parietal cortex for multilinguals were significantly greater than monolinguals the researchers also found that early bilinguals had a greater density of grey matter relative to late bilinguals in the same region the inferior parietal cortex is a brain region highly associated with the language learning which corresponds to the vbm result of the study,0
enteral administration is food or drug administration via the human gastrointestinal tract this contrasts with parenteral nutrition or drug administration greek para besides  enteros which occurs from routes outside the gi tract such as intravenous routes enteral administration involves the esophagus stomach and small and large intestines ie the gastrointestinal tract methods of administration include oral sublingual dissolving the drug under the tongue and rectal parenteral administration is via a peripheral or central vein in pharmacology the route of drug administration is important because it affects drug metabolism drug clearance and thus dosage the term is from greek enteros intestine,0
the fats group as a whole have been put at the tip of the pyramid under the direction to eat as little as possible which some people have considered problematic the guide instructs people to limit fat intake as much as possible which can cause health problems because fat is essential to overall health research suggests that unsaturated fats aid in weight loss reduce heart disease risk lower blood sugar and even lower cholesterol also they are very long sustaining and help keep blood sugar at a steady level on top of that these fats help brain function as well,0
the health capital model explains how individual investments in health can increase earnings by increasing the number of healthy days available to work and to earn income in this context health can be treated both as a consumption good wherein individuals desire health because it improves quality of life in the present and as an investment good because of its potential to increase attendance and workplace productivity over time preventive health behaviors such as healthful diet regular exercise access to and use of wellcare avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol can be viewed as health inputs that result in both a healthier workforce and substantial cost savingscitation needed,0
according to the official estimates of the united nations the whoilo joint estimate of the workrelated burden of disease and injury almost 2 million people die each year due to exposure to occupational risk factors globally more than 278 million people die annually as a result of workplacerelated accidents or diseases corresponding to one death every fifteen seconds there are an additional 374 million nonfatal workrelated injuries annually it is estimated that the economic burden of occupationalrelated injury and death is nearly four per cent of the global gross domestic product each year the human cost of this adversity is enormous,0
in theory there are no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants however fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues a culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet when families dine together sharing the same meal it can be difficult to separate the childs meal in many countries food labelling is not mandatory so calculating macronutrients such as fat protein and carbohydrates can be difficult in some countries it may be hard to find sugarfree forms of medicines and supplements to purchase an accurate electronic scale or to afford mct oils,0
particles that deposit in the upper and central airways are generally absorbed systemically to great extent because they are only partially removed by mucociliary clearance which results in orally mediated absorption when the transported mucus is swallowed and first pass metabolism or incomplete absorption through loss at the fecal route can sometimes reduce the bioavailability this should in no way suggest to clinicians or researchers that inhaled particles are not a greater threat than swallowed particles it merely signifies that a combination of both methods may occur with some particles no matter the size of or lipohydrophilicity of the different particle surfaces,0
inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines which are released by injured or infected cells eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells leukocytes common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells chemokines that promote chemotaxis and interferons that have antiviral effects such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released these cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens,0
only some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious the microorganisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria viruses protozoa and fungi infectious diseases can be transmitted eg by handtomouth contact with infectious material on surfaces by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease and from contaminated water or food often via fecal contamination etc also there are sexually transmitted diseases in some cases microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes,0
upon developing countries adopting who guidelines for vaccine development and licensure each country has its own responsibility to issue a national licensure and to manage deploy and monitor the vaccine throughout its use in each nation building trust and acceptance of a licensed vaccine among the public is a task of communication by governments and healthcare personnel to ensure a vaccination campaign proceeds smoothly saves lives and enables economic recovery when a vaccine is licensed it will initially be in limited supply due to variable manufacturing distribution and logistical factors requiring an allocation plan for the limited supply and which population segments should be prioritized to first receive the vaccine,0
the abundant inorganic elements act as electrolytes the most important ions are sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate the maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and ph ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cells fluid the cytosol electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels for example muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and ttubules,0
trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex systems view of ecosystems each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions giving a macroscopic view of the system while the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and topdown control within food webs it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems this has led some ecologists to reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete homogeneous trophic levels is fiction 815 nonetheless recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist but above the herbivore trophic level food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores 612,0
gel electrophoresis is a technique which separates molecules by their size using an agarose or polyacrylamide gel this technique is one of the principal tools of molecular biology the basic principle is that dna fragments can be separated by applying an electric current across the gel  because the dna backbone contains negatively charged phosphate groups the dna will migrate through the agarose gel towards the positive end of the current proteins can also be separated on the basis of size using an sdspage gel or on the basis of size and their electric charge by using what is known as a 2d gel electrophoresis,0
genetic processes work in combination with an organisms environment and experiences to influence development and behavior often referred to as nature versus nurture the intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription a classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate lacking sufficient waterfall or rain while the average height the two corn stalks could grow to is genetically determined the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment,0
more recent approaches such as those performed by companies such as ligandal offer the possibility of creating cellspecific targeting technologies for a variety of gene therapy modalities including rna dna and gene editing tools such as crispr other companies such as arbutus biopharma and arcturus therapeutics offer nonviral noncelltargeted approaches that mainly exhibit liver trophism in more recent years startups such as sixfold bio genedit and spotlight therapeutics have begun to solve the nonviral gene delivery problem nonviral techniques offer the possibility of repeat dosing and greater tailorability of genetic payloads which in the future will be more likely to take over viralbased delivery systems,0
during the classical period in greece 6th 5th and 4th centuries bce and in hellenistic times natural philosophy developed along many lines of inquiry aristotle greek  aristotls 384322 bce a student of plato wrote on many subjects including a substantial treatise on physics  in the 4th century bc aristotelian physics was influential for about two millennia his approach mixed some limited observation with logical deductive arguments but did not rely on experimental verification of deduced statements aristotles foundational work in physics though very imperfect formed a framework against which later thinkers further developed the field his approach is entirely superseded today,0
within eukaryotes there exist structural features of chromatin that influence the transcription of genes often in the form of modifications to dna and chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells these features are called epigenetic because they exist on top of the dna sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to the next because of epigenetic features different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over the course of development some like the phenomenon of paramutation have multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule of dna as the basis for inheritance,0

proper cvd management necessitates a focus on mi and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate keeping in mind the costeffectiveness of any intervention especially in developing countries with low or middleincome levels regarding mi strategies using aspirin atenolol streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator have been compared for qualityadjusted lifeyear qaly in regions of low and middle income the costs for a single qaly for aspirin and atenolol were less than us25 streptokinase was about 680 and tpa was 16000 aspirin ace inhibitors betablockers and statins used together for secondary cvd prevention in the same regions showed single qaly costs of 350,0
imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography pet and magnetic resonance imaging mri are routinely used in oncology and neuroscience areas for example measurement of tumour shrinkage is a commonly used surrogate endpoint in solid tumour response evaluation this allows for faster and more objective assessment of the effects of anticancer drugs in alzheimers disease mri scans of the entire brain can accurately assess the rate of hippocampal atrophy while pet scans can measure the brains metabolic activity by measuring regional glucose metabolism and betaamyloid plaques using tracers such as pittsburgh compound b pib historically less use has been made of quantitative medical imaging in other areas of drug development although interest is growing,0
primary prevention consists of traditional health promotion and specific protection health promotion activities include prevention strategies such as health education and lifestyle medicine and are current nonclinical life choices such as eating nutritious meals and exercising often that prevent lifestylerelated medical conditions improve the quality of life and create a sense of overall wellbeing preventing disease and creating overall wellbeing prolongs life expectancy healthpromotional activities do not target a specific disease or condition but rather promote health and wellbeing on a very general level on the other hand specific protection targets a type or group of diseases and complements the goals of health promotion,0
reducedosmolarity ors is the current standard of care for oral rehydration therapy with reasonably wide availability introduced in 2003 by who and unicef reducedosmolarity solutions contain lower concentrations of sodium and glucose than original ors preparations reducedosmolarity ors has the added benefit of reducing stool volume and vomiting while simultaneously preventing dehydration packets of reducedosmolarity ors include glucose table salt potassium chloride and trisodium citrate for general use each packet should be mixed with a liter of water however for malnourished children experts recommend adding a packet of ors to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose and some stock potassium solution,0
there is a scientific consensus that available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food and a 2016 us national academy of sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of genetically modified foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies however there are concerns that genetically modified foods also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms could be responsible for allergic reactions and that the widespread acceptance of these types of foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies,0
in particular building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time when trying to outperform conventional computers quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers but this leaves the possibility that efficient nonquantum techniques will be developed in response as seen for quantum supremacy demonstrations therefore it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible nonquantum algorithms which may be unknown and show that some quantum algorithms asymptomatically improve upon those bounds,0
it is important for doctors to make meaningful connections and relationships with their patients instead of simply having interactions with them which often occurs in a system that relies heavily on specialist care for this reason behavioral medicine emphasizes honest and clear communication between the doctor and the patient in the successful treatment of any illness and also in the maintenance of an optimal level of physical and mental health obstacles to effective communication include power dynamics vulnerability and feelings of helplessness or fear doctors and other healthcare providers also struggle with interviewing difficult or uncooperative patients as well as giving undesirable medical news to patients and their families,0
dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing higherdimensional data eg 3d to a smaller space eg 2d the manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization,0
screening ecgs either at rest or with exercise are not recommended in those without symptoms who are at low risk this includes those who are young without risk factors in those at higher risk the evidence for screening with ecgs is inconclusive additionally echocardiography myocardial perfusion imaging and cardiac stress testing is not recommended in those at low risk who do not have symptoms some biomarkers may add to conventional cardiovascular risk factors in predicting the risk of future cardiovascular disease however the value of some biomarkers is questionable anklebrachial index abi highsensitivity creactive protein hscrp and coronary artery calcium are also of unclear benefit in those without symptoms as of 2018,0
in contrast cone cells are less sensitive to the overall intensity of light but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequencyranges and thus are used in the perception of colour and photopic vision cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells most night vision is limited to rod cells likewise since cone cells are in the fovea central vision including the vision needed to do most reading fine detail work such as sewing or careful examination of objects is done by cone cells,0
many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century with 2024 the warmest on record at 160 c 288 f since regular tracking began in 1850 additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about 28 c 50 f by the end of the century limiting warming to 15 c would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving netzero emissions by 2050,0
during adolescence the human body undergoes various physical physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones of which the most significant in females is 17estradiol an estrogen and in males is testosterone estradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later there is evidence that these steroids not only act directly on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system including an increased risk in developing pubescent and postpubescent autoimmunity there is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on b cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system,0
the bestknown role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism as well as manipulating dna in processes such as dna replication dna repair and transcription some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification about 4000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes the rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormousas much as 1017fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase 78 million years without the enzyme 18 milliseconds with the enzyme,0
by contrast bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials directly for interfacing with and utilizing living things bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues cells and molecules this can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals relatedly biomedical engineering is an overlapping field that often draws upon and applies biotechnology by various definitions especially in certain subfields of biomedical or chemical engineering such as tissue engineering biopharmaceutical engineering and genetic engineeringcitation needed,0

at rest the esophagus is closed at both ends by the upper and lower esophageal sphincters the opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex so that food is allowed through the sphincter also serves to prevent back flow from the esophagus into the pharynx the esophagus has a mucous membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the esophagus during swallowing food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position to direct the food into the esophagus and away from the trachea,0
in practice modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter dark energy and black holes whether or not time travel is possible wormholes can form or the multiverse exists and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include solar system formation and evolution stellar dynamics and evolution galaxy formation and evolution magnetohydrodynamics largescale structure of matter in the universe origin of cosmic rays general relativity and physical cosmology including string cosmology and astroparticle physicscitation needed,0
there is a range of approaches to assist victims to overcome the anxiety and stress that follows psychological trauma affected persons can also follow selfcare such as exercise and socializing with familiar and safe associates and family members trauma disturbs the bodys natural equilibrium by putting it in a state of fear and hyperarousal exercising for thirty minutes a day facilitated the nervous system to unfreeze from a traumatic state being surrounded by a good support system is a powerful factor in treating psychological trauma participating in social activities volunteering and making new friends are all ways to help forget about or cope with traumatic events coming to terms with childhood trauma is especially challengingcitation needed,0
in 1890 william james defined psychology as the science of mental life both of its phenomena and their conditions this definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades however this meaning was contested notably by john b watson who in 1913 asserted the methodological behaviorist view of psychology as a purely objective experimental branch of natural science the theoretical goal of which is the prediction and control of behavior since james defined psychology the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation folk psychology is the understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people held by ordinary people as contrasted with psychology professionals understanding,0
allergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure which usually manifests as hives the skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanutallergic individuals peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers notably the skin barrier are more prone to skin sensitization environmental factors such as exposure to food microorganisms creams and detergents may lead to skin barrier dysfunction several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization,0
some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical rather than chemical effects a prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma cancer of the serous membrane usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs other substances in this category including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestoslike fibers such as wollastonite attapulgite glass wool and rock wool are believed to have similar effects nonfibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica quartz cristobalite and tridymite usually physical carcinogens must get inside the body such as through inhalation and require years of exposure to produce cancer,0
there are different theories about what causes famine some theorists like the indian economist amartya sen believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population in this view malnutrition is caused by unequal distribution of resources and under or unused arable land for example sen argues that no matter how a famine is caused methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the public distribution system this applies not only to organizing rationing and control but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation,0
modern advances in personalized medicine rely on technology that confirms a patients fundamental biology dna rna or protein which ultimately leads to confirming disease for example personalised techniques such as genome sequencing can reveal mutations in dna that influence diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer another method called rnaseq can show which rna molecules are involved with specific diseases unlike dna levels of rna can change in response to the environment therefore sequencing rna can provide a broader understanding of a persons state of health recent studies have linked genetic differences between individuals to rna expression translation and protein levels,0
another area of research being explored is the use of genetically engineered animals for transplants similar to human organ donors scientists have developed a genetically engineered pig with the aim of reducing rejection to pig organs by human patients this is currently at the basic research stage but shows great promise in alleviating the long waiting lists for organ transplants and the number of people in need of transplants outweighs the amount of organs donated trials are being done to prevent the pig organ transplant to enter a clinical trial phase until the potential disease transfer from pigs to humans can be safely and satisfactorily managed isola  gordon 1991,0
the relationship between some gut microbiota and humans is not merely commensal a nonharmful coexistence but rather a mutualistic relationship 700 some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into shortchain fatty acids scfas such as acetic acid and butyric acid which are then absorbed by the host intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing certain b vitamins and vitamin k as well as metabolizing bile acids sterols and xenobiotics the systemic importance of the scfas and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions,0
common allergens include pollen and certain foods metals and other substances may also cause such problems food insect stings and medications are common causes of severe reactions their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors the underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin e antibodies ige part of the bodys immune system binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine diagnosis is typically based on a persons medical history further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases positive tests however may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question,0
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the socit de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the socit danthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in 1859n 4 when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature,0
psychologists such as hans eysenck and philosophers including karl popper sharply criticized psychoanalysis popper argued that psychoanalysis was not falsifiable no claim it made could be proven wrong and therefore inherently not a scientific discipline whereas eysenck advanced the view that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data by the end of the 20th century psychology departments in american universities mostly had marginalized freudian theory dismissing it as a desiccated and dead historical artifact researchers such as antnio damsio oliver sacks and joseph ledoux and individuals in the emerging field of neuropsychoanalysis have defended some of freuds ideas on scientific grounds,0
alex hershaft cofounder of the farm animal rights movement and holocaust survivor says he was always bothered by the idea of hitting a beautiful living innocent animal over the head cutting him up into pieces then shoving the pieces into his mouth and that his experiences in the nazi holocaust allowed him to empathize with the conditions of animals in factory farms auction yards and slaughterhouses because he knows firsthand what its like to be treated like a worthless object several animal rights activists including isaac bashevis singer gary yourofsky and karen davis have compared the cruel treatment of animals in cafos and slaughterhouses to the holocaust,0
in 2021 vegan climate activist greta thunberg called for more vegan food production and consumption worldwide parties like tierschutzpartei in germany and pacma in spain have provegan agendas they cooperate via animal politics eu in the european union meat producers and vegans debate whether vegan food products should be allowed to use terms like sausages or burgers the eu bans labeling vegan products with dairyrelated words like almond milk a rule instated in 2017 as of 2019update six countries in europe apply higher valueadded tax vat rates to vegan plant milk than to cow milk which provegan activists have called discrimination,0
many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction some proteins such as insulin are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell 25181,0
according to us and canadian dietary reference intake guidelines the protein recommended dietary allowance rda for adults is based on 08 grams protein per kilogram body weight the recommendation is for sedentary and lightly active people scientific reviews can conclude that a high protein diet when combined with exercise will increase muscle mass and strength or conclude the opposite the international olympic committee recommends protein intake targets for both strength and endurance athletes at about 1218 gkg body mass per day one review proposed a maximum daily protein intake of approximately 25 of energy requirements ie approximately 20 to 25 gkg,0
all of the solar systems planets have atmospheres this is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium close by while the smaller planets lose these gases into space the composition of the earths atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen much of mercurys atmosphere has been blasted away by the solar wind the only moon that has retained a dense atmosphere is titan there is a thin atmosphere on triton and a trace of an atmosphere on the moon,0
in the united states cancer is included as a protected condition by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc mainly due to the potential for cancer having discriminating effects on workers discrimination in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly and may ask for more sick leave than other employees employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on misconceptions about cancer disabilities if present the eeoc provides interview guidelines for employers as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and accommodating employees with cancer,0
a 2022 cochrane review of controlled trials did not find clear evidence that marinederived omega3 supplementation improves cognitive and physical recovery or social and emotional wellbeing following stroke diagnosis nor prevents stroke recurrence and mortality in this review mood appeared to worsen slightly among those receiving 3g fish oil supplementation for 12 weeks psychometric scores changed by 141 007 to 275 points less than those receiving palm and soy oil however this represented only a single small study and was not observed in a study lasting more than 3 months overall the review was limited by the small amount of highquality evidence available,0
studies of string theory have also yielded a number of results on the nature of black holes and the gravitational interaction there are certain paradoxes that arise when one attempts to understand the quantum aspects of black holes and work on string theory has attempted to clarify these issues in late 1997 this line of work culminated in the discovery of the antide sitterconformal field theory correspondence or adscft this is a theoretical result that relates string theory to other physical theories which are better understood theoretically the adscft correspondence has implications for the study of black holes and quantum gravity and it has been applied to other subjects including nuclear and condensed matter physics,0
james joyces 1922 novel ulysses is said to have vegetarian themes scholar peter adkins argued that while joyce was critical of the vegetarianism of george ae russell the novel engages with questions of animal ethics through its portrayal of irelands cattle industry animal slaughter and the cultural currency of meat unlike some of his other novels he also stated that the novel historicizes and theorizes animal life and death and that it demonstrates the ways that symbolism and materiality of meat are coopted within patriarchal political structures putting it in the same space as theorists like carol j adams donna j haraway laura wright and cary wolfe and writers such as j m coetzee,0

the day before admission to hospital the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal on admission only calorie and caffeinefree fluids are allowed until dinner which consists of eggnognote 9 restricted to onethird of the typical calories for a meal the following breakfast and lunch are similar and on the second day the eggnog dinner is increased to twothirds of a typical meals caloric content by the third day dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal not eggnog after a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day the patient is discharged where possible the patients current medicines are changed to carbohydratefree formulations,0
the concept of waves in epidemics has implications especially for communicable diseases a working definition for the term epidemic wave is based on two key features 1 it comprises periods of upward or downward trends and 2 these increases or decreases must be substantial and sustained over a period of time in order to distinguish them from minor fluctuations or reporting errors the use of a consistent scientific definition is to provide a consistent language that can be used to communicate about and understand the progression of the covid19 pandemic which would aid healthcare organizations and policymakers in resource planning and allocation,0
the who estimates that diabetes resulted in 15 million deaths in 2012 making it the 8th leading cause of death however another 22 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of cardiovascular disease and other associated complications eg kidney failure which often lead to premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes for example in 2017 the international diabetes federation idf estimated that diabetes resulted in 40 million deaths worldwide using modeling to estimate the total number of deaths that could be directly or indirectly attributed to diabetes,0
streams within a number of religious traditions encourage veganism sometimes on ethical or environmental grounds scholars have especially noted the growth in the 21st century of jewish veganism as well as jain veganism some religious interpretations such as christian vegetarianism hindu vegetarianism and buddhist vegetarianism also recommend or mandate a vegan diet donald watson argued if jesus were alive today hed be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days spreading the message of compassion which as i see it is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and sad as it seems i doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the vegan society,0
people who have no access to commercially available ors can make a homemade version using water sugar and table salt experts agree that homemade ors preparations should include one liter 34 oz of clean water and 6 teaspoons of sugar however they disagree about whether they should contain half a teaspoon of table salt or a full teaspoon most sources recommend using half a teaspoon of salt per liter of water however people with malnutrition have an excess of body sodium to avoid worsening this symptom ors for people with severe undernutrition should contain half the usual amount of sodium and more potassium,0
neuroplasticity is involved in the development of sensory function the brain is born immature and then adapts to sensory inputs after birth in the auditory system congenital hearing loss a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns has been shown to affect auditory development and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the auditory system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the auditory system due to a sensitive period for plasticity there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 24 years of life consequently in prelingually deaf children early cochlear implantation as a rule allows the children to learn the mother language and acquire acoustic communication,0
techniques like hand washing wearing gowns and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another aseptic technique was introduced in medicine and surgery in the late 19th century and greatly reduced the incidence of infections caused by surgery frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms there are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs using a condom wearing gloves and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also importantcitation needed,0
bosons are the mediators or carriers of fundamental interactions such as electromagnetism the weak interaction and the strong interaction electromagnetism is mediated by the photon the quanta of light 2930 the weak interaction is mediated by the w and z bosons the strong interaction is mediated by the gluon which can link quarks together to form composite particles due to the aforementioned color confinement gluons are never observed independently the higgs boson gives mass to the w and z bosons via the higgs mechanism  the gluon and photon are expected to be massless all bosons have an integer quantum spin 0 and 1 and can have the same quantum state,0
short proteins can be synthesized chemically by a family of peptide synthesis methods these rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of nonnatural amino acids into polypeptide chains such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains these methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology though generally not for commercial applications chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure most chemical synthesis methods proceed from cterminus to nterminus opposite the biological reaction,0
in the original 1902 definition by bayliss and starling see below they specified that to be classified as a hormone a chemical must be produced by an organ be released in small amounts into the blood and be transported by the blood to a distant organ to exert its specific function this definition holds for most classical hormones but there are also paracrine mechanisms chemical communication between cells within a tissue or organ autocrine signals a chemical that acts on the same cell and intracrine signals a chemical that acts within the same cell a neuroendocrine signal is a classical hormone that is released into the blood by a neurosecretory neuron see article on neuroendocrinologycitation needed,0
nutrient deficiencies known as malnutrition occur when an organism does not have the nutrients that it needs this may be caused by suddenly losing nutrients or the inability to absorb proper nutrients not only is malnutrition the result of a lack of necessary nutrients but it can also be a result of other illnesses and health conditions when this occurs an organism will adapt by reducing energy consumption and expenditure to prolong the use of stored nutrients it will use stored energy reserves until they are depleted and it will then break down its own body mass for additional energy,0
metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules this common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions these grouptransfer intermediates are called coenzymes each class of grouptransfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it and a set of enzymes that consume it these coenzymes are therefore continuously made consumed and then recycled,0
the idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by histone methylation as well methylation of lysine 9 of histone h3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin constitutive heterochromatin see bottom figure it has been determined that a chromodomain a domain that specifically binds methyllysine in the transcriptionally repressive protein hp1 recruits hp1 to k9 methylated regions one example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with and required for full transcriptional activation see top figure trimethylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail,0
in these cyclic forms the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms these forms are called furanoses and pyranoses respectivelyby analogy with furan and pyran the simplest compounds with the same carbonoxygen ring although they lack the carboncarbon double bonds of these two molecules for example the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4 yielding a molecule with a 5membered ring called glucofuranose the same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6membered ring called glucopyranose cyclic forms with a 7atom ring called heptoses are rarecitation needed,0
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies,0

in 1920 rettger and cheplin reported that metchnikoffs bulgarian bacillus later called lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus could not live in the human intestinenonprimary source needed they conducted experiments involving rats and humans volunteers feeding them with lactobacillus acidophilus they observed the disappearance of the pathogenic protist balantidium coli as well as of other gasproducing bacteria rettger further explored the possibilities of l acidophilus and reasoned that bacteria originating from the gut were more likely to produce the desired effect in this environment in 1935 certain strains of l acidophilus were found very active when implanted in the human digestive tractnonprimary source needed,0
the important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction pcr the rise of molecular technologies and the influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication molecular ecology in 1992 molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context in 1994 john avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book molecular markers natural history and evolution,0
without gut flora the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes because some types of gut flora have enzymes that human cells lack for breaking down certain polysaccharides rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30 more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches fiber oligosaccharides and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols mucus produced by the gut and proteins,0
in japan in 675 the emperor tenmu prohibited the killing and the eating of meat during the busy farming period between april and september but excluded the eating of wild birds and wild animals these bans and several others that followed over the centuries were overturned in the nineteenth century during the meiji restoration in china during the song dynasty buddhist cuisine became popular enough that vegetarian restaurants appeared where chefs used ingredients such as beans gluten root vegetables and mushrooms to create meat analogues including pork fowl eggs and crab roe and many meat substitutes used even today such as tofu seitan and konjac originate in chinese buddhist cuisine,0
polyphenols are a large diverse group of compounds making it difficult to determine their biological effects they are not considered nutrients as they are not used for growth survival or reproduction nor do they provide dietary energy therefore they do not have recommended daily intake levels as exist for vitamins minerals and fiber in the united states the food and drug administration issued guidance to manufacturers that polyphenols cannot be mentioned on food labels as antioxidant nutrients unless physiological evidence exists to verify such a qualification and a dietary reference intake value has been established  characteristics which have not been determined for polyphenols,0
information from epidemiology toxicology and exposure science can be combined to conduct a risk assessment for specific chemicals mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health exposure would likely result in the development of pollutionrelated diseases this can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that for example regulates chemical emissions or imposes standards for proper sanitation actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide risk management to minimize monitor and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy,0
structural plasticity is often understood as the brains ability to change its neuronal connections new neurons are constantly produced and integrated into the central nervous system throughout the life span based on this type of neuroplasticity researchers nowadays use multiple crosssectional imaging methods ie magnetic resonance imaging mri computerized tomography ct to study the structural alterations of the human brains this type of neuroplasticity often studies the effect of various internal or external stimuli on the brains anatomical reorganization the changes of grey matter proportion or the synaptic strength in the brain are considered as examples of structural neuroplasticity structural neuroplasticity is currently investigated more within the field of neuroscience in current academia,0
insomnia is a general term for difficulty falling asleep andor staying asleep insomnia is the most common sleep problem with many adults reporting occasional insomnia and 1015 reporting a chronic condition insomnia can have many different causes including psychological stress a poor sleep environment an inconsistent sleep schedule or excessive mental or physical stimulation in the hours before bedtime insomnia is often treated through behavioral changes like keeping a regular sleep schedule avoiding stimulating or stressful activities before bedtime and cutting down on stimulants such as caffeine the sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes to shut out all sunlight and keeping computers televisions and work materials out of the sleeping area,0
in 2012 barbara nattersonhorowitz a physician and kathryn bowers a science journalist published the book zoobiquity coining the term as they drew parallels between animal and human health through vivid case studies they called for the biomedical scientific and clinical communities to rediscover comparative medicine and reexamine human and animal health in terms of evolution and the environment a new york times bestseller the book has been described as easy to read and entertaining in its presentation of ideas similar to the one health concept but also criticized as lacking depth and failing to recognize the extent to which animals and humans have differently evolved as complex systems,0
other types of infection consist of mixed iatrogenic nosocomial and communityacquired infection a mixed infection is an infection that is caused by two or more pathogens an example of this is appendicitis which is caused by bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli the second is an iatrogenic infection this type of infection is one that is transmitted from a health care worker to a patient a nosocomial infection is also one that occurs in a health care setting nosocomial infections are those that are acquired during a hospital stay lastly a communityacquired infection is one in which the infection is acquired from a whole community,0
the immune system particularly the innate component plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult key actors include macrophages and neutrophils but other cellular actors including  t cells innate lymphoid cells ilcs and regulatory t cells tregs are also important the plasticity of immune cells and the balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well for example in amphibians such as in axolotl limb regeneration according to one hypothesis organisms that can regenerate eg axolotls could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot regenerate,0
reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hypochlorous acid hclo and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical oh and the superoxide anion o2 the hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and nonspecifically with most biological molecules this species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metalcatalyzed redox reactions such as the fenton reaction these oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation or by oxidizing dna or proteins damage to dna can cause mutations and possibly cancer if not reversed by dna repair mechanisms while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition denaturation and protein degradation,0
telehealth projects underway before and during the 1980s would take off but fail to enter mainstream healthcare as a result this period of telehealth history is called the maturation stage and made way for sustainable growth although state funding in north america was beginning to run low different hospitals began to launch their own telehealth initiatives nasa provided an ats3 satellite to enable medical care communications of american red cross and pan american health organization response teams following the 1985 mexico city earthquake the agency then launched its satelifehealthnet programme to increase health service connectivity in developing countries in 1997 nasa sponsored yales medical informatics and technology applications consortium project,0
ai gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by 2000 solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the 1990s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around 2002 they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the 2010s,0
historically public health campaigns have been criticized as a form of healthism as moralistic in nature rather than being focused on health medical doctors petr shkrabanek and james mccormick wrote a series of publications on this topic in the late 1980s and early 1990s criticizing the uks the health of the nation campaign these publications exposed abuse of epidemiology and statistics by the public health movement to support lifestyle interventions and screening programs 85 a combination of inculcating a fear of illhealth and a strong notion of individual responsibility has been criticized as a form of health fascism by a number of scholars objectifying the individual with no considerations of emotional or social factors 8  7  81,0
six other amino acids are considered conditionally essential in the human diet meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress these six are arginine cysteine glycine glutamine proline and tyrosine six amino acids are nonessential dispensable in humans meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body these six are alanine aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid serine and selenocysteine considered the 21st amino acid pyrrolysine considered the 22nd amino acid which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms is not used by and therefore nonessential for most organisms including humans,0
a later document in the timeline of global initiatives for malnutrition was the 1996 rome declaration on world food security organized by the food and agriculture organization this document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritious food by everyone also considering that everyone gets sufficient food and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halving their number of undernourished people by 2015 in 2004 the food and agriculture organization adopted the right to food guidelines which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis,0
overnutrition caused by overeating is also a form of malnutrition in the united states more than half of all adults are now overweighta condition that like hunger increases susceptibility to disease and disability reduces worker productivity and lowers life expectancy overeating is much more common in the united states since most people have adequate access to food many parts of the world have access to a surplus of nonnutritious food increased sedentary lifestyles also contribute to overnutrition yale university psychologist kelly brownell calls this a toxic food environment where fat and sugarladen foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods,0
the mechanical properties of proteins are highly diverse and are often central to their biological function as in the case of proteins like keratin and collagen for instance the ability of muscle tissue to continually expand and contract is directly tied to the elastic properties of their underlying protein makeup beyond fibrous proteins the conformational dynamics of enzymes and the structure of biological membranes among other biological functions are governed by the mechanical properties of the proteins outside of their biological context the unique mechanical properties of many proteins along with their relative sustainability when compared to synthetic polymers have made them desirable targets for nextgeneration materials design,0
this system enabled wireless transmission of ecg from the moving icu van or the patients home to the central station in icu of the department of medicine transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise transmission was also done through telephone lines the ecg output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ecg into high frequency sound at the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ecg with a good gain accuracy the ecg was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500 hz to 2500 hz with 1500 hz at baseline,0
diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10000 times slower in water than in air when soils are flooded they quickly lose oxygen becoming hypoxic an environment with o2 concentration below 2 mgliter and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive compete and diversify in these environments for example their roots and stems contain large air spaces aerenchyma that regulate the efficient transportation of gases for example co2 and o2 used in respiration and photosynthesis,0
the united nations environment programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the paris agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2 c an even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 15 c goal with pledges made under the paris agreement as of 2024 there would be a 66 chance that global warming is kept under 28 c by the end of the century range 1937 c depending on exact implementation and technological progress when only considering current policies this raises to 31 c globally limiting warming to 2 c may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs,0
physicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency or they might elect to complete a postresidency fellowship this field encompasses the complex diseases of the neonates hereditary skin diseases or genodermatoses and the many difficulties of working with the pediatric population another area pediatric dermatologists may focus on is treating acne acne is formed when follicles under the skin become clogged this can be caused by sebum an oil that keeps the skin moist or dead skin cells clogging the pores this is very common in teens and young adults and can be treated by prescription from a dermatologist,0
breastfeeding is noted as one of the most costeffective medical interventions benefiting child health while there are considerable differences among developed and developing countries there are universal determinants of whether a mother breastfeeds or uses formula these include income employment social norms and access to healthcare many newly made mothers face financial barriers communitybased healthcare workers have helped to alleviate these barriers while also providing a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospitalbased medical care recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995 to 2010 show that exclusive breastfeeding rates have risen globally from 33 to 39 despite the growth rates medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding,0
the standard model as currently formulated has 61 elementary particles those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s the standard model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date however most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery see theory of everything in recent years measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the standard model since neutrinos do not have mass in the standard model,0
ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms the communities they make up and the nonliving abiotic components of their environment ecosystem processes such as primary production nutrient cycling and niche construction regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment ecosystems have biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living biotic and abiotic components of the planet ecosystems sustain lifesupporting functions and provide ecosystem services like biomass production food fuel fiber and medicine the regulation of climate global biogeochemical cycles water filtration soil formation erosion control flood protection and many other natural features of scientific historical economic or intrinsic value,0
several barriers protect organisms from infection including mechanical chemical and biological barriers the waxy cuticle of most leaves the exoskeleton of insects the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments so systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs intestines and the genitourinary tract in the lungs coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms,0
training in internal medicine as opposed to surgical training varies considerably across the world see the articles on medical education for more details in north america it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school which can then be followed by a one to threeyear fellowship in the subspecialties listed above in general resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery averaging about 60 hours per week in the us this difference does not apply in the uk where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average,0
the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks as organisms exist during the same period throughout the world their presence or sometimes absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear based on principles that william smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwins theory of evolution the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought the principle becomes quite complex however given the uncertainties of fossilization localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat facies change in sedimentary strata and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time,0
much proteomics data is collected with the help of high throughput technologies such as mass spectrometry and microarray it would often take weeks or months to analyze the data and perform comparisons by hand for this reason biologists and chemists are collaborating with computer scientists and mathematicians to create programs and pipeline to computationally analyze the protein data using bioinformatics techniques researchers are capable of faster analysis and data storage a good place to find lists of current programs and databases is on the expasy bioinformatics resource portal the applications of bioinformaticsbased proteomics include medicine disease diagnosis biomarker identification and many more,0
these developments as well as the results from embryology and paleontology were synthesized in the 1859 publication of charles darwins theory of evolution by natural selection in this darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing by explaining the processes by which it can occur and providing observational evidence that it had done so darwins theory was rapidly accepted by the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology the basis for modern genetics began with the work of gregor mendel on peas in 1865 although the significance of his work was not realized at the time,0
sleep is divided into two broad types nonrapid eye movement nonrem or nrem sleep and rapid eye movement rem sleep nonrem and rem sleep are so different that physiologists identify them as distinct behavioral states nonrem sleep occurs first and after a transitional period is called slowwave sleep or deep sleep during this phase body temperature and heart rate fall and the brain uses less energy rem sleep also known as paradoxical sleep represents a smaller portion of total sleep time it is the main occasion for dreams or nightmares and is associated with desynchronized and fast brain waves eye movements loss of muscle tone and suspension of homeostasis,0
the starting point for string theory is the idea that the pointlike particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as onedimensional objects called strings the interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory at the level of feynman diagrams this means replacing the onedimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a twodimensional 2d surface representing the motion of a string unlike in quantum field theory string theory does not have a full nonperturbative definition so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach,0
an organism whose circadian clock exhibits a regular rhythm corresponding to outside signals is said to be entrained an entrained rhythm persists even if the outside signals suddenly disappear if an entrained human is isolated in a bunker with constant light or darkness he or she will continue to experience rhythmic increases and decreases of body temperature and melatonin on a period that slightly exceeds 24 hours scientists refer to such conditions as freerunning of the circadian rhythm under natural conditions light signals regularly adjust this period downward so that it corresponds better with the exact 24 hours of an earth day,0
in 1992 claudio bordignon working at the vitasalute san raffaele university performed the first gene therapy procedure using hematopoietic stem cells as vectors to deliver genes intended to correct hereditary diseases in 2002 this work led to the publication of the first successful gene therapy treatment for adascid the success of a multicenter trial for treating children with scid severe combined immune deficiency or bubble boy disease from 2000 and 2002 was questioned when two of the ten children treated at the trials paris center developed a leukemialike condition clinical trials were halted temporarily in 2002 but resumed after regulatory review of the protocol in the us the united kingdom france italy and germany,0

these services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional inperson patient encounters supply greater satisfaction to patients and may be costeffective telerehabilitation or erehabilitation is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunications networks and the internet most types of services fall into two categories clinical assessment the patients functional abilities in his or her environment and clinical therapy some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are neuropsychology speechlanguage pathology audiology occupational therapy and physical therapy telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a clinic because the patient has a disability or because of travel time telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance,0
monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics the placement of its carbonyl group the number of carbon atoms it contains and its chiral handedness if the carbonyl group is an aldehyde the monosaccharide is an aldose if the carbonyl group is a ketone the monosaccharide is a ketose monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses those with four are called tetroses five are called pentoses six are hexoses and so on these two systems of classification are often combined for example glucose is an aldohexose a sixcarbon aldehyde ribose is an aldopentose a fivecarbon aldehyde and fructose is a ketohexose a sixcarbon ketone,0
while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of ai for machine learnings vulnerability to biases in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association cra in 2021 female faculty merely make up 161 of all faculty members who focus on ai among several universities around the world furthermore among the group of new us resident ai phd graduates 45 identified as white 224 as asian 32 as hispanic and 24 as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai,0
applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science it accesses and uses the research communities accumulated theories knowledge methods and techniques for a specific often stated business or clientdriven purpose translational research forms a subset of applied research in lifesciences this was evidenced by a citation pattern between the applied and basic sides in cancer research that appeared around 2000 in fields such as psychology translational research is seen as a bridging between applied research and basic research types the field of psychology defines translational research as the use of basic research to develop and test applications such as treatment,0
an important element for the skeletons of marine animals is calcium but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below the carbonate compensation depth calcium carbonate becomes more soluble at lower ph so ocean acidification is likely to affect marine organisms with calcareous shells such as oysters clams sea urchins and corals and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface affected planktonic organisms will include pteropods coccolithophorids and foraminifera all important in the food chain in tropical regions corals are likely to be severely affected as they become less able to build their calcium carbonate skeletons in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers,0
mental health is a socially constructed concept different societies groups cultures both ethnic and nationalregional institutions and professions have very different ways of conceptualizing its nature and causes determining what is mentally healthy and deciding what interventions if any are appropriate thus different professionals will have different cultural class political and religious backgrounds which will impact the methodology applied during treatment in the context of deaf mental health care it is necessary for professionals to have cultural competency of deaf and hard of hearing people and to understand how to properly rely on trained qualified and certified interpreters when working with culturally deaf clients,0
in 2016 the commission on a global health risk framework for the future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over 6 trillion in the 21st centuryover 60 billion per year the same report recommended spending 45 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events a figure that the world bank group raised to 13 billion in a 2019 report it has been suggested that such costs be paid from a tax on aviation rather than from eg income taxes given the crucial role of air traffic in transforming local epidemics into pandemics being the only factor considered in stateoftheart models of longrange disease transmission ,0
"three omega3 fatty acids are important in human physiology linolenic acid 183 n3 ala eicosapentaenoic acid 205 n3 epa and docosahexaenoic acid 226 n3 dha these three polyunsaturates have either 3 5 or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18 20 or 22 carbon atoms respectively as with most naturallyproduced fatty acids all double bonds are in the cisconfiguration in other words the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond and the double bonds are interrupted by methylene bridges (-ch2-), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent double bonds.",0
geology describes the structure of the earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location geochemistry a branch of geology determines their absolute ages by combining various petrological crystallographic and paleontological tools geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the earth as a whole one aspect is to demonstrate the age of the earth geology provides evidence for plate tectonics the evolutionary history of life and the earths past climates,0
a chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves atoms as subjects the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal when the number of atoms on either side is unequal the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules known as chemical laws,0
david pearce a transhumanist philosopher has argued that humanity has a hedonistic imperative not merely to avoid cruelty to animals caused by humans but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering in nature ceases to exist in pursuit of abolishing suffering pearce promotes predation elimination among animals and the crossspecies global analogue of the welfare state fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine predation and disease the increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to pearces influence,0
most physical phenomena are modeled by partial differential equations to solve them one usually decomposes the space in which the solutions are searched into small mutually interacting cells for linear systems this interaction involves linear functions for nonlinear systems this interaction is often approximated by linear functionsbthis is called a linear model or firstorder approximation linear models are frequently used for complex nonlinear realworld systems because they make parametrization more manageable in both cases very large matrices are generally involved weather forecasting or more specifically parametrization for atmospheric modeling is a typical example of a realworld application where the whole earth atmosphere is divided into cells of say 100 km of width and 100 km of height,0
the modified gene therapy strategy of antisense igfi rna nih n 1602 using antisense  triple helix antiigfi approach was registered in 2002 by wiley gene therapy clinical trial  n 635 and 636 the approach has shown promising results in the treatment of six different malignant tumors glioblastoma cancers of liver colon prostate uterus and ovary collaborative nato science programme on gene therapy usa france poland n lst 980517 conducted by j trojan trojan et al 2012 this antigene antisensetriple helix therapy has proven to be efficient due to the mechanism stopping simultaneously igfi expression on translation and transcription levels strengthening antitumor immune and apoptotic phenomena,0
arthroplasty is an orthopedic surgery where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced remodeled or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure it is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis rheumasurgery or some other type of trauma as well as the standard total knee replacement surgery the unicompartmental knee replacement in which only one weightbearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced may be performed but it bears a significant risk of revision surgery joint replacements are used for other joints most commonly the hip or shoulder,0
in alignment with the lcogs call for action the world health assembly adopted the resolution wha6815 in 2015 that stated strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anesthesia as a component of universal health coverage this not only mandated the who to prioritize strengthening the surgical and anesthesia care globally but also led to governments of the member states recognizing the urgent need for increasing capacity in surgery and anesthesia additionally the third edition of disease control priorities dcp3 published in 2015 by the world bank declared surgery as essential and featured an entire volume dedicated to building surgical capacity,0
in neutrino astronomy astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as sage gallex and kamioka iiiii for the detection of neutrinos the vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the earth originate from the sun but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987a cosmic rays which consist of very high energy particles atomic nuclei that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the earths atmosphere result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the earths atmosphere,0
a 2015 study determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction with speciesrich habitats converted to agriculture for livestock production a 2017 world wildlife fund study found that 60 of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals which puts enormous strain on natural resources resulting in extensive loss of lands and species in 2017 15364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for among other things promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plantbased foods,0
glycemic load of a 100 g serving of food can be calculated as its carbohydrate content measured in grams g multiplied by the foods gi and divided by 100 for example watermelon has a gi of 72 a 100 g serving of watermelon has 5 g of available carbohydrates it contains a lot of water making the calculation 5  7210036 so the gl is 36 a food with a gi of 90 and 8 g of available carbohydrates has a gl of 72 8  9010072 while a food with a gi of just 6 and with 120 g of carbohydrate also has a gl of 72 120  610072.[citation needed],0
at the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms in 1897 jj thomson of the university of cambridge discovered the electron and soon after the french scientist becquerel as well as the couple pierre and marie curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity in a series of pioneering scattering experiments ernest rutherford at the university of manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles,0
there is frequently a reciprocal relationship between dna methylation and histone lysine methylation for instance the methyl binding domain protein mbd1 attracted to and associating with methylated cytosine in a dna cpg site can also associate with h3k9 methyltransferase activity to methylate histone 3 at lysine 9 on the other hand dna maintenance methylation by dnmt1 appears to partly rely on recognition of histone methylation on the nucleosome present at the dna site to carry out cytosine methylation on newly synthesized dna there is further crosstalk between dna methylation carried out by dnmt3a and dnmt3b and histone methylation so that there is a correlation between the genomewide distribution of dna methylation and histone methylation,0
in general relativity a black hole is defined as a region of spacetime in which the gravitational field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape in the currently accepted models of stellar evolution black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo gravitational collapse and many galaxies are thought to contain supermassive black holes at their centers black holes are also important for theoretical reasons as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity string theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their thermodynamics,0
the endocannabinoid system appears to play a significant role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery the endocannabinoidinduced modulation of stressrelated behaviors appears to be mediated at least in part through the regulation of the serotoninergic system by which cannabinoid cb1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic unpredictable stress cus on cb1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not,0
as interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century the field of occupational health psychology ohp emerged ohp is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary ohp is concerned with the health and safety of workers ohp addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health mistreatment of workers eg bullying and violence workfamily balance the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents and interventions designed to improveprotect worker health ohp grew out of health psychology industrial and organizational psychology and occupational medicine ohp has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology including industrial engineering sociology and economics,0
the increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research among the major benefits of medical research have been vaccines for measles and polio insulin treatment for diabetes classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies medication for high blood pressure improved treatments for aids statins and other treatments for atherosclerosis new surgical techniques such as microsurgery and increasingly successful treatments for cancer new beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the human genome project many challenges remain however including the appearance of antibiotic resistance and the obesity epidemiccitation needed,0
the ketogenic diet is not considered a benign holistic or allnatural treatment as with any serious medical therapy it may result in complications although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery common but easily treatable shortterm side effects include constipation lowgrade acidosis and hypoglycaemia if an initial fast is undertaken raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60 of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30 this can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats and if persistent by lowering the ketogenic ratio supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients,0
the probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points for an arbitrarily long distance the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated for genes that are closer together however the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together the amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear linkage map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome,0
the roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity the palate is hard at the front of the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone it is softer and more pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue and it can move to swallow food and liquids the soft palate ends at the uvula the surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food to leave the nasal passage clear the opening between the lips is termed the oral fissure and the opening into the throat is called the fauces,0
uric acid has the highest concentration of any blood antioxidant and provides over half of the total antioxidant capacity of human serum uric acids antioxidant activities are also complex given that it does not react with some oxidants such as superoxide but does act against peroxynitrite peroxides and hypochlorous acid concerns over elevated uas contribution to gout must be considered one of many risk factors by itself uarelated risk of gout at high levels 415530 moll is only 05 per year with an increase to 45 per year at ua supersaturation levels 535 moll many of these aforementioned studies determined uas antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 moll,0
"in the middle east hasan ibn alhaytham latinized as alhazen c 965  c 1040 ad derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers he determined the equations to calculate the area enclosed by the curve represented by y  x k displaystyle yxk which translates to the integral  x k d x displaystyle int xkdx in contemporary notation for any given nonnegative integer value of k displaystyle k .he used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration of this function, where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.",0
feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the patriarchal origins of anthropology and academia and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85 more than 81 were under 35 and only 72 to anyone over 40 years old thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by firstwave feminists until later in life this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory history linguistics archaeology and anthropology feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexismcitation needed,0
characterizing the human plasma proteome has become a major goal in the proteomics arena but it is also the most challenging proteomes of all human tissues it contains immunoglobulin cytokines protein hormones and secreted proteins indicative of infection on top of resident hemostatic proteins it also contains tissue leakage proteins due to the blood circulation through different tissues in the body the blood thus contains information on the physiological state of all tissues and combined with its accessibility makes the blood proteome invaluable for medical purposes it is thought that characterizing the proteome of blood plasma is a daunting challenge,0
a fundamental innovation was the ancient greeks introduction of the concept of proofs which require that every assertion must be proved for example it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that say two lengths are equal their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results theorems and a few basic statements the basic statements are not subject to proof because they are selfevident postulates or are part of the definition of the subject of study axioms this principle foundational for all mathematics was first elaborated for geometry and was systematized by euclid around 300 bc in his book elements,0
the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory where each pathogen is remembered by a signature antigen the adaptive immune response is antigenspecific and requires the recognition of specific nonself antigens during a process called antigen presentation antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogeninfected cells the ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by memory cells should a pathogen infect the body more than once these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it,0
access to health care may vary across countries communities and individuals influenced by social and economic conditions and health policies providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations such as insurance coverage geographical and logistical barriers such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services sociocultural expectations and personal limitations lack of ability to communicate with health care providers poor health literacy low income limitations to health care services affect negatively the use of medical services the efficacy of treatments and overall outcome wellbeing mortality rates,0
"the word mellitus mlats or mlts comes from the classical latin word melltus meaning mellite ie sweetened with honey honeysweet the latin word comes from mell which comes from mel meaning honey sweetness pleasant thing and the suffix tus whose meaning is the same as that of the english suffix ite it was thomas willis who in 1675 added mellitus to the word ""diabetes"" as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a person with diabetes had a sweet taste (glycosuria). this sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient greeks, chinese, egyptians, and indians.",0
various groups within christianity have practiced specific dietary restrictions for various reasons the council of jerusalem in around 50 ad recommended christians keep following some of the jewish food laws concerning meat the early sect known as the ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism surviving fragments from their gospel indicate their belief that  as christ is the passover sacrifice and eating the passover lamb is no longer required  a vegetarian diet may or should be observed however orthodox christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic indeed their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the ebionites errors,0
a semiconductor is a material that has a resistivity between a conductor and insulator modern day electronics run on semiconductors and the industry had an estimated us530 billion market in 2021 its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities in a process referred to as doping semiconductor materials are used to build diodes transistors lightemitting diodes leds and analog and digital electric circuits among their many uses semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices like vacuum tubes in most applications semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as integrated circuits ics which consist of a numberfrom a few to millionsof devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate,0
surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas for example a perforated ear drum surgeons must also manage preoperative postoperative and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards in some centers anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery for historical and logistical reasons although it is not a surgical discipline other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures such as ophthalmology and dermatology but are not considered surgical subspecialties per se,0
additionally the world bank and some wealthy donor countries have pressured developing countries to use free market policies even as the united states and europe extensively subsidized their own farmers they urged developing countries to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs like fertilizer without subsidies few if any farmers in developing countries can afford fertilizer at market prices this leads to low agricultural production low wages and high unaffordable food prices fertilizer is also increasingly unavailable because western environmental groups have fought to end its use due to environmental concerns the green revolution pioneers norman borlaug and keith rosenberg cited as the obstacle to feeding africa by ,0
macromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers monomers include sugars amino acids and nucleotides carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers they include steroids phospholipids and fats largely nonpolar and hydrophobic waterrepelling substances proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules they include enzymes transport proteins large signaling molecules antibodies and structural proteins the basic unit or monomer of a protein is an amino acid twenty amino acids are used in proteins nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides their function is to store transmit and express hereditary information,0
undernutrition most commonly results from a lack of access to highquality nutritious food the household income is a socioeconomic variable that influences the access to nutritious food and the probability of under and overnutrition in a community in the study by ghattas et al 2020 the probability of overnutrition is significantly higher in higherincome families than in disadvantaged families high food prices is a major factor preventing low income households from getting nutritious food for example khan and kraemer 2009 found that in bangladesh low socioeconomic status was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibited purchase of nutritious foods like milk meat poultry and fruits,0
parasitic worms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies recent research has shown that some common parasites such as intestinal worms eg hookworms secrete chemicals into the gut wall and hence the bloodstream that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite this gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theorythat coevolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites without them the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive,0
a major flaw and vulnerability in biomedical research appears to be the hypercompetition for the resources and positions that are required to conduct science the competition seems to suppress the creativity cooperation risktaking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries other consequences of todays highly pressured environment for research appear to be a substantial number of research publications whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives in research funding that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities other risky trends include a decline in the share of key research grants going to younger scientists as well as a steady rise in the age at which investigators receive their first funding,0
the term biosecurity has been defined differently by various disciplines the term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities to describe preventative measures against threats from naturally occurring diseases and pests later expanded to introduced species australia and new zealand among other countries had incorporated this definition within their legislation by 2010 new zealand was the earliest adopter of a comprehensive approach with its biosecurity act 1993 in 2001 the us national association of state departments of agriculture nasda defined biosecurity as the sum of risk management practices in defense against biological threats and its main goal as protecting against the risk posed by disease and organisms,0
in 1971 pierre ramond added fermions to the model which led him to formulate a twodimensional supersymmetry to cancel the wrongsign states john schwarz and andr neveu added another sector to the fermi theory a short time later in the fermion theories the critical dimension was 10 stanley mandelstam formulated a world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi case giving a twodimensional field theoretic pathintegral to generate the operator formalism michio kaku and keiji kikkawa gave a different formulation of the bosonic string as a string field theory with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not on points but on loops and curves,0
the views of niels bohr werner heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the copenhagen interpretation according to these views the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of causality bohr in particular emphasized that any welldefined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations copenhagentype interpretations were adopted by nobel laureates in quantum physics including bohr heisenberg schrdinger feynman and zeilinger as well as 21stcentury researchers in quantum foundations,0
specifics of training differs from program to program but all residents must obtain the same fundamental skills residents are trained in the inpatient setting to take care of multiple types of rehabilitation including spinal cord injury traumatic brain injury stroke orthopedic injuries cancer cerebral palsy burn pediatric rehab and other disabling injuries the residents are also trained in the outpatient setting to know how to take care of the chronic conditions patients have following their inpatient stay during training residents are instructed on how to properly perform several diagnostic procedures which include electromyography nerve conduction studies and also procedures such as joint injections and trigger point injections,0
following on from jenners work the second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by louis pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige national vaccination policies were adopted and compulsory vaccination laws were passed in 1931 alice miles woodruff and ernest goodpasture documented that the fowlpox virus could be grown in embryonated chicken egg soon scientists began cultivating other viruses in eggs eggs were used for virus propagation in the development of a yellow fever vaccine in 1935 and an influenza vaccine in 1945 in 1959 growth media and cell culture replaced eggs as the standard method of virus propagation for vaccines,0
a trophic level from greek troph  troph meaning food or feeding is a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level according to ecological pyramids nearer the abiotic source 383 links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or trophism among species biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance or biomass at each level when the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level they naturally sort into a pyramid of numbers,0
"the most common fatty acids in human diet are unsaturated or monounsaturated monounsaturated fats are found in animal flesh such as red meat whole milk products nuts and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados olive oil is about 75 monounsaturated fat the high oleic variety sunflower oil contains at least 70 monounsaturated fat canola oil and cashews are both about 58 monounsaturated fat tallow beef fat is about 50 monounsaturated fat and lard is about 40 monounsaturated fat other sources include hazelnut avocado oil macadamia nut oil grapeseed oil groundnut oil peanut oil sesame oil corn oil popcorn whole grain wheat cereal oatmeal almond oil hemp oil, and tea-oil camellia.",0
lastly temporal networks enable a better understanding and controlling of the spread of infectious diseases unlike traditional static networks which assume continuous unchanging connections temporal networks account for the precise timing and duration of interactions between individuals this dynamic approach reveals critical nuances such as how diseases can spread via timesensitive pathways that static models miss temporal data such as interactions captured through bluetooth sensors or in hospital wards can improve predictions of outbreak speed and extent overlooking temporal correlations can lead to significant errors in estimating epidemic dynamics emphasizing the need for a temporal framework to develop more accurate strategies for disease control,0
additionally the world bank and some wealthy donor countries have pressured developing countries to use free market policies even as the united states and europe extensively subsidized their own farmers they urged developing countries to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs like fertilizer without subsidies few if any farmers in developing countries can afford fertilizer at market prices this leads to low agricultural production low wages and high unaffordable food prices fertilizer is also increasingly unavailable because western environmental groups have fought to end its use due to environmental concerns the green revolution pioneers norman borlaug and keith rosenberg cited as the obstacle to feeding africa by ,0
coeliac disease is an immune reaction to eating gluten a protein found in wheat barley and rye for those with the disease eating gluten triggers an immune response in the small intestine leading to damage on the villi small fingerlike projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption this explains the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers as the gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and anus all areas that the ingested gluten would traverse in digestion the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer can be partially reduced or eliminated if a patient removes gluten from their diet additionally coeliac disease is correlated with lymphoproliferative disorders,0
bioinformatics is considered both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology as well as a reference to specific analysis pipelines that are repeatedly used particularly in the field of genomics common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides snps often such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease unique adaptations desirable properties esp in agricultural species or differences between populations in a less formal way bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences,0
in some societies people sleep with at least one other person sometimes many or with animals in other cultures people rarely sleep with anyone except for an intimate partner in almost all societies sleeping partners are strongly regulated by social standards for example a person might only sleep with the immediate family the extended family a spouse or romantic partner children children of a certain age children of a specific gender peers of a certain gender friends peers of equal social rank or with no one at all sleep may be an actively social time depending on the sleep groupings with no constraints on noise or activity,0
"a key policy framework that arose from this renewed global commitment towards surgical care worldwide is the national surgical obstetric and anesthesia plan nsoap nsoap focuses on policytoaction capacity building for surgical care with tangible steps as follows 1 analysis of baseline indicators 2 partnership with local champions 3 broad stakeholder engagement 4 consensus building and synthesis of ideas 5 language refinement 6 costing 7 dissemination and 8 implementation this approach has been widely adopted and has served as guiding principles between international collaborators and local institutions and governments successful implementations have allowed for sustainability in terms of longterm monitoring quality improvement, and continued political and financial support.",0
dysfunction of the immune system can cause autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancer immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal resulting in recurring and lifethreatening infections in humans immunodeficiency can be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency acquired conditions such as hivaids or the use of immunosuppressive medication autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms common autoimmune diseases include hashimotos thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis diabetes mellitus type 1 and systemic lupus erythematosus immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system,0
criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is descriptive rather than prescriptivem,0
protists include all eukaryotes that are not animals plants or fungi resulting in great diversity between them algae are photosynthetic protists that can produce energy from light several types of protists use mycelium similar to those of fungi protozoa are heterotrophic protists and different protozoa seek nutrients in different ways flagellate protozoa use a flagellum to assist in hunting for food and some protozoa travel via infectious spores to act as parasites many protists are mixotrophic having both phototrophic and heterotrophic characteristics mixotrophic protists will typically depend on one source of nutrients while using the other as a supplemental source or a temporary alternative when its primary source is unavailable,0
mathematicians often strive for a classification or list of all mathematical objects of a given type it is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification a more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite simple groups these are finite groups that may be used as building blocks for constructing arbitrary finite groups in the same way that prime numbers can be used to construct arbitrary whole numbers by taking productse one of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the classification of finite simple groups a mathematical theorem that provides a list of all possible finite simple groups,0
the earliest use of electronic digital computers for medicine was for dental projects in the 1950s at the united states national bureau of standards by robert ledley during the mid1950s the united states air force usaf carried out several medical projects on its computers while also encouraging civilian agencies such as the national academy of sciences  national research council nasnrc and the national institutes of health nih to sponsor such work in 1959 ledley and lee b lusted published reasoning foundations of medical diagnosis a widely read article in science which introduced computing especially operations research techniques to medical workers ledley and lusteds article has remained influential for decades especially within the field of medical decision making,0
"there are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy with important similarities among them use of the term cbt may refer to different interventions including selfinstructions eg distraction imagery motivational selftalk relaxation andor biofeedback development of adaptive coping strategies eg minimizing negative or selfdefeating thoughts changing maladaptive beliefs about pain and goal setting treatment is sometimes manualized with brief direct and timelimited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific techniquedriven cbt is used in both individual and group settings and the techniques are often adapted for selfhelp applications. some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. cognitive restructuring), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. in vivo exposure therapy). interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.",0
there are different theories about what causes famine some theorists like the indian economist amartya sen believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population in this view malnutrition is caused by unequal distribution of resources and under or unused arable land for example sen argues that no matter how a famine is caused methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the public distribution system this applies not only to organizing rationing and control but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation,0
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens this allows killer t cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal this is a common phenomenon with tumors sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system,0
in most developed countries there are two main types of lab processing the majority of medical specimens hospital laboratories are attached to a hospital and perform tests on their patients private or community laboratories receive samples from general practitioners insurance companies clinical research sites and other health clinics for analysis for extremely specialised tests samples may go to a research laboratory some tests involve specimens sent between different labs for uncommon tests for example in some cases it may be more cost effective if a particular laboratory specializes in a less common tests receiving specimens and payment from other labs while sending other specimens to other labs for those tests they do not perform,0
an earlier precursor of systems biology as a distinct discipline may have been by systems theorist mihajlo mesarovic in 1966 with an international symposium at the case institute of technology in cleveland ohio titled systems theory and biology mesarovic predicted that perhaps in the future there would be such a thing as systems biology other early precursors that focused on the view that biology should be analyzed as a system rather than a simple collection of parts were metabolic control analysis developed by henrik kacser and jim burns later thoroughly revised and reinhart heinrich and tom rapoport and biochemical systems theory developed by michael savageau,0
air pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation from 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel smaller contributions come from black carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and from dust globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much,0
initially many physicists hoped that by compactifying elevendimensional supergravity it might be possible to construct realistic models of our fourdimensional world the hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature electromagnetism the strong and weak nuclear forces and gravity interest in elevendimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered one of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise a phenomenon known as chirality edward witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions,0
the cardiac electrophysiology study typically measures the response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to pes on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained ventricular tachycardia vt or ventricular fibrillation vf in the future sometimes a series of electrophysiologystudy drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for longterm treatment that best prevents or slows the development of vt or vf following pes such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or aicd,0
various studies on humans have made use of enforced sleepwake cycles strongly different from 24 hours such as those conducted by nathaniel kleitman in 1938 28 hours and derkjan dijk and charles czeisler in the 1990s 20 hours because people with a normal typical circadian clock cannot entrain to such abnormal daynight rhythms this is referred to as a forced desynchrony protocol under such a protocol sleep and wake episodes are uncoupled from the bodys endogenous circadian period which allows researchers to assess the effects of circadian phase ie the relative timing of the circadian cycle on aspects of sleep and wakefulness including sleep latency and other functions  both physiological behavioral and cognitive,0
green and green 1986 investigated voluntary control of internal states by individuals like swami rama and american indian medicine man rolling thunder both in india and at the menninger foundation they brought portable biofeedback equipment to india and monitored practitioners as they demonstrated selfregulation a film containing footage from their investigations was released as biofeedback the yoga of the west 1974 they developed alphatheta training at the menninger foundation from the 1960s to the 1990s they hypothesized that theta states allow access to unconscious memories and increase the impact of prepared images or suggestions their alphatheta research fostered penistons development of an alphatheta addiction protocol,0
genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies within a population from one generation to the next when selective forces are absent or relatively weak allele frequencies are equally likely to drift upward or downwardclarification needed in each successive generation because the alleles are subject to sampling error this drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed either by disappearing from the population or by replacing the other alleles entirely genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone even in the absence of selective forces genetic drift can cause two separate populations that begin with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles,0
cardiovascularrelated artificial organs are implanted in cases where the heart its valves or another part of the circulatory system is in disorder the artificial heart is typically used to bridge the time to heart transplantation or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible artificial pacemakers represent another cardiovascular device that can be implanted to either intermittently augment defibrillator mode continuously augment or completely bypass the natural living cardiac pacemaker as needed ventricular assist devices are another alternative acting as mechanical circulatory devices that partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart without the removal of the heart itself,0
external fixation of fractures was refined by american surgeons during the vietnam war but a major contribution was made by gavril abramovich ilizarov in the ussr he was sent without much orthopedic training to look after injured russian soldiers in siberia in the 1950s with no equipment he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed infected and misaligned fractures with the help of the local bicycle shop he devised ring external fixators tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle with this equipment he achieved healing realignment and lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere his ilizarov apparatus is still used today as one of the distraction osteogenesis methods,0
vitamins are organic molecules or a set of closely related molecules called vitamers that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic function essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival and therefore must be obtained through the diet for example vitamin c can be synthesized by some species but not by others it is not considered a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second most vitamins are not single molecules but groups of related molecules called vitamers for example there are eight vitamers of vitamin e four tocopherols and four tocotrienols,0
general systems theory is about developing broadly applicable concepts and principles as opposed to concepts and principles specific to one domain of knowledge it distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes or interrelate through formal contextual boundary conditions attractors passive systems are structures and components that are being processed for example a computer program is passive when it is a file stored on the hard drive and active when it runs in memory the field is related to systems thinking machine logic and systems engineering,0
newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint such as bacteria fungi and nematodes molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology for example molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous in a biogeographical context the marriage between genetics ecology and evolution resulted in a new subdiscipline called phylogeography,0
after the rediscovery of mendels work scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance in 1900 nettie stevens began studying the mealworm over the next 11 years she discovered that females only had the x chromosome and males had both x and y chromosomes she was able to conclude that sex is a chromosomal factor and is determined by the male in 1911 thomas hunt morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes based on observations of a sexlinked white eye mutation in fruit flies in 1913 his student alfred sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome,0
excessive consumption of energydense foods and drinks and limited physical activity causes overnutrition it causes overweight defined as a body mass index bmi of 25 or more and can lead to obesity a bmi of 30 or more obesity has become a major health issue worldwide overnutrition is linked to chronic noncommunicable diseases like diabetes certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases hence identifying and addressing the immediate risk factors has become a major health priority the recent evidence on the impact of dietinduced obesity in fathers and mothers around the time of conception is identified to negatively program the health outcomes of multiple generations,0
most programs available for protein analysis are not written for proteins that have undergone posttranslational modifications some programs will accept posttranslational modifications to aid in protein identification but then ignore the modification during further protein analysis it is important to account for these modifications since they can affect the proteins structure in turn computational analysis of posttranslational modifications has gained the attention of the scientific community the current posttranslational modification programs are only predictive chemists biologists and computer scientists are working together to create and introduce new pipelines that allow for analysis of posttranslational modifications that have been experimentally identified for their effect on the proteins structure and function,0
quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems it is typically applied to microscopic systems molecules atoms and subatomic particles it has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems such as wigners friend and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy for example the refinement of quantum mechanics for the interaction of light and matter known as quantum electrodynamics qed has been shown to agree with experiment to within 1 part in 1012 when predicting the magnetic properties of an electron,0
aerobic exercise has both short and long term effects on mood and emotional states by promoting positive affect inhibiting negative affect and decreasing the biological response to acute psychological stress aerobic exercise may affect both selfesteem and overall wellbeing including sleep patterns with consistent long term participation regular aerobic exercise may improve symptoms associated with central nervous system disorders and may be used as adjunct therapy for these disorders there is some evidence of exercise treatment efficacy for major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the american academy of neurologys clinical practice guideline for mild cognitive impairment indicates that clinicians should recommend regular exercise two times per week to individuals who have been diagnosed with these conditions,0
women typically make up some 80 of autoimmune disease patients whilst many proposals have been made for the cause of this high weighting no clear explanation is available a possible role for hormonal factors has been suggested for example some autoimmune diseases tend to flare during pregnancy possibly as an evolutionary mechanism to increase health protection for the child when hormone levels are high and improve after menopause when hormone levels decrease women may also naturally have autoimmune disease trigger events in puberty and pregnancy underreporting by men may also be a factor as men may interact less with the health system than women,0
costsaving and costeffective benefits of preventive care measures are well established the robert wood johnson foundation evaluated the prevention costeffectiveness literature and found that many preventive measures meet the benchmark of 100000 per qaly and are considered to be favorably costeffective these include screenings for hiv and chlamydia cancers of the colon breast and cervix vision screening and screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men 60 in certain populations alcohol and tobacco screening were found to be costsaving in some reviews and costeffective in others according to the rwjf analysis two preventive interventions were found to save costs in all reviews childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of aspirin,0
eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents the process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome haploid and double copies diploid haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes diploid organisms form haploids by dividing without replicating their dna to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or eggs,0
systems for medical classification of drugs with pharmaceutical codes have been developed these include the national drug code ndc administered by food and drug administration drug identification number din administered by health canada under the food and drugs act hong kong drug registration administered by the pharmaceutical service of the department of health hong kong and national pharmaceutical product index in south africa hierarchical systems have also been developed including the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system at or atcddd administered by world health organization generic product identifier gpi a hierarchical classification number published by medispan and snomed c axis ingredients of drugs have been categorised by unique ingredient identifier,0
genes are arranged linearly along long chains of dna basepair sequences in bacteria each cell usually contains a single circular genophore while eukaryotic organisms such as plants and animals have their dna arranged in multiple linear chromosomes these dna strands are often extremely long the largest human chromosome for example is about 247 million base pairs in length the dna of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize compact and control access to the dna forming a material called chromatin in eukaryotes chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes segments of dna wound around cores of histone proteins the full set of hereditary material in an organism usually the combined dna sequences of all chromosomes is called the genome,0
the underlying concept of an ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of george perkins marsh man and nature within an ecosystem organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form selforganizing patterns across different scales of time and space ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial freshwater atmospheric or marine differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each a more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity,0
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeologycitation needed further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human pastcitation needed anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions timebased and cultural regions spacebased anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science,0
a true experiment with random assignment of research participants sometimes called subjects to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships when there are large numbers of research participants the random assignment also called random allocation of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will on average be similar on most characteristics including characteristics that went unmeasured in an experiment the researcher alters one or more variables of influence called independent variables and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest called dependent variables prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment,0
through the use of genomics microarray proteomics tissue array and imaging fmri microct technologies molecularscale information about patients can be easily obtained these socalled molecular biomarkers have proven powerful in disease prognosis such as with cancer the main three areas of cancer prediction fall under cancer recurrence cancer susceptibility and cancer survivability combining molecular scale information with macroscale clinical data such as patients tumor type and other risk factors significantly improves prognosis consequently given the use of molecular biomarkers especially genomics cancer prognosis or prediction has become very effective especially when screening a large population essentially population genomics screening can be used to identify people at risk for disease which can assist in preventative efforts,0
a pathologist ronald s weinstein md coined the term telepathology in 1986 in an editorial in a medical journal weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services he and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology weinstein was also granted the first us patents for robotic telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks weinstein is known to many as the father of telepathology in norway eide and nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989 this is still in operation decades later a number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in north america europe and asia,0
the teaching of evolution in american secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century the scopes trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in american secondary biology textbooks for a generation but it was gradually reintroduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 epperson v arkansas decision since then the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design id to be excluded once again in the 2005 kitzmiller v dover area school district case the debate over darwins ideas did not generate significant controversy in china,0
in general it is the most expensive technologically advanced and resourceintensive area of medical care in the united states estimates of the 2000 expenditure for critical care medicine ranged from us1955 billion during that year critical care medicine accounted for 056 of gdp 42 of national health expenditure and about 13 of hospital costs in 2011 hospital stays with icu services accounted for just over onequarter of all discharges 299 but nearly onehalf of aggregate total hospital charges 475 in the united states the mean hospital charge was 25 times higher for discharges with icu services than for those without,0
"the time evolution of a quantum state is described by the schrdinger equation i    t   t   h   t   displaystyle ihbar frac partial partial tpsi thpsi t here h displaystyle h denotes the hamiltonian the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system, and  {\displaystyle \hbar } is the reduced planck constant. the constant i  {\displaystyle i\hbar } is introduced so that the hamiltonian is reduced to the classical hamiltonian in cases where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system; the ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the correspondence principle.",0
the diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed in this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine however they do via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover during crossover chromosomes exchange stretches of dna effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells meiotic recombination particularly in microbial eukaryotes appears to serve the adaptive function of repair of dna damages,0
nanomaterials describe in principle materials of which a single unit is sized in at least one dimension between 1 and 1000 nanometers 109 meter but is usually 1 nm  100 nm nanomaterials research takes a materials science based approach to nanotechnology using advances in materials metrology and synthesis which have been developed in support of microfabrication research materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical electronic or mechanical properties the field of nanomaterials is loosely organized like the traditional field of chemistry into organic carbonbased nanomaterials such as fullerenes and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements such as silicon examples of nanomaterials include fullerenes carbon nanotubes nanocrystals etc,0
ultraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200  10 to 320 nm light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the earths atmosphere requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars ob stars that are very bright in this wave band this includes the blue stars in other galaxies which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei however as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary,0
circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes they thus enable organisms to make better use of environmental resources eg light and food compared to those that cannot predict such availability it has therefore been suggested that circadian rhythms put organisms at a selective advantage in evolutionary terms however rhythmicity appears to be as important in regulating and coordinating internal metabolic processes as in coordinating with the environment this is suggested by the maintenance heritability of circadian rhythms in fruit flies after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild and by the experimental elimination of behavioralbut not physiologicalcircadian rhythms in quail,0
national management system standards for occupational health and safety include asnzs 4801 for australia and new zealand now superseded by iso 45001 csa z100014 for canada which is due to be discontinued in favor of csa z4500119 the canadian adoption of iso 45000 and ansiassp z10 for the united states in germany the bavarian state government in collaboration with trade associations and private companies issued their ohris standard for occupational health and safety management systems a new revision was issued in 2018 the taiwan occupational safety and health management system toshms was issued in 1997 under the auspices of taiwans occupational safety and health administration,0
vegetarianism is occasionally depicted in mass media some scholars have argued that mass media serves as a source of information for individuals interested in vegetarianism or veganism while there are increasing social sanctions against eating meat over time societal attitudes of vegetarianism have changed as have perceptions of vegetarianism in popular culture leading to more vegetarian sentiment even so there are still existing meatbased food metaphors which infuse daily speech and those who are vegetarian and vegan are met with acceptance tolerance or hostility after they divulge they are vegetarian or vegan some writers such as john l cunningham editor of the vegetarian resource groups newsletter have argued for more sympathetic vegetarian characters in the mass media,0
in august 1944 several members of the vegetarian society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to nondairy vegetarianism when the request was denied donald watson secretary of the leicester branch set up a new quarterly newsletter the vegan news in november 1944 the word vegan was invented by watson and dorothy morgan a schoolteacher he later married the word is based on the first three and last two letters of vegetarian because it marked in watsons words the beginning and end of vegetarian the vegan news asked its readers if they could think of anything better than vegan to stand for nondairy vegetarian they suggested allvega neovegetarian dairyban vitan benevore sanivores and beaumangeur.,0
sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patients blood nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes which are pencilsized devices that are used in surgeries with lights and cameras so surgeons can do the surgeries with smaller incisions the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair,0

other antioxidants are not obtained from the diet but instead are made in the body for example ubiquinol coenzyme q is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway another example is glutathione which is made from amino acids as any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body although large amounts of sulfurcontaining amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults,0
another example of synthetic biology applications in industrial biotechnology is the reengineering of the metabolic pathways of e coli by crispr and crispri systems toward the production of a chemical known as 14butanediol which is used in fiber manufacturing in order to produce 14butanediol the authors alter the metabolic regulation of the escherichia coli by crispr to induce point mutation in the glta gene knockout of the sad gene and knockin six genes cat1 sucd 4hbd cat2 bld and bdh whereas crispri system used to knockdown the three competing genes gabd ybgc and tesb that affect the biosynthesis pathway of 14butanediol consequently the yield of 14butanediol significantly increased from 09 to 18 g/l.,0
allelespecific oligonucleotide aso is a technique that allows detection of single base mutations without the need for pcr or gel electrophoresis short 2025 nucleotides in length labeled probes are exposed to the nonfragmented target dna hybridization occurs with high specificity due to the short length of the probes and even a single base change will hinder hybridization the target dna is then washed and the unhybridized probes are removed the target dna is then analyzed for the presence of the probe via radioactivity or fluorescence in this experiment as in most molecular biology techniques a control must be used to ensure successful experimentation,0
as with the chemical antioxidants cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes here the superoxide released by processes such as oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water this detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide as with antioxidant metabolites the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative,0
in general the deep sea is considered to start at the aphotic zone the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as bioluminescence marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed hydrothermal vents along the midocean ridge spreading centers act as oases as do their opposites cold seeps such places support unique biomes and many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations there is still much more to learn about the deeper parts of the ocean,0
global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale these oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months such as the maddenjulian oscillation or years such as the el niosouthern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology the traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions,0
there are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy including renewables wind and solar produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability traditionally hydro dams with reservoirs and fossil fuel power plants have been used when variable energy production is low going forward battery storage can be expanded energy demand and supply can be matched and longdistance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs bioenergy is often not carbonneutral and may have negative consequences for food security the growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around radioactive waste nuclear weapon proliferation and accidents hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns,0
when compared to studies of maternal transmission investigations into the role of paternal diets are lacking a review demonstrated the nutrition of both parents do in fact play a role in determining the health of their offspring a germline study reported paternal rats fed a highfat diet led to insulin dysfunction in the f1 offspring while this likely occurs via epigenetic modifications similar to those postulated in the maternal diets the exact mechanism remains to be defined assessing the role of epigenetic mechanisms may be easier using paternal inheritance as sperm transmits epigenetic and genetic information whereas the female cells also transmit mitochondrial dna,0
epigenetic changes modify the activation of certain genes but not the genetic code sequence of dna the microstructure not code of dna itself or the associated chromatin proteins may be modified causing activation or silencing this mechanism enables differentiated cells in a multicellular organism to express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organisms lifetime however these epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the organisms offspring through a process called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance moreover if gene inactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization this epigenetic modification may also be transferred to the next generation,0
another similar technology space is virtual reality which creates interactive simulations that mimic reallife scenarios and can be tailored for personalized treatments many stroke victims lose range of motion and under standard treatment protocols 55 to 75 of patients have longterm upper muscular dysfunction as the lower body is primarily targeted during therapy repeated actions and the length of therapy are the two main factors that show positive progress towards recovery virtual reality technologies can create various 3d environments that are difficult to replace in reallife but are necessary to help patients retrain their motor movements these simulations can not only target specific body parts but can also increase in intensity as the patient improves and requires more challenging tasks,0
more recently exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century in 1858 archibald maclaren opened a gymnasium at the university of oxford and instituted a training regimen for major frederick hammersley and 12 noncommissioned officers this regimen was assimilated into the training of the british army which formed the army gymnastic staff in 1860 and made sport an important part of military life several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well the first and most significant of these in the uk was the womens league of health and beauty founded in 1930 by mary bagot stack that had 166000 members in 1937,0

currently the leading candidate for a theory going beyond the big bang is the theory of cosmic inflation developed by alan guth and others in the 1980s inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard big bang theory the theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the big bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe the theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380000 years after the big bang,0
the tabular representation lends itself well to computational applications there are different ways to store graphs in a computer system the data structure used depends on both the graph structure and the algorithm used for manipulating the graph theoretically one can distinguish between list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure is often a combination of both list structures are often preferred for sparse graphs as they have smaller memory requirements matrix structures on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can consume huge amounts of memory implementations of sparse matrix structures that are efficient on modern parallel computer architectures are an object of current investigation,0
a later document in the timeline of global initiatives for malnutrition was the 1996 rome declaration on world food security organized by the food and agriculture organization this document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritious food by everyone also considering that everyone gets sufficient food and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halving their number of undernourished people by 2015 in 2004 the food and agriculture organization adopted the right to food guidelines which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis,0
unlike animals plants lack phagocytic cells but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogenassociated molecular patterns or pamps when a part of a plant becomes infected the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant systemic acquired resistance is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication,0

the sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps each of which may have a different speed many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions several empirical rules like the woodwardhoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction,0
throughout the 1950s and 1960s a bewildering variety of particles was found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy it was referred to informally as the particle zoo important discoveries such as the cp violation by james cronin and val fitch brought new questions to matterantimatter imbalance after the formulation of the standard model during the 1970s physicists clarified the origin of the particle zoo the large number of particles was explained as combinations of a relatively small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of quantum field theories this reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics,0
the first diva vaccines formerly termed marker vaccines and since 1999 coined as diva vaccines and companion diagnostic tests were developed by j t van oirschot and colleagues at the central veterinary institute in lelystad the netherlands they found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies also termed aujeszkys disease had deletions in their viral genome among which was the ge gene monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an elisa that demonstrated antibodies against ge in addition novel genetically engineered genegative vaccines were constructed along the same lines diva vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus 1 infections have been developed,0
hormones are important agents in sexrelated cancers such as cancer of the breast endometrium prostate ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer for example the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer these higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer even in the absence of a breastcancer gene similarly men of african ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of european ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer men of asian ancestry with the lowest levels of testosteroneactivating androstanediol glucuronide have the lowest levels of prostate cancer,0
several apocryphal accounts of transplants exist well prior to the scientific understanding and advancements that would be necessary for them to have actually occurred the chinese physician pien chiao reportedly exchanged hearts between a man of strong spirit but weak will with one of a man of weak spirit but strong will in an attempt to achieve balance in each man roman catholic accounts report the 3rdcentury saints damian and cosmas as replacing the gangrenous or cancerous leg of the roman deacon justinian with the leg of a recently deceased ethiopian most accounts have the saints performing the transplant in the 4th century many decades after their deaths some accounts have them only instructing living surgeons who performed the procedure,0
in the absence of catalysts proteins are slow to hydrolyze the breakdown of proteins to small peptides and amino acids proteolysis is a step in digestion these breakdown products are then absorbed in the small intestine the hydrolysis of proteins relies on enzymes called proteases or peptidases proteases which are themselves proteins come in several types according to the particular peptide bonds that they cleave as well as their tendency to cleave peptide bonds at the terminus of a protein exopeptidases vs peptide bonds at the interior of the protein endopeptidases pepsin is an endopeptidase in the stomach subsequent to the stomach the pancreas secretes other proteases to complete the hydrolysis these include trypsin and chymotrypsin,0
learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies,0
presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about 50 since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of years,0
an oral polio vaccine turned out to be effective when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines effective oral vaccines have many advantages for example there is no risk of blood contamination vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid and as solids they commonly are more stable and less prone to damage or spoilage by freezing in transport and storage such stability reduces the need for a cold chain the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration which in turn may decrease costs of vaccines,0

the biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature heat affects growth rates activity behaviour and primary production temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation the latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity poikilotherms for example have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment in contrast homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy,0
in germany xray images as well as mri medical ultrasound pet and scintigraphy images are protected by copyrightlike related rights or neighbouring rights this protection does not require creativity as would be necessary for regular copyright protection and lasts only for 50 years after image creation if not published within 50 years or for 50 years after the first legitimate publication the letter of the law grants this right to the lichtbildner ie the person who created the image the literature seems to uniformly consider the medical doctor dentist or veterinary physician as the rights holder which may result from the circumstance that in germany many xrays are performed in ambulatory settings,0
in the uk there were 135 fatal injuries at work in financial year 20222023 compared with 651 in 1974 the year when the health and safety at work act was promulgated the fatal injury rate declined from 21 fatalities per 100000 workers in 1981 to 041 in financial year 20222023 over recent decades reductions in both fatal and nonfatal workplace injuries have been very significant however illnesses statistics have not uniformly improved while musculoskeletal disorders have diminished the rate of selfreported workrelated stress depression or anxiety has increased and the rate of mesothelioma deaths has remained broadly flat due to past asbestos exposures,0
the transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance however heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer thus because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy for example ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy,0
the word nephrology appeared for the first time in a conference on 14 september 1960 at the premier congrs international de nphrologie in evian and geneva the first meeting of the international society of nephrology isn international society of nephrology the first day 1960 was in geneva and the next three 24960 were in evian france the early history of the isn is described by robinson and richet in 2005 and the later history by barsoum in 2011 the isn is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwidecitation needed it has an international office in brussels belgium,0
other drugs which can potentiate conventional analgesics or have analgesic properties in certain circumstances are called analgesic adjuvant medications gabapentin an anticonvulsant can reduce neuropathic pain itself and can also potentiate opiates drugs with anticholinergic activity such as orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are given in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are also muscle relaxants and are useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions clonidine an alpha2 receptor agonist is another drug that has found use as an analgesic adjuvant in 2021 researchers described a novel type of pain therapy  a crisprdcas9 epigenome editing method for repressing nav17 gene expression which showed therapeutic potential in three mouse models of chronic pain,0
organic compounds typically melt and many boil in contrast while inorganic materials generally can be melted many do not boil and instead tend to degrade in earlier times the melting point mp and boiling point bp provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds the melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight some organic compounds especially symmetrical ones sublime a wellknown example of a sublimable organic compound is paradichlorobenzene the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300 c although some exceptions exist,0
in may 2023 the fda approved beremagene geperpavec for the treatment of wounds in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb which is applied as a topical gel that delivers a herpessimplex virus type 1 hsv1 vector encoding the collagen type vii alpha 1 chain col7a1 gene that is dysfunctional on those affected by deb  one trial found 65 of the vyjuvektreated wounds completely closed while only 26 of the placebotreated at 24 weeks it has been also reported its use as an eyedrop for a patient with deb that had vision loss due to the widespread blistering with good results,0
the poor law commission reported in 1838 that the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered it recommended the implementation of large scale government engineering projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease the health of towns association was formed at exeter hall london on 11 december 1844 and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the united kingdom its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the health of towns commission chaired by sir edwin chadwick which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in british cities,0
the basic strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment and mitigation containment may be undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak including contact tracing and isolating infected individuals to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population other public health interventions on infection control and therapeutic countermeasures such as vaccinations which may be effective if available when it becomes apparent that it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease management will then move on to the mitigation stage in which measures are taken to slow the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on society and the healthcare system in reality containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken simultaneously,0
the bodys stores for different vitamins vary widely vitamins a d and b12 are stored in significant amounts mainly in the liver and an adults diet may be deficient in vitamins a and d for many months and b12 in some cases for years before developing a deficiency condition however vitamin b3 niacin and niacinamide is not stored in significant amounts so stores may last only a couple of weeks for vitamin c the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin c deprivation in humans have varied widely from a month to more than six months depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores,0
a 2018 metaanalysis found no support that daily intake of one gram of omega3 fatty acid in individuals with a history of coronary heart disease prevents fatal coronary heart disease nonfatal myocardial infarction or any other vascular event however omega3 fatty acid supplementation greater than one gram daily for at least a year may be protective against cardiac death sudden death and myocardial infarction in people who have a history of cardiovascular disease no protective effect against the development of stroke or allcause mortality was seen in this population a 2021 metaanalysis found that supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease,0
catalases are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen using either an iron or manganese cofactor this protein is localized to peroxisomes in most eukaryotic cells catalase is an unusual enzyme since although hydrogen peroxide is its only substrate it follows a pingpong mechanism here its cofactor is oxidised by one molecule of hydrogen peroxide and then regenerated by transferring the bound oxygen to a second molecule of substrate despite its apparent importance in hydrogen peroxide removal humans with genetic deficiency of catalase  acatalasemia  or mice genetically engineered to lack catalase completely experience few ill effects,0
some physical diseases are believed to have a mental component derived from stresses and strains of everyday living this has been suggested for example of lower back pain and high blood pressure which some researchers have suggested may be related to stresses in everyday life the psychosomatic framework additionally sees mental and emotional states as capable of significantly influencing the course of any physical illness psychiatry traditionally distinguishes between psychosomatic disorders disorders in which mental factors play a significant role in the development expression or resolution of a physical illness and somatoform disorders disorders in which mental factors are the sole cause of a physical illness,0
theranostics is a personalized approach in nuclear medicine using similar molecules for both imaging diagnosis and therapy the term is a portmanteau of therapeutics and diagnostics its most common applications are attaching radionuclides either gamma or positron emitters to molecules for spect or pet imaging or electron emitters for radiotherapycitation needed one of the earliest examples is the use of radioactive iodine for treatment of people with thyroid cancer other examples include radiolabelled anticd20 antibodies eg bexxar for treating lymphoma radium223 for treating bone metastases lutetium177 dotatate for treating neuroendocrine tumors and lutetium177 psma for treating prostate cancer a commonly used reagent is fluorodeoxyglucose using the isotope fluorine18,0
a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge,0
identical drugs can produce different results depending on the route of administration for example some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration this can be illustrated by the action of naloxone narcan an antagonist of opiates such as morphine naloxone counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose the same drug when swallowed acts exclusively on the bowels it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the painreducing effect of the opiate,0
in the pastwhen palliative care involved a diseasespecific approach but today the who takes a broader patientcentered approach that suggests that the principles of palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and ultimately fatal illness this shift was important because if a diseaseoriented approach is followed the needs and preferences of the patient are not fully met and aspects of care such as pain quality of life and social support as well as spiritual and emotional needs fail to be addressedcitation needed rather a patientcentered model prioritises relief of suffering and tailors care to increase the quality of life for terminally ill patientsneed quotation to verify,0
an essential nutrient is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body  either at all or in sufficient quantities  and thus must be obtained from a dietary source apart from water which is universally required for the maintenance of homeostasis in mammals essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular metabolic processes and for the maintenance and function of tissues and organs the nutrients considered essential for humans comprise nine amino acids two fatty acids thirteen vitamins fifteen minerals and choline in addition there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states,0
another critical developmental time window is the perinatal period the time immediately before and after birth it has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infants diet in the beginning weeks can significantly impact gene expression and epigenetics dna methylation and histone modification therefore perinatal nutrition is both latestage in utero nutrition and lactation the nutritional composition of breast milk which varies in response to maternal diet can shape the infants metabolic and immune systems potentially causing them to become susceptible to disease according to research disruptions in perinatal nutrition or an inadequate maternal intake of essential micronutrients can increase the risk of obtaining metabolic disorders like cardiovascular disease and obesity,0
some people follow a vegan diet but not other aspects of veganism dietary veganism is limited to following a plantbased diet dietary veganism is in contrast to ethical veganism which is defined as a philosophical belief that is a protected characteristic under the uks equality act 2010 authors like richard twine and breeze harper argue that dietary veganism cannot be called veganism as veganism is more than a diet gary l francione has argued that the promotion of dietary veganism lacks the moral imperative expressed by leslie j cross an early and influential vicepresident of the vegan society who said in 1949 that veganism was the abolition of the exploitation of animals by man,0
"a key policy framework that arose from this renewed global commitment towards surgical care worldwide is the national surgical obstetric and anesthesia plan nsoap nsoap focuses on policytoaction capacity building for surgical care with tangible steps as follows 1 analysis of baseline indicators 2 partnership with local champions 3 broad stakeholder engagement 4 consensus building and synthesis of ideas 5 language refinement 6 costing 7 dissemination and 8 implementation this approach has been widely adopted and has served as guiding principles between international collaborators and local institutions and governments successful implementations have allowed for sustainability in terms of longterm monitoring quality improvement, and continued political and financial support.",0
credit for the first psychology clinic in the united states typically goes to lightner witmer who established his practice in philadelphia in 1896 another modern psychotherapist was morton prince an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline in the first part of the twentieth century most mental health care in the united states was performed by psychiatrists who are medical doctors psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problems for their part some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill,0
although the study of animal life is ancient its scientific incarnation is relatively modern this mirrors the transition from natural history to biology at the start of the 19th century since hunter and cuvier comparative anatomical study has been associated with morphography shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation anatomy physiology histology embryology teratology and ethology modern zoology first arose in german and british universities in britain thomas henry huxley was a prominent figure his ideas were centered on the morphology of animals many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century similar to hunter his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only,0
blood pressure medication reduces cardiovascular disease in people at risk irrespective of age the baseline level of cardiovascular risk or baseline blood pressure the commonlyused drug regimens have similar efficacy in reducing the risk of all major cardiovascular events although there may be differences between drugs in their ability to prevent specific outcomes larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk and most people with high blood pressure require more than one drug to achieve adequate reduction in blood pressure adherence to medications is often poor and while mobile phone text messaging has been tried to improve adherence there is insufficient evidence that it alters secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease,0
following the dark ages mathematics education in europe was provided by religious schools as part of the quadrivium formal instruction in pedagogy began with jesuit schools in the 16th and 17th century most mathematical curricula remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century when it began to flourish in france and germany the oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was lenseignement mathmatique which began publication in 1899 the western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nationstates with mathematics as a core componentinitially for its military applications while the content of courses varies in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time,0
optics began with the development of lenses by the ancient egyptians and mesopotamians the earliest known lenses made from polished crystal often quartz date from as early as 2000 bc from crete archaeological museum of heraclion greece lenses from rhodes date around 700 bc as do assyrian lenses such as the nimrud lens the ancient romans and greeks filled glass spheres with water to make lenses these practical developments were followed by the development of theories of light and vision by ancient greek and indian philosophers and the development of geometrical optics in the grecoroman world the word optics comes from the ancient greek word  optik appearance look,0
polymers are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains polymers are the raw materials the resins used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber plastics and rubber are the final product created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing which is then shaped into a final form plastics in former and in current widespread use include polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene nylons polyesters acrylics polyurethanes and polycarbonates rubbers include natural rubber styrenebutadiene rubber chloroprene and butadiene rubber plastics are generally classified as commodity specialty and engineering plastics,0
in 1975 stephen hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon at first hawkings result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information more precisely hawkings calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the schrdinger equation this property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution the apparent contradiction between hawkings calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the black hole information paradox,0
an ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons becoming a positively charged cation and the electrons are then gained by the nonmetal atom becoming a negatively charged anion the two oppositely charged ions attract one another and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them for example sodium na a metal loses one electron to become an na cation while chlorine cl a nonmetal gains this electron to become cl the ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction and that compound sodium chloride nacl or common table salt is formed,0
as the rising success rate of transplants and modern immunosuppression make transplants more common the need for more organs has become critical transplants from living donors especially relatives have become increasingly common additionally there is substantive research into xenotransplantation or transgenic organs although these forms of transplant are not yet being used in humans clinical trials involving the use of specific cell types have been conducted with promising results such as using porcine islets of langerhans to treat type 1 diabetes however there are still many problems that would need to be solved before they would be feasible options in people requiring transplants,0
paleontology lies on the border between biology and geology but it differs from archaeology in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans it now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences including biochemistry mathematics and engineering use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life almost back to when earth became capable of supporting life nearly 4 billion years ago as knowledge has increased paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history such as ancient climates,0
in the 1960s the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by edward lorenz founding the field of chaos theory these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the earth climate models have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models these climate models are used to investigate longterm climate shifts such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases,0
the mosfet invented at bell labs between 1955 and 1960 two years later leland c clark and champ lyons invented the first biosensor in 1962 biosensor mosfets were later developed and they have since been widely used to measure physical chemical biological and environmental parameters the first biofet was the ionsensitive fieldeffect transistor isfet invented by piet bergveld in 1970 it is a special type of mosfet where the metal gate is replaced by an ionsensitive membrane electrolyte solution and reference electrode the isfet is widely used in biomedical applications such as the detection of dna hybridization biomarker detection from blood antibody detection glucose measurement ph sensing and genetic technology,0
mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1 km to 1000 km and a vertical scale that starts at the earths surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer troposphere tropopause and the lower section of the stratosphere the terms mesoalpha mesobeta and mesogamma to classify the horizontal scales of atmospheric processes were introduced to the field of mesoscale meteorology by isidoro orlanski mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to multiple weeks the events typically of interest are thunderstorms squall lines fronts precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes,0
a dermatopathologist is a pathologist or dermatologist who specializes in the pathology of the skin this field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists usually a dermatologist or pathologist completes one year of dermatopathology fellowship and according to market projections it is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 114 from 2022 to 2030 this usually includes six months of general pathology and six months of dermatopathology alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists at the completion of a standard residency in dermatology many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathologycitation needed,0
functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects such as genome sequencing projects to describe gene and protein functions and interactions functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription translation and proteinprotein interactions as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as dna sequence or structures functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of dna at the levels of genes rna transcripts and protein products a key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genomewide approach to these questions generally involving highthroughput methods rather than a more traditional genebygene approach,0
in 1974 tamiaki yoneya discovered that all the known string theories included a massless spintwo particle that obeyed the correct ward identities to be a graviton john schwarz and jol scherk came to the same conclusion and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity not a theory of hadrons they reintroduced kaluzaklein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions at the same time quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history,0
many species however use mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity immune systems appear even in the structurally simplest forms of life with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens called bacteriophages prokaryotes bacteria and archea also possess acquired immunity through a system that uses crispr sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past which allows them to block virus replication through a form of rna interference prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes but studies of their roles in defense are few,0
acid strength is commonly measured by two methods one measurement based on the arrhenius definition of acidity is ph which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale thus solutions that have a low ph have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic the other measurement based on the brnstedlowry definition is the acid dissociation constant ka which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the brnstedlowry definition of an acid that is substances with a higher ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower ka values,0
in 1895 george ellery hale and james e keeler along with a group of ten associate editors from europe and the united states established the astrophysical journal an international review of spectroscopy and astronomical physics it was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption on theories of the sun moon planets comets meteors and nebulae and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories,0
behavioral medicine is concerned with the integration of knowledge in the biological behavioral psychological and social sciences relevant to health and illness these sciences include epidemiology anthropology sociology psychology physiology pharmacology nutrition neuroanatomy endocrinology and immunology the term is often used interchangeably but incorrectly with health psychologycitation needed the practice of behavioral medicine encompasses health psychology but also includes applied psychophysiological therapies such as biofeedback hypnosis and biobehavioral therapy of physical disorders aspects of occupational therapy rehabilitation medicine and physiatry as well as preventive medicine in contrast health psychology represents a stronger emphasis specifically on psychologys role in both behavioral medicine and behavioral health,0
in the workplace managing stress becomes vital in order to keep up job performance as well as relationship with coworkers and employers for some workers changing the work environment relieves work stress making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stresscitation neededcompanies and businesses tend to be more successful when the work environment facilitates more cooperation rather than competition in the workplace people feel more comfortable and capable of completing the work due to their support from coworkers and employers as a result both companies and employees benefit from a cooperating relationship competition in the workplace can leave employees feeling like it is every man for himself which can increase stress,0
addressing and eliminating the social stigma and perceived stigma attached to mental illness has been recognized as crucial to education and awareness surrounding mental health issues in the united kingdom the royal college of psychiatrists organized the campaign changing minds 19982003 to help reduce stigma while in the united states efforts by entities such as the born this way foundation and the manic monologues specifically focus on removing the stigma surrounding mental illness the national alliance on mental illness nami is a us institution founded in 1979 to represent and advocate for those struggling with mental health issues nami helps to educate about mental illnesses and health issues while also working to eliminate stigma attached to these disorders,0
recent studies have also found that learning multiple languages not only restructures the brain but also boosts brains capacity for plasticity a recent study found that multilingualism not only affects the grey matter but also white matter of the brain white matter is made up of myelinated axons that is greatly associated with learning and communication neurolinguists used a diffusion tensor imaging dti scanning method to determine the white matter intensity between monolinguals and bilinguals increased myelinations in white matter tracts were found in bilingual individuals who actively used both languages in everyday life the demand of handling more than one language requires more efficient connectivity within the brain which resulted in greater white matter density for multilinguals,0
racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with higher prevalence of diabetes compared to nonminority individuals while us adults overall have a 40 chance of developing type 2 diabetes hispaniclatino adults chance is more than 50 african americans also are much more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared to white americans asians have increased risk of diabetes as diabetes can develop at lower bmi due to differences in visceral fat compared to other races for asians diabetes can develop at a younger age and lower body fat compared to other groups additionally diabetes is highly underreported in asian american people as 1 in 3 cases are undiagnosed compared to the average 1 in 5 for the nation,0
helicobacter pylori infection can initiate formation of stomach ulcers when the bacteria penetrate the stomach epithelial lining then causing an inflammatory phagocytotic response in turn the inflammation damages parietal cells which release excessive hydrochloric acid into the stomach and produce less of the protective mucus injury to the stomach lining leading to ulcers develops when gastric acid overwhelms the defensive properties of cells and inhibits endogenous prostaglandin synthesis reduces mucus and bicarbonate secretion reduces mucosal blood flow and lowers resistance to injury reduced protective properties of the stomach lining increase vulnerability to further injury and ulcer formation by stomach acid pepsin and bile salts,0
others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original systems theorists for example ilya prigogine of the center for complex quantum systems at the university of texas has studied emergent properties suggesting that they offer analogues for living systems the distinction of autopoiesis as made by humberto maturana and francisco varela represent further developments in this field important names in contemporary systems science include russell ackoff ruzena bajcsy bla h bnthy gregory bateson anthony stafford beer peter checkland barbara grosz brian wilson robert l flood allenna leonard radhika nagpal fritjof capra warren mcculloch kathleen carley michael c jackson katia sycara and edgar morin among others,0
in other scientific contexts the term calorie and the symbol cal almost always refers to the small unit the large unit being generally called kilocalorie with symbol kcal it is mostly used to express the amount of energy released in a chemical reaction or phase change typically per mole of substance as in kilocalories per mole it is also occasionally used to specify other energy quantities that relate to reaction energy such as enthalpy of formation and the size of activation barriers however it is increasingly being superseded by the si unit the joule j and metric multiples thereof such as the kilojoule kjcitation needed,0
in poland computational biology is closely linked to mathematics and computational science serving as a foundation for bioinformatics and biological physics the field is divided into two main areas one focusing on physics and simulation and the other on biological sequences the application of statistical models in poland has advanced techniques for studying proteins and rna contributing to global scientific progress polish scientists have also been instrumental in evaluating protein prediction methods significantly enhancing the field of computational biology over time they have expanded their research to cover topics such as proteincoding analysis and hybrid structures further solidifying polands influence on the development of bioinformatics worldwide,0
the sleep cycle of alternate nrem and rem sleep takes an average of 90 minutes occurring 46 times in a good nights sleep the american academy of sleep medicine aasm divides nrem into three stages n1 n2 and n3 the last of which is also called delta sleep or slowwave sleep the whole period normally proceeds in the order n1  n2  n3  n2  rem rem sleep occurs as a person returns to stage 2 or 1 from a deep sleep there is a greater amount of deep sleep stage n3 earlier in the night while the proportion of rem sleep increases in the two cycles just before natural awakening,0
moreover we could refer to the privacy issue at all layers of personalized medicine from discovery to treatment one of the leading issues is the consent of the patients to have their information used in genetic testing algorithms primarily ai algorithms the consent of the institution who is providing the data to be used is of prominent concern as well in 2008 the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers on february 19 2015 fda issued a press release titled fda permits marketing of first directtoconsumer genetic carrier test for bloom syndrome,0
there have also been largescale efforts to improve health literacy for example a public information program by the us department of health and human services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment additionally the irohla intervention research on health literacy of the ageing population project funded by the european union eu seeks to develop evidencebased guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in eu member states the project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly,0
attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder or adhd is a neurodevelopment disorder that is characterized by trouble paying attention difficulty controlling impulsive behaviors andor hyperactivity recent findings in the field of nutritional psychology have shown that nutritional interventions can help to manage symptoms of adhd a literature review found that the administration of micronutrients fatty acids or probiotics are not beneficial however the elimination of certain foods tailored to the individuals intolerances can help manage symptoms in children and adolescents while intake of certain food items are beneficial for people with adhd a high intake of refined sugars and saturated fat can worsen symptoms of adhd,0
the dorsal aortae present on the dorsal side of the embryo are initially present on both sides of the embryo they later fuse to form the basis for the aorta itself approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at the back and sides these branches form the intercostal arteries arteries of the arms and legs lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral arteries branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal suprarenal and gonadal arteries finally branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline arteries and umbilical arteries the vitelline arteries form the celiac superior and inferior mesenteric arteries of the gastrointestinal tract after birth the umbilical arteries will form the internal iliac arteries,0
the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the atlantic and the antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe,0
a psychiatrist or medical provider evaluates people through a psychiatric assessment for their mental and physical condition this usually involves interviewing the person and often obtaining information from other sources such as other health and social care professionals relatives associates law enforcement personnel emergency medical personnel and psychiatric rating scales a mental status examination is carried out and a physical examination is usually performed to establish or exclude other illnesses that may be contributing to the alleged psychiatric problems a physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of selfharm this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist especially if blood tests and medical imaging are performed,0
the climate systems response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks which either amplify or dampen the change selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net effect of clouds the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue raising climate sensitivity,0
a nature nanotechnology study suggested that some forms of carbon nanotubes could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities anthony seaton of the institute of occupational medicine in edinburgh scotland who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said we know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma so those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully in the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments paull and lyons 2008 have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food a newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs,0
the discipline of surgery was put on a sound scientific footing during the age of enlightenment in europe an important figure in this regard was the scottish surgical scientist john hunter generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery he brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around europe for the quality of his research and his written works hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch refusing to rely on the testimonies of others he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter to aid comparative analysis he built up a collection of over 13000 specimens of separate organ systems from the simplest plants and animals to humanscitation needed,0
the concepts of personalised medicine can be applied to new and transformative approaches to health care personalised health care is based on the dynamics of systems biology and uses predictive tools to evaluate health risks and to design personalised health plans to help patients mitigate risks prevent disease and to treat it with precision when it occurs the concepts of personalised health care are receiving increasing acceptance with the veterans administration committing to personalised proactive patient driven care for all veterans in some instances personalised health care can be tailored to the markup of the disease causing agent instead of the patients genetic markup examples are drug resistant bacteria or viruses,0
an example of the first case is the theory of distributions introduced by laurent schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics which became immediately an important tool of pure mathematical analysis an example of the second case is the decidability of the firstorder theory of the real numbers a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by alfred tarski with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high for getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities george collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry,0
mathematical reasoning requires rigor this means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of inference rulese without any use of empirical evidence and intuitionf rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics but in mathematics the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere despite mathematics concision rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express such as the 255page feitthompson theoremg the emergence of computerassisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expandh the result of this trend is a philosophy of the quasiempiricist proof that can not be considered infallible but has a probability attached to it,0
exclusionary diets are diets with certain groups or specific types of food avoided either due to health considerations or by choice many do not eat food from animal sources to varying degrees eg flexitarianism pescetarianism vegetarianism and veganism for health reasons issues surrounding morality or to reduce their personal impact on the environment eg environmental vegetarianism people on a balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can obtain adequate nutrition but may need to specifically focus on consuming specific nutrients such as protein iron calcium zinc and vitamin b12 raw foodism and intuitive eating are other approaches to dietary choices education income local availability and mental health are all major factors for dietary choices,0
an ion is a charged species an atom or a molecule that has lost or gained one or more electrons when an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons the atom is a positively charged ion or cation when an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts such as the na and cl ions forming sodium chloride or nacl examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acidbase reactions are hydroxide oh and phosphate po43,0

vegetarianism in ancient indiathroughout the whole country the people do not kill any living creature nor drink intoxicating liquor nor eat onions or garlic the only exception is that of the chandalas that is the name for those who are held to be wicked men and live apart from others  in that country they do not keep pigs and fowls and do not sell live cattle in the markets there are no butchers shops and no dealers in intoxicating drink in buying and selling commodities they use cowries only the chandalas are fishermen and hunters and sell flesh meat,0
the validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof which could theoretically be done automatically by a computer program this does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work on the contrary many important mathematical results theorems are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process an extreme example is aperys theorem roger apery provided only the ideas for a proof and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians,0
in 2017 a case study was undertaken by a team of researchers to explore the health implications linked to the land application of biosolids within the framework of one health this investigation encompassed the one health study design across all three health domains revealing certain limitations encountered when applying one health research in practical settings these obstacles encompass among others the necessity for enhanced collaborations spanning different fields and administrative hurdles the enhancement of sciencedriven risk management strategies and the augmentation of workforce and research infrastructure capabilities particularly in developing nations moreover notable impediments to the execution of one health research may continue if funding agencies fail to establish effective mechanisms to bolster interdisciplinary one health research,0
early nutritional scientists such as the german carl von voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body because it was generally believed that flesh makes flesh around 1862 karl heinrich ritthausen isolated the amino acid glutamic acid thomas burr osborne compiled a detailed review of the vegetable proteins at the connecticut agricultural experiment station osborne alongside lafayette mendel established several nutritionally essential amino acids in feeding experiments with laboratory rats diets lacking an essential amino acid stunts the rats growth consistent with liebigs law of the minimum the final essential amino acid to be discovered threonine was identified by william cumming rose,0
psychological testing has ancient origins dating as far back as 2200 bc in the examinations for the chinese civil service written exams began during the han dynasty 202 bc  ad 220 by 1370 the chinese system required a stratified series of tests involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics the system was ended in 1906 412 in europe mental assessment took a different approach with theories of physiognomyjudgment of character based on the facedescribed by aristotle in 4th century bc greece physiognomy remained current through the enlightenment and added the doctrine of phrenology a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy 423,0
organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen with the exception of water nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms enabling it to form diverse large and complex molecules for example a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide co2 or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide co moreover carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carboncarbon bonds such as octane or ringlike structures such as glucose,0
however after the 1966 international covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present leading to the first ever world food conference that was held in 1974 in rome italy the universal declaration on the eradication of hunger and malnutrition was a un resolution adopted november 16 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 world food conference this nonlegally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger,0
nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a daytoday basis but also the ways in which and why they diet and exercise fad diets are popular in todays society and they usually play heavily on potential customers ideals about what they should weigh or look like these diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a persons particular food intake that supposedly will result in weight loss people become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen however these claims are not always founded in scientific research,0
embedded machine learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing thereby reducing the risk of data breaches privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques such as hardware acceleration approximate computing and model optimization common optimization techniques include pruning quantization knowledge distillation lowrank factorization network architecture search and parameter sharing,0
there is ample evidence for the active experiencedependent reorganization of the synaptic networks of the brain involving multiple interrelated structures including the cerebral cortex the specific details of how this process occurs at the molecular and ultrastructural levels are topics of active neuroscience research the way experience can influence the synaptic organization of the brain is also the basis for a number of theories of brain function including the general theory of mind and neural darwinism the concept of neuroplasticity is also central to theories of memory and learning that are associated with experiencedriven alteration of synaptic structure and function in studies of classical conditioning in invertebrate animal models such as aplysia,0
more specific and widely reaching laws legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology they will have to be fully agreed upon for example will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too or could there be a limited use telehealth licence would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions or only some who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help  would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times which state city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred,0
according to the racial and ethnic approaches to community health reach a national cdc program nonhispanic blacks currently have the highest rates of obesity 48 and risk of newly diagnosed diabetes is 77 higher among nonhispanic blacks 66 higher among hispanicslatinos and 18 higher among asian americans compared to nonhispanic whites current us population projections predict that more than half of americans will belong to a minority group by 2044 without targeted preventive interventions medical costs from chronic disease inequities will become unsustainable broadening health policies designed to improve delivery of preventive services for minority populations may help reduce substantial medical costs caused by inequities in health care resulting in a return on investmentcitation needed,0
in the european union there are certifying entities named notified bodies accredited by the european member states the notified bodies must ensure the effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class i devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing once a product has passed all the steps required by the medical device directive the device is entitled to bear a ce marking indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended and therefore it can be marketed within the european union area,0
restricting population size is a proposed solution to malnutrition thomas malthus argues that population growth can be controlled by natural disasters and by voluntary limits through moral restraint robert chapman suggests that government policies are a necessary ingredient for curtailing global population growth the united nations recognizes that poverty and malnutrition as well as the environment are interdependent and complementary with population growth according to the world health organization family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy environment and national and regional development efforts however more than 200 million women worldwide lack adequate access to family planning services,0
minerals are the exogenous chemical elements indispensable for life four minerals  carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen  are essential for life but are so ubiquitous in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals the need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein which is composed of nitrogencontaining amino acids sulfur is essential but for humans not identified as having a recommended intake per se instead recommended intakes are identified for the sulfurcontaining amino acids methionine and cysteine there are dietary supplements that provide sulfur such as taurine and methylsulfonylmethane,0
"humanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school it stands for respect for the worth of persons respect for differences of approach openmindedness as to acceptable methods and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior as a third force in contemporary psychology it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems eg love creativity self growth organism basic needgratification selfactualization higher values being becoming spontaneity play humor affection naturalness warmth egotranscendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts.",0
several phenomena become pronounced as system size these include statistical mechanical effects as well as quantum mechanical effects for example the quantum size effect in which the electronic properties of solids alter along with reductions in particle size such effects do not apply at macro or micro dimensions however quantum effects can become significant when nanometer scales additionally physical mechanical electrical optical etc properties change versus macroscopic systems one example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical thermal and catalytic properties of materials diffusion and reactions can be different as well systems with fast ion transport are referred to as nanoionics the mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in research,0
"as public health practitioners epidemiologists work in a number of different settings some epidemiologists work in the field ie in the community commonlyaccording to whom in a public health service and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreakscitation needed others work for nonprofit organizations universities hospitals or larger government entities eg state and local health departments in the united states ministries of health doctors without borders the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the health protection agency, the world health organization (who), or the public health agency of canada. epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations (e.g., pharmaceutical and medical device companies) in groups such as market research or clinical development.",0
population genomics has developed as a popular field of research where genomic sequencing methods are used to conduct largescale comparisons of dna sequences among populations  beyond the limits of genetic markers such as shortrange pcr products or microsatellites traditionally used in population genetics population genomics studies genomewide effects to improve our understanding of microevolution so that we may learn the phylogenetic history and demography of a population population genomic methods are used for many different fields including evolutionary biology ecology biogeography conservation biology and fisheries management similarly landscape genomics has developed from landscape genetics to use genomic methods to identify relationships between patterns of environmental and genetic variation,0
when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate some of their offspring become longlived memory cells throughout the lifetime of an animal these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again tcells recognize pathogens by small proteinbased infection signals called antigens that bind directly to tcell surface receptors bcells use the protein immunoglobulin to recognize pathogens by their antigens this is adaptive because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges immunological memory can be in the form of either passive shortterm memory or active longterm memory,0
activities of daily living adl are fundamental skills needed to care for oneself including feeding personal hygiene toileting transferring and ambulating instrumental activities of daily living iadl describe more complex skills needed to allow oneself to live independently in a community including cooking housekeeping managing ones finances and medications routine monitoring of adl and iadl is an important functional assessment used by clinicians to determine the extent of support and care to provide to elderly adults and their caregivers it serves as a qualitative measurement of function over time and predicts the need for alternative living arrangements or models of care including senior housing apartments skilled nursing facilities palliative hospice or homebased care,0
per the who people with fasting glucose levels from 61 to 69 mmoll 110 to 125 mgdl are considered to have impaired fasting glucose people with plasma glucose at or above 78 mmoll 140 mgdl but not over 111 mmoll 200 mgdl two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load are considered to have impaired glucose tolerance of these two prediabetic states the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to fullblown diabetes mellitus as well as cardiovascular disease the american diabetes association ada since 2003 uses a slightly different range for impaired fasting glucose of 56 to 69 mmoll 100 to 125 mgdl).,0
public health was born neither in europe nor as a response to the industrial revolution preventive health interventions are attested almost anywhere historical communities have left their mark in southeast asia for instance ayurvedic medicine and subsequently buddhism fostered occupational dietary and sexual regimens that promised balanced bodies lives and communities a notion strongly present in traditional chinese medicine as well among the mayans aztecs and other early civilizations in the americas population centers pursued hygienic programs including by holding medicinal herbal markets and among aboriginal australians techniques for preserving and protecting water and food sources microzoning to reduce pollution and fire risks and screens to protect people against flies were common even in temporary camps,0
in most countries there is a mix of all five models but this varies across countries and over time within countries aside from financing mechanisms an important question should always be how much to spend on health care for the purposes of comparison this is often expressed as the percentage of gdp spent on health care in oecd countries for every extra 1000 spent on health care life expectancy falls by 04 years a similar correlation is seen from the analysis carried out each year by bloomberg clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health systems performance but equally the notion that more funding is better is not supportedcitation needed,0
in hong kong a computerized patient record system called the clinical management system cms has been developed by the hospital authority since 1994 this system has been deployed at all the sites of the authority 40 hospitals and 120 clinics it is used for up to 2 million transactions daily by 30000 clinical staff the comprehensive records of 7 million patients are available online in the electronic patient record epr with data integrated from all sites since 2004 radiology image viewing has been added to the epr with radiography images from any ha site being available as part of the epr,0
among the many varieties of microorganisms relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect the appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depend upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen however a hosts immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses  either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens,0
fao works closely with woah formerly oie and who referred to all together as the tripartite organizations who was a partner in the 2008 establishment of a strategic one health framework for approaching global health problems in september 2017 a feature page for one health was included on the who website defining one health and highlighting important topic areas such as food safety zoonotic disease and antimicrobial resistance woah headquartered in paris france was also a partner in establishing a strategic one health framework in 2008 woah works to maintain transparency surrounding global animal disease collect and distribute veterinary information publish international trade standards for animals animal products improve veterinary services globally and to promote animal welfare and food safety,0
in the 1940s an emigrant md from austria named hans kraus began testing children in the us and europe for what he termed muscular fitness in other words muscular functionality through his testing he found children in the us to be far less physically capable than european children kraus published some alarming papers in various journals and got the attention of some powerful people including a senator from pennsylvania who took the findings to president dwight d eisenhower president eisenhower was shocked he set up a series of conferences and committees then in july 1956 eisenhower established the presidents council on youth fitness,0
a number of physicians in the byzantine empire studied geriatrics with doctors like atius of amida evidently specializing in the field alexander of tralles viewed the process of aging as a natural and inevitable form of marasmus caused by the loss of moisture in body tissuecitation needed the works of atius describe the mental and physical symptoms of aging theophilus protospatharius and joannes actuarius also discussed the topic in their medical works byzantine physicians typically drew on the works of oribasius and recommended that elderly patients consume a diet rich in foods that provide heat and moisture they also recommended frequent bathing massaging rest and lowintensity exercise regimens,0
pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused pharmacology a biomedical science deals with the research discovery and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals in contrast pharmacy a health services profession is concerned with the application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role in either field the primary contrast between the two is their distinctions between directpatient care pharmacy practice and the scienceoriented research field driven by pharmacology,0
children can greatly benefit from a structured bedtime routine this can look differently among families but will generally consist of a set of rituals such as reading a bedtime story a bath brushing teeth and can also include a show of affection from the parent to the child such as a hug or kiss before bed a bedtime routine will also include a consistent time that the child is expected to be in bed ready for sleep having a reliable bedtime routine can help improve a childs quality of sleep as well as prepare them to make and keep healthy sleep hygiene habits in the future,0
changing one component of a system may affect other components or the whole system it may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior for systems that learn and adapt the growth and the degree of adaptation depend upon how well the system is engaged with its environment and other contexts influencing its organization some systems support other systems maintaining the other system to prevent failure the goals of systems theory are to model a systems dynamics constraints conditions and relations and to elucidate principles such as purpose measure methods tools that can be discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting and in a wide range of fields for achieving optimized equifinality,0
multiple genes collectively influence the likelihood of developing many common and complex diseases personalised medicine can also be used to predict a persons risk for a particular disease based on one or even several genes this approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk allowing the physician to initiate preventive treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient for example if it is found that a dna mutation increases a persons risk of developing type 2 diabetes this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing type 2 diabetes later in lifecitation needed,0
microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system the innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms or when damaged injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals many of which are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens innate immune defenses are nonspecific meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way this system does not confer longlasting immunity against a pathogen the innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms and the only one in plants,0
as such while the fetal pancreatic alpha and beta islet cells have fully developed and are capable of hormone synthesis during the remaining fetal maturation the islet cells are relatively immature in their capacity to produce glucagon and insulin this is thought to be a result of the relatively stable levels of fetal serum glucose concentrations achieved via maternal transfer of glucose through the placenta on the other hand the stable fetal serum glucose levels could be attributed to the absence of pancreatic signaling initiated by incretins during feeding in addition the fetal pancreatic islets cells are unable to sufficiently produce camp and rapidly degrade camp by phosphodiesterase necessary to secrete glucagon and insulin,0
the number of people diagnosed as living with diabetes has increased sharply in recent decades from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million by 2022 it affects one in seven of the adult population with type 2 diabetes accounting for more than 95 of cases these numbers have already risen beyond earlier projections of 783 million adults by 2045 the prevalence of the disease continues to increase most dramatically in low and middleincome nations rates are similar in women and men with diabetes being the seventh leading cause of death globally the global expenditure on diabetesrelated healthcare is an estimated us760 billion a year,0
as continual research on the properties of supplements accumulates databases or fact sheets for various supplements are updated regularly including the dietary supplement label database dietary supplement ingredient database and dietary supplement facts sheets of the united states in canada where a license is issued when a supplement product has been proven by the manufacturer and government to be safe effective and of sufficient quality for its recommended use an eightdigit natural product number is assigned and recorded in a licensed natural health products database the european food safety authority maintains a compendium of botanical ingredients used in manufacturing of dietary supplements,0
chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy the speed of a chemical reaction at given temperature t is related to the activation energy e by the boltzmanns population factor e  e  k t displaystyle eekt  that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius equation the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat light electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound,0
agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the neolithic revolution through early biotechnology the earliest farmers selected and bred the bestsuited crops eg those with the highest yields to produce enough food to support a growing population as crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain it was discovered that specific organisms and their byproducts could effectively fertilize restore nitrogen and control pests throughout the history of agriculture farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants  one of the first forms of biotechnologyclarification needed,0
chemical kinetics is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces when applied to materials science it deals with how a material changes with time moves from nonequilibrium to equilibrium state due to application of a certain field it details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape size composition and structure diffusion is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change kinetics is essential in processing of materials because among other things it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat,0
cases of veterinary vaccines used in humans have been documented whether intentional or accidental with some cases of resultant illness most notably with brucellosis however the reporting of such cases is rare and very little has been studied about the safety and results of such practices with the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics human exposure to pathogens not naturally carried in humans such as bordetella bronchiseptica has likely increased in recent years in some cases most notably rabies the parallel veterinary vaccine against a pathogen may be as much as orders of magnitude more economical than the human one,0
bacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms typically a few micrometers in length bacteria have a number of shapes ranging from spheres to rods and spirals bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on earth and are present in most of its habitats bacteria inhabit soil water acidic hot springs radioactive waste and the deep biosphere of the earths crust bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals most bacteria have not been characterised and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory,0
a quasiexperiment is a situation in which different conditions are being studied but random assignment to the different conditions is not possible investigators must work with preexisting groups of people researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the studys validity for example in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and perhaps statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level,0
during the conversion from straightchain form to the cyclic form the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen called the anomeric carbon becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations the oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring the resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers in the  anomer the oh substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side trans of the ring from the ch2oh side branch the alternative form in which the ch2oh substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side cis of the plane of the ring is called the  anomer,0
the health sector is one of europes most laborintensive industries in late 2020 it accounted for more than 21 million employment in the european union when combined with social work according to the who several countries began the covid19 pandemic with insufficient health and care professionals inappropriate skill mixtures and unequal geographical distributions these issues were worsened by the pandemic reiterating the importance of public health in the united states a history of underinvestment in public health undermined the public health workforce and support for population health long before the pandemic added to stress mental distress job dissatisfaction and accelerated departures among public health workers,0
natural killer cells nk cells are lymphocytes and a component of the innate immune system that does not directly attack invading microbes rather nk cells destroy compromised host cells such as tumor cells or virusinfected cells recognizing such cells by a condition known as missing self this term describes cells with low levels of a cellsurface marker called mhc i major histocompatibility complexa situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by nk cells because they express intact self mhc antigens those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors which essentially put the brakes on nk cells,0
supportvector machines svms also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category an svm training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces,0
for problems with all these properties the running time of grovers algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs or elements in the database as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms a general class of problems to which grovers algorithm can be applied is a boolean satisfiability problem where the database through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers an example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies,0
psychiatry was not a popular career choice among medical students even though medical school placements are rated favorably this has resulted in a significant shortage of psychiatrists in the united states and elsewhere strategies to address this shortfall have included the use of short taster placements early in the medical school curriculum and attempts to extend psychiatry services further using telemedicine technologies and other methods recently however there has been an increase in the number of medical students entering into a psychiatry residency there are several reasons for this surge including the intriguing nature of the field growing interest in genetic biomarkers involved in psychiatric diagnoses and newer pharmaceuticals on the drug market to treat psychiatric illnesses,0
drosophila circadian rhythm is through a transcriptiontranslation feedback loop the core clock mechanism consists of two interdependent feedback loops namely the pertim loop and the clkcyc loop the clkcyc loop occurs during the day and initiates the transcription of the per and tim genes but their proteins levels remain low until dusk because during daylight also activates the doubletime dbt gene dbt protein causes phosphorylation and turnover of monomeric per proteins tim is also phosphorylated by shaggy until sunset after sunset dbt disappears so that per molecules stably bind to tim pertim dimer enters the nucleus several at night and binds to clkcyc dimers bound per completely stops the transcriptional activity of clk and cyc,0
glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important tenstep pathway called glycolysis the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate this also produces a net two molecules of atp the energy currency of cells along with two reducing equivalents of converting nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized form to nadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form this does not require oxygen if no oxygen is available or the cell cannot use oxygen the nad is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate lactic acid eg in humans or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide eg in yeast other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway,0
telehealth is a modern form of health care delivery telehealth breaks away from traditional health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods traditional health is legislated through policy to ensure the safety of medical practitioners and patients consequently since telehealth is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector many organizations have started to legislate the use of telehealth into policy in new zealand the medical council has a statement about telehealth on their website this illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that telehealth will have on the health system and have started to introduce telehealth legislation to practitioners along with government,0
infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body grows and multiplies this is referred to as colonization most humans are not easily infected those with compromised or weakened immune systems have an increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections entrance to the host at hostpathogen interface generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity nose eyes genitalia anus or the microbe can enter through open wounds while a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs some pathogens grow within the host cells intracellular whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids,0
the glycemic index of a food is defined as the incremental area under the twohour blood glucose response curve auc following a 12hour fast and ingestion of a food with a certain quantity of available carbohydrate usually 50 g the auc of the test food is divided by the auc of the standard either glucose or white bread giving two different definitions and multiplied by 100 the average gi value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate the result gives a relative ranking for each tested food,0

in the 20th and 21st centuries with the advent of computer models and big data meteorology has become increasingly dependent on numerical methods and computer simulations this has greatly improved weather forecasting and climate predictions additionally meteorology has expanded to include other areas such as air quality atmospheric chemistry and climatology the advancement in observational theoretical and computational technologies has enabled ever more accurate weather predictions and understanding of weather pattern and air pollution in current time with the advancement in weather forecasting and satellite technology meteorology has become an integral part of everyday life and is used for many purposes such as aviation agriculture and disaster managementcitation needed,0
the existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed for example by the jains in india and by marcus terentius varro in ancient rome the first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds by robert hooke in 1666 but the jesuit priest athanasius kircher was likely the first to see microbes which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658 antonie van leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in the 1670s using simple microscopes of his design scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of louis pasteur and in medical microbiology robert koch,0
soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community as organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials an ecological process called bioturbation this aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production soil microorganisms are influenced by and are fed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem no single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the cambrian period other events such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils,0
women and men inhabited very different roles in natal care up to the 18th century the role of a physician was exclusively held by men who went to university an overly male institution who would theorize anatomy and the process of reproduction based on theological teaching and philosophy many beliefs about the female body and menstruation in the 17th and 18th centuries were inaccurate clearly resulting from the lack of literature about the practice 123125 many of the theories of what caused menstruation prevailed from hippocratic philosophy 16 midwives meaning with woman were those who assisted in the birth and care of both born and unborn children a position historically held mainly by women,0
the mismatch between a clinicians communication of content and a patients ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population health care professionals doctors nurses public health workers can also have poor health literacy skills such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public in addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients a well arranged layout pertinent illustrations and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature this in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients,0
comparative psychologist harry harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the university of wisconsinmadison in the 1970s the aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression harlow also devised what he called a rape rack to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture in 1974 american literary critic wayne c booth wrote that harry harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade invariably proving what we all knew in advancethat social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties he writes that harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work,0
type 1 diabetes can occur at any age and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood latent autoimmune diabetes of adults lada is the diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults it has a slower onset than the same condition in children given this difference some use the unofficial term type 15 diabetes for this condition adults with lada are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes based on age rather than a cause lada leaves adults with higher levels of insulin production than type 1 diabetes but not enough insulin production for healthy blood sugar levels,0
immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century through rapid developments in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity particularly important was the work of paul ehrlich who proposed the sidechain theory to explain the specificity of the antigenantibody reaction his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a joint nobel prize in 1908 along with the founder of cellular immunology elie metchnikoff in 1974 niels kaj jerne developed the immune network theory he shared a nobel prize in 1984 with georges j f khler and csar milstein for theories related to the immune system,0
since string theory incorporates all of the fundamental interactions including gravity many physicists hope that it will eventually be developed to the point where it fully describes our universe making it a theory of everything one of the goals of current research in string theory is to find a solution of the theory that reproduces the observed spectrum of elementary particles with a small cosmological constant containing dark matter and a plausible mechanism for cosmic inflation while there has been progress toward these goals it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of details,0
from aristotle until darwin the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging prior to the origin of species there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms their adaptations and the environment an exception is the 1789 publication natural history of selborne by gilbert white 17201793 considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology while charles darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution he was one of the founders of soil ecology and he made note of the first ecological experiment in the origin of species evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences,0
additionally the liver plays a dominant role in blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage of glucose through the metabolic pathways of glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis intestinal lipids regulate glucose homeostasis involving a gutbrainliver axis the direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increases the long chain fatty acylcoenzyme a lcfacoa levels in the upper intestines and suppresses glucose production even under subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation this interrupts the neural connection between the brain and the gut and blocks the upper intestinal lipids ability to inhibit glucose production the gutbrainliver axis and gut microbiota composition can regulate the glucose homeostasis in the liver and provide potential therapeutic methods to treat obesity and diabetes,0
origin of the term plantbased diet is attributed to cornell university nutritional biochemist t colin campbell who presented his diet research at the us national institutes of health in 1980 campbells research about a plantbased diet extended from the china project a decadelong study of dietary practices in rural china giving evidence that a diet low in animal protein and fat and high in plant foods could reduce the incidence of several diseases in 2005 campbell and his son published the china study a bestselling book emphasizing the potential health benefits of a plantbased diet campbell also used the plantbased concept to educate consumers about how eating meat had significant environmental consequences,0
molecular cloning is used to isolate and then transfer a dna sequence of interest into a plasmid vector this recombinant dna technology was first developed in the 1960s in this technique a dna sequence coding for a protein of interest is cloned using polymerase chain reaction pcr andor restriction enzymes into a plasmid expression vector the plasmid vector usually has at least 3 distinctive features an origin of replication a multiple cloning site mcs and a selective marker usually antibiotic resistance additionally upstream of the mcs are the promoter regions and the transcription start site which regulate the expression of cloned gene,0
assembly can be broadly categorized into two approaches de novo assembly for genomes which are not similar to any sequenced in the past and comparative assembly which uses the existing sequence of a closely related organism as a reference during assembly relative to comparative assembly de novo assembly is computationally difficult nphard making it less favourable for shortread ngs technologies within the de novo assembly paradigm there are two primary strategies for assembly eulerian path strategies and overlaplayoutconsensus olc strategies olc strategies ultimately try to create a hamiltonian path through an overlap graph which is an nphard problem eulerian path strategies are computationally more tractable because they try to find a eulerian path through a debruijn graph,0
advances in lipid nanotechnology were instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications another system for microrna delivery under preliminary research is nanoparticles formed by the selfassembly of two different micrornas to possibly shrink tumors one potential application is based on small electromechanical systems such as nanoelectromechanical systems being investigated for the active release of drugs and sensors for possible cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells another system of drug delivery involving nanoparticles is the use of aquasomes selfassembled nanoparticles with a nanocrystalline center a coating made of a polyhydroxyl oligomer covered in the desired drug which protects it from dehydration and conformational change,0
from the beginnings of human civilization communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level in complex preindustrialized societies interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders such as army generals the clergy or rulers great britain became a leader in the development of public health initiatives beginning in the 19th century due to the fact that it was the first modern urban nation worldwide the public health initiatives that began to emerge initially focused on sanitation for example the liverpool and london sewerage systems control of infectious diseases including vaccination and quarantine and an evolving infrastructure of various sciences eg statistics microbiology epidemiology sciences of engineering,0
the spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body but has other functions it breaks down both red and white blood cells that are spent this is why it is sometimes known as the graveyard of red blood cells a product of this digestion is the pigment bilirubin which is sent to the liver and secreted in the bile another product is iron which is used in the formation of new blood cells in the bone marrow medicine treats the spleen solely as belonging to the lymphatic system though it is acknowledged that the full range of its important functions is not yet understood 1751,0
in practice modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics some areas of study for astrophysicists include the properties of dark matter dark energy black holes and other celestial bodies and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include solar system formation and evolution stellar dynamics and evolution galaxy formation and evolution magnetohydrodynamics largescale structure of matter in the universe origin of cosmic rays general relativity special relativity and quantum and physical cosmology the physical study of the largestscale structures of the universe including string cosmology and astroparticle physics,0
humanistic psychology which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology stresses free will and selfactualization it emerged in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis the humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth selfidentity death aloneness and freedom it emphasizes subjective meaning the rejection of determinism and concern for positive growth rather than pathology some founders of the humanistic school of thought were american psychologists abraham maslow who formulated a hierarchy of human needs and carl rogers who created and developed clientcentered therapy,0
the majority of cancers some 9095 of cases are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors the remaining 510 are due to inherited genetics environmental refers to any cause that is not inherited such as lifestyle economic and behavioral factors and not merely pollution common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use 2530 diet and obesity 3035 infections 1520 radiation both ionizing and nonionizing up to 10 lack of physical activity and pollution psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancer,0
medical imaging may be indicated in pregnancy because of pregnancy complications a preexisting disease or an acquired disease in pregnancy or routine prenatal care magnetic resonance imaging mri without mri contrast agents as well as obstetric ultrasonography are not associated with any risk for the mother or the fetus and are the imaging techniques of choice for pregnant women projectional radiography ct scan and nuclear medicine imaging result some degree of ionizing radiation exposure but have with a few exceptions much lower absorbed doses than what are associated with fetal harm at higher dosages effects can include miscarriage birth defects and intellectual disability,0
the marine ecosystem is large and thus there are many subfields of marine biology most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups such as phycology invertebrate zoology and ichthyology other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in sea water and the ocean in general adaptation to a salty environment and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life a subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life and global warming and environmental issues such as carbon dioxide displacement recent marine biotechnology has focused largely on marine biomolecules especially proteins that may have uses in medicine or engineering marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire biomimetic materials,0
in april 1991 the us department of agriculture usda halted publication of its eating right pyramid due to objections raised by meat and dairy lobbying groups concerning the guides display of their products despite the usdas explanations that the guide required further research and testing it was not until one year laterafter its content was supported by additional researchthat the eating right pyramid was officially released this time even the guides graphic design was altered to appease industry concerns this incident was only one of many in which the food industry attempted to alter federal dietary recommendations in their own economic selfinterest,0
a study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999 over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by rp caplan these results showed that 47 of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress 27 of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves an eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54 of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals,0
it has been postulated that breastfeeding may also protect against type1 diabetes with research showing that formulafed infants are at an increased risk of developing islet autoantibodies individuals with type1 diabetes experience a preclinical diabetes phase characterized by autoimmunity against pancreatic islets the introduction of certain foods in the first few months of life such as berries and cereal is significantly associated with increased risk of islet autoantibody development compared to babies who are exposed to solid foods later in life while the pathogenesis behind development of autoantibodies remains largely unknown it is very probable that an epigenetic link exists between perinatal diet and risk of type1 diabetes,0
human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook grays anatomy has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format in line with modern teaching methods a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology,0
the environmental effects of climate change are broad and farreaching affecting oceans ice and weather changes may occur gradually or rapidly evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past from modelling and from modern observations since the 1950s droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in india and east asia monsoonal precipitation over the northern hemisphere has increased since 1980 the rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change,0
climate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change,0
although there are a number of health informatics organizations in australia the health informatics society of australia hisa is regarded as the major umbrella group and is a member of the international medical informatics association imia nursing informaticians were the driving force behind the formation of hisa which is now a company limited by guarantee of the members the membership comes from across the informatics spectrum that is from students to corporate affiliates hisa has a number of branches queensland new south wales victoria and western australia as well as special interest groups such as nursing nia pathology aged and community care industry and medical imaging conrick 2006,0
light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes phytochrome a phya is light labile and allows germination and deetiolation when light is scarce phytochromes be are more stable with phyb the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light the cryptochrome cry gene is also a lightsensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clocks endogenous pacemaker mechanism cryptochromes 12 involved in blueuva help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions,0
educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings the effectiveness of educational interventions the psychology of teaching and the social psychology of schools as organizations educational psychologists can be found in preschools schools of all levels including post secondary institutions community organizations and learning centers government or private research firms and independent or private consultant the work of developmental psychologists such as lev vygotsky jean piaget and jerome bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as north america australia and new zealand,0
the dna methyltransferases dnmt3a1 dnmt3a2 and dnmt3b can all methylate cytosines see image this section at cpg sites in or near the promoters of genes as shown by manzo et al these three dna methyltransferases differ in their genomic binding locations and dna methylation activity at different regulatory sites manzo et al located 3970 genome regions exclusively enriched for dnmt3a1 3838 regions for dnmt3a2 and 3432 regions for dnmt3b when dnmt3a2 is newly induced as an ieg when neurons are activated many new cytosine methylations occur presumably in the target regions of dnmt3a2 oliviera et al found that the neuronal activityinducible ieg levels of dnmt3a2 in the hippocampus determined the ability to form longterm memories,0
adaptation is the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects 5 without additional mitigation adaptation cannot avert the risk of severe widespread and irreversible impacts more severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation which can be prohibitively expensive the capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations and developing countries generally have less the first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low and middleincome countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity but progress is slow many countries have implemented adaptation policies however there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance,0
most sources of electromagnetic radiation contain a large number of atoms or molecules that emit light the orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated in which case the light is said to be unpolarised if there is partial correlation between the emitters the light is partially polarised if the polarisation is consistent across the spectrum of the source partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component and a completely polarised one one may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarisation and the parameters of the polarisation ellipse,0
"a carbohydrate krbohadret is a biomolecule consisting of carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o atoms usually with a hydrogenoxygen atom ratio of 21 as in water and thus with the empirical formula cmh2on where m may or may not be different from n which does not mean the h has covalent bonds with o for example with ch2o h has a covalent bond with c but not with o however not all carbohydrates conform to this precise stoichiometric definition eg uronic acids deoxysugars such as fucose, nor are all chemicals that do conform to this definition automatically classified as carbohydrates (e.g., formaldehyde and acetic acid).",0
overnutrition caused by overeating is also a form of malnutrition in the united states more than half of all adults are now overweighta condition that like hunger increases susceptibility to disease and disability reduces worker productivity and lowers life expectancy overeating is much more common in the united states since most people have adequate access to food many parts of the world have access to a surplus of nonnutritious food increased sedentary lifestyles also contribute to overnutrition yale university psychologist kelly brownell calls this a toxic food environment where fat and sugarladen foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods,0
restricting population size is a proposed solution to malnutrition thomas malthus argues that population growth can be controlled by natural disasters and by voluntary limits through moral restraint robert chapman suggests that government policies are a necessary ingredient for curtailing global population growth the united nations recognizes that poverty and malnutrition as well as the environment are interdependent and complementary with population growth according to the world health organization family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy environment and national and regional development efforts however more than 200 million women worldwide lack adequate access to family planning services,0
when compared to psychoactive medications review studies have found cbt alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression and borderline personality disorder some research suggests that cbt is most effective when combined with medication for treating mental disorders such as major depressive disorder cbt is recommended as the first line of treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents including aggression and conduct disorder researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults along with interpersonal psychotherapy ipt cbt is recommended in treatment guidelines as a psychosocial treatment of choice recommended by american psychiatric association american psychological association british national health service,0
tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period there is one living species sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings fenestrae on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi the tuatara has a welldeveloped parietal eye on its forehead,0
artificial arms and legs or prosthetics are intended to restore a degree of normal function to amputees mechanical devices that allow amputees to walk again or continue to use two hands have probably been in use since ancient times the most notable one being the simple peg leg since then the development of artificial limbs has progressed rapidly new plastics and other materials such as carbon fiber have allowed artificial limbs to become stronger and lighter limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic prostheses can roughly be categorized as upper and lowerextremity and can take many shapes and sizes,0
in the early 20th century mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by ronald ross janet laneclaypon anderson gray mckendrick and others in a parallel development during the 1920s germanswiss pathologist max askanazy and others founded the international society for geographical pathology to systematically investigate the geographical pathology of cancer and other noninfectious diseases across populations in different regions after world war ii richard doll and other nonpathologists joined the field and advanced methods to study cancer a disease with patterns and mode of occurrences that could not be suitably studied with the methods developed for epidemics of infectious diseases geography pathology eventually combined with infectious disease epidemiology to make the field that is epidemiology today,0
the terms mental health promotion and prevention have often been confused promotion is defined as intervening to optimize positive mental health by addressing determinants of positive mental health ie protective factors before a specific mental health problem has been identified with the ultimate goal of improving the positive mental health of the population mental health prevention is defined as intervening to minimize mental health problems ie risk factors by addressing determinants of mental health problems before a specific mental health problem has been identified in the individual group or population of focus with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of future mental health problems in the population,0
the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brainr they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in 1943 and turings influential 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible,0
the first geological map of the us was produced in 1809 by william maclure in 1807 maclure commenced the selfimposed task of making a geological survey of the united states almost every state in the union was traversed and mapped by him the allegheny mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times the results of his unaided labours were submitted to the american philosophical society in a memoir entitled observations on the geology of the united states explanatory of a geological map and published in the societys transactions together with the nations first geological map this antedates william smiths geological map of england by six years although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks,0
estuaries are also near shore and influenced by the tides an estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea estuaries form a transition zone between freshwater river environments and saltwater maritime environments they are subject both to marine influencessuch as tides waves and the influx of saline waterand to riverine influencessuch as flows of fresh water and sediment the shifting flows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world,0
selection bias occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest for instance it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates sackett d cites the example of seltzer et al in which 85 of non smokers and 67 of smokers returned mailed questionnaires such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups,0
some strains of lab may affect pathogens by means of competitive inhibition ie by competing for growth and some evidence suggests they may improve immune function by increasing the number of igaproducing plasma cells and increasing or improving phagocytosis as well as increasing the proportion of t lymphocytes and natural killer cells lab products might aid in the treatment of acute diarrhea and possibly affect rotavirus infections in children and travelers diarrhea in adults but no products are approved for such indications there are weak evidence probiotics might lower the incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults they were better than placebo or no treatment,0
traditionally the basic level of annotation is using blast for finding similarities and then annotating genomes based on homologues more recently additional information is added to the annotation platform the additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation some databases use genome context information similarity scores experimental data and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their subsystems approach other databases eg ensembl rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline structural annotation consists of the identification of genomic elements primarily orfs and their localisation or gene structure functional annotation consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements,0
regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space,0
reproductive age patients who develop cancer often receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy which damages oocytes and leads to early menopause an artificial human ovary has been developed at brown university with selfassembled microtissues created using novel 3d petri dish technology in a study funded and conducted by the nih in 2017 scientists were successful in printing 3d ovaries and implanting them in sterile mice in the future scientists hope to replicate this in larger animals as well as humans the artificial ovary will be used for the purpose of in vitro maturation of immature oocytes and the development of a system to study the effect of environmental toxins on folliculogenesis,0
the word psychology derives from the greek word psyche for spirit or soul the latter part of the word psychology derives from  logia which means study or research the word psychology was first used in the renaissance in its latin form psychiologia it was first employed by the croatian humanist and latinist marko maruli in his book psichiologia de ratione animae humanae psychology on the nature of the human soul in the decade 15101520 the earliest known reference to the word psychology in english was by steven blankaart in 1694 in the physical dictionary the dictionary refers to anatomy which treats the body and psychology which treats of the soul,0
polyphenols such as lignin are larger molecules macromolecules their upper molecular weight limit is about 800 daltons which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes so that they can reach intracellular sites of action or remain as pigments once the cell senesces hence many larger polyphenols are biosynthesized in situ from smaller polyphenols to nonhydrolyzable tannins and remain undiscovered in the plant matrix most polyphenols contain repeating phenolic moieties of pyrocatechol resorcinol pyrogallol and phloroglucinol connected by esters hydrolyzable tannins or more stable cc bonds nonhydrolyzable condensed tannins proanthocyanidins are mostly polymeric units of catechin and epicatechin,0
cervical cancer ranks among the top three most common cancers among women in latin america subsaharan africa and parts of asia cervical cytology screening aims to detect abnormal lesions in the cervix so that women can undergo treatment prior to the development of cancer given that high quality screening and followup care has been shown to reduce cervical cancer rates by up to 80 most developed countries now encourage sexually active women to undergo a pap test every 35 years finland and iceland have developed effective organized programs with routine monitoring and have managed to significantly reduce cervical cancer mortality while using fewer resources than unorganized opportunistic programs such as those in the united states or canada,0
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most nonwestern contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude lvistrauss the way of the masks 1982 or geertzs 'art as cultural system' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.[citation needed],0
quantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings such research can only assess a limited range of shortterm phenomena some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled but more ecologically valid field experiments as well other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data the statistical methods research psychologists employ include the pearson productmoment correlation coefficient the analysis of variance multiple linear regression logistic regression structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling the measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs,0
othniel c marsh americas first palaeontologist was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support darwins theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse in 1877 marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science providing a demonstrative argument for evolution for the first time marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans sparing no detail he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms the significance of this speech was immediately recognised by the scientific community and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals,0
divisions still exist within the field with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a cult of empiricism which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences 367 feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of historically mostly male researchers jean grimshaw for example argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior 120,0
critical care pharmacists work with the medical team in many aspects but some include monitoring serum concentrations of medication past medication use current medication use and medication allergies their typically round with the team but it may differ by institution some pharmacist after attaining their doctorate or pharmacy may pursue additional training in a postgraduate residency and become certified as critical care pharmacists pharmacists help manage all aspects of drug therapy and may pursue additional credentialing in critical care medicine as bcccp by the board of pharmaceutical specialties many critical care pharmacists are a part of the multiprofessional society of critical care medicine inclusion of pharmacist decreases drug reactions and poor outcomes for patients,0
statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk expected loss of a statistical action such as using a procedure in for example parameter estimation hypothesis testing and selecting the best in these traditional areas of mathematical statistics a statisticaldecision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function like expected loss or cost under specific constraints for example designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence because of its use of optimization the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences such as operations research control theory and mathematical economics,0
there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines this is especially true in the united states where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated,0
in ireland the royal college of surgeons of ireland grants membership mrcsi ophth and fellowship frcsi ophth qualifications in conjunction with the irish college of ophthalmologists total postgraduate training involves an intern year a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 45 years of higher surgical training clinical training takes place within public health service executivefunded hospitals in dublin sligo limerick galway waterford and cork a minimum of 85 years of training is required before eligibility to work in consultant posts some trainees take extra time to obtain msc md or phd degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the uk australia and the united states,0
the uk general medical councils ethical guidelines indicate that the council does not require consent prior to making recordings of xray images however the same guidance indicates that the images and recordings need to be anonimized and acknowledges that in deciding whether a recording is anonymised one should bear in mind that apparently insignificant details may still be capable of identifying a patient as such one should be particularly careful about the anonymity of a recordings of an xray image before using or publishing them without consent in journals and other learning materials whether they are printed or in an electronic format,0
further each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified the order is domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species the scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species for example humans are listed as homo sapiens homo is the genus and sapiens the specific epithet both of them combined make up the species name when writing the scientific name of an organism it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase additionally the entire term may be italicized or underlined,0
one important example of a matrix model is the bfss matrix model proposed by tom banks willy fischler stephen shenker and leonard susskind in 1997 this theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices in their original paper these authors showed among other things that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by elevendimensional supergravity these calculations led them to propose that the bfss matrix model is exactly equivalent to mtheory the bfss matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of mtheory and a tool for investigating the properties of mtheory in a relatively simple setting,0
helen b taussig is known as the founder of pediatric cardiology she became famous through her work with tetralogy congenital heart defect in which oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enters the circulatory system resulting from a ventricular septal defect vsd right beneath the aorta this condition causes newborns to have a bluishtint cyanosis and have a deficiency of oxygen to their tissues hypoxemia she worked with alfred blalock and vivien thomas at the johns hopkins hospital where they experimented with dogs to look at how they would attempt to surgically cure these blue babies they eventually figured out how to do just that by the anastomosis of the systemic artery to the pulmonary artery and called this the blalocktaussig shunt,0
a major criticism has been that clinical studies of cbt efficacy or any psychotherapy are not doubleblind ie either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind to the type of treatment they may be singleblinded ie the rater may not know the treatment the patient received but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given two out of three of the persons involved in the trial ie all of the persons involved in the treatment are unblinded the patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in,0
a compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system the names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system when a compound has more than one component then they are divided into two classes the electropositive and the electronegative components in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number,0
reptiles which inhabit or frequent the sea include sea turtles sea snakes terrapins the marine iguana and the saltwater crocodile most extant marine reptiles except for some sea snakes are oviparous and need to return to land to lay their eggs thus most species excluding sea turtles spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean despite their marine adaptations most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land around islands especially waters that are somewhat sheltered as well as near estuaries some extinct marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs evolved to be viviparous and had no requirement to return to land,0
a lack of good sleep in amount or quality is documented as increasing cardiovascular risk in both adults and teens recommendations suggest that infants typically need 12 or more hours of sleep per day adolescents at least eight or nine hours and adults seven or eight about onethird of adult americans get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night and in a study of teenagers just 22 percent of those studied got enough sleep many of whom did not get good quality sleep studies have shown that short sleepers getting less than seven hours sleep per night have a 10 percent to 30 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease,0
the former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease these types of studies in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patients history may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis using the data from the series analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors these can include casecontrol studies or prospective studies a casecontrol study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series a prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the diseases natural history,0
on an international scale the world health organization who and the international labour organization ilo have begun focusing on labor environments in developing nations with projects such as healthy cities many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in osh leads to increased costs due to workrelated illnesses and accidentscitation needed the ilo estimates that workrelated illness and accidents cost up to 10 of gdp in latin america compared with just 26 to 38 in the eu there is continued use of asbestos a notorious hazard in some developing countries so asbestosrelated disease is expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the futurecitation needed,0
breastfeeding is noted as one of the most costeffective medical interventions benefiting child health while there are considerable differences among developed and developing countries there are universal determinants of whether a mother breastfeeds or uses formula these include income employment social norms and access to healthcare many newly made mothers face financial barriers communitybased healthcare workers have helped to alleviate these barriers while also providing a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospitalbased medical care recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995 to 2010 show that exclusive breastfeeding rates have risen globally from 33 to 39 despite the growth rates medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding,0
from the greek  gen gene gamma epsilon nu epsilon meaning become create creation birth and subsequent variants genealogy genesis genetics genic genomere genotype genus etc while the word genome from the german genom attributed to hans winkler was in use in english as early as 1926 the term genomics was coined by tom roderick a geneticist at the jackson laboratory bar harbor maine over beers with jim womack tom shows and stephen obrien at a meeting held in maryland on the mapping of the human genome in 1986. first as the name for a new journal and then as a whole new science discipline.,0
genetic engineering could be used to cure diseases but also to change physical appearance metabolism and even improve physical capabilities and mental faculties such as memory and intelligence ethical claims about germline engineering include beliefs that every fetus has a right to remain genetically unmodified that parents hold the right to genetically modify their offspring and that every child has the right to be born free of preventable diseases for parents genetic engineering could be seen as another child enhancement technique to add to diet exercise education training cosmetics and plastic surgery another theorist claims that moral concerns limit but do not prohibit germline engineering,0
rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated microorganism to an immune system which would constitute a wholeagent vaccine a subunit vaccine uses a fragment of it to create an immune response one example is the subunit vaccine against hepatitis b which is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast other examples include the gardasil viruslike particle human papillomavirus hpv vaccine the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus and edible algae vaccines a subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization,0
coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved an extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects such as bees termites and ants where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce on an even smaller scale the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism which then supports a small number of the animals germ cells to produce offspring here somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow remain as they are or die if cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately their uncontrolled growth causes cancer,0
the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms the composition of the earths atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health crops and ecosystems examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain photochemical smog and global warming atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated,0
in the united states and canada dietary supplements are considered a subset of foods and are regulated accordingly the us food and drug administration fda monitors supplement products for accuracy in advertising and labeling dietary supplements are regulated by the fda as food products subject to compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp and labeling with sciencebased ingredient descriptions and advertising when finding cgmp or advertising violations fda warning letters are used to notify manufacturers of impending enforcement action including search and seizure injunction and financial penalties examples between 2016 and 2018 of cgmp and advertising violations by dietary supplement manufacturers included several with illegal compositions or advertising of vitamins and minerals,0
there are many aspects of politics and evidence that can influence the decision of a government private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy evidencebased policy relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as randomized controlled trials to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes most political debates surround personal health care policies especially those that seek to reform healthcare delivery and can typically be categorized as either philosophical or economic philosophical debates center around questions about individual rights ethics and government authority while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costscitation needed,0
archaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium bce in ancient babylonia comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient near east and then for the grecoroman world starting around 300 bce the oldest known mathematics textbook is the rhind papyrus dated from c 1650 bce in egypt due to a scarcity of books mathematical teachings in ancient india were communicated using memorized oral tradition since the vedic period c 1500  c 500 bce in imperial china during the tang dynasty 618907 ce a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy,0
fats are one of the three main macronutrient groups in human diet along with carbohydrates and proteins and the main components of common food products like milk butter tallow lard salt pork and cooking oils they are a major and dense source of food energy for many animals and play important structural and metabolic functions in most living beings including energy storage waterproofing and thermal insulation the human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not watersoluble,0
another pathway for effects of meal timing on metabolism lies in the influence of the circadian rhythm over the endocrine system especially on glucose metabolism and leptin preliminary studies found that eating when melatonin is secreted  during darkness and commonly when sleeping at night  is associated with increased glucose levels in young healthy adults and obesity and cardiovascular disorders in less healthy individuals reviews on obesity prevention concluded that meal timing appears as a new potential target in weight control strategies and suggest that timing and content of food intake physical activity and sleep may be modulated to counteract circadian and metabolic genetic predispositions to obesity,0
alan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks,0
the basic unit of information in quantum computing the qubit or quantum bit serves the same function as the bit in classical computing however unlike a classical bit which can be in one of two states a binary a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two basis states a state that is in an abstract sense between the two basis states when measuring a qubit the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit if a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results the design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly,0
iso 22000 is a standard developed by the international organization for standardization dealing with food safety this is a general derivative of iso 9000 the iso 22000 international standard specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that involves interactive communication system management prerequisite programs and hazard analysis and critical control points principles iso 22000 was first published in 2005 it is the culmination of all previous attempts from many sources and areas of food safety concern to provide an end product that is safe as possible from pathogens and other contaminants every 5 years standards are reviewed to determine whether a revision is necessary to ensure that the standards remain as relevant and useful to businesses as possible,0
type 1 accounts for 5 to 10 of diabetes cases and is the most common type of diabetes diagnosed in patients under 20 years however the older term juvenileonset diabetes is no longer used as onset in adulthood is possible the disease is characterized by loss of the insulinproducing beta cells of the pancreatic islets leading to severe insulin deficiency and can be further classified as immunemediated or idiopathic without known cause the majority of cases are immunemediated in which a t cellmediated autoimmune attack causes loss of beta cells and thus insulin deficiency patients often have irregular and unpredictable blood sugar levels due to very low insulin and an impaired counterresponse to hypoglycemia,0
the effects of exercise training appear to be heterogeneous across nonmammalian species as examples exercise training of salmon showed minor improvements of endurance and a forced swimming regimen of yellowtail amberjack and rainbow trout accelerated their growth rates and altered muscle morphology favorable for sustained swimming crocodiles alligators and ducks showed elevated aerobic capacity following exercise training no effect of endurance training was found in most studies of lizards although one study did report a training effect in lizards sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity and muscular damage from overtraining occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise,0
it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations,0
henri laborit one of the founders of modern neuropsychopharmacology carried out experiments in the 1970s that showed that illness quickly occurred when there was inhibition of action in rats rats in exactly the same stressful situations but whom were not inhibited in their behavior those who could flee or fighteven if fighting is completely ineffective had no negative health consequences he proposed that psychosomatic illnesses in humans largely have their source in the constraints that society puts on individuals in order to maintain hierarchical structures of dominance the film my american uncle directed by alain resnais and influenced by laborit explores the relationship between self and society and the effects of the inhibition of action,0
all organisms on earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool current species are a stage in the process of evolution with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events the common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms first they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation second the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms but organisms that share morphological similarities third vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits fourth organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups similar to a family tree,0
precision medicine often involves the application of panomic analysis and systems biology to analyze the cause of an individual patients disease at the molecular level and then to utilize targeted treatments possibly in combination to address that individual patients disease process the patients response is then tracked as closely as possible often using surrogate measures such as tumor load versus true outcomes such as fiveyear survival rate and the treatment finely adapted to the patients response the branch of precision medicine that addresses cancer is referred to as precision oncology the field of precision medicine that is related to psychiatric disorders and mental health is called precision psychiatry,0
a replication crisis in psychology has emerged many notable findings in the field have not been replicated some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results systematic efforts including efforts by the reproducibility project of the center for open science to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as twothirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology in studies and journals than social psychology and subfields of differential psychology other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis including clinical psychology developmental psychology and a field closely related to psychology educational research,0
a finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth the finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particleinabox problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well instead the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well another related problem is that of the rectangular potential barrier which furnishes a model for the quantum tunneling effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy,0
artificial intelligence is providing a paradigm shift toward precision medicine machine learning algorithms are used for genomic sequence and to analyze and draw inferences from the vast amounts of data patients and healthcare institutions recorded in every moment ai techniques are used in precision cardiovascular medicine to understand genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases improve the quality of patient care enable costeffectiveness and reduce readmission and mortality rates a 2021 paper reported that machine learning was able to predict the outcomes of phase iii clinical trials for treatment of prostate cancer with 76 accuracy this suggests that clinical trial data could provide a practical source for machine learningbased tools for precision medicinecitation needed,0
newtonjohn spense and schotte 1994 compared the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy cbt and electromyographic biofeedback emgbiofeedback for 44 participants with chronic low back pain newtonjohn et al 1994 split the participants into two groups then measured the intensity of pain the participants perceived disability and depression before treatment after treatment and again six months later newtonjohn et al1994 found no significant differences between the group which received cbt and the group which received emgbiofeedback this seems to indicate that biofeedback is as effective as cbt in chronic low back pain comparing the results of the groups before treatment and after treatment indicates that emgbiofeedback reduced pain disability and depression as much as by half.,0
a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space on april 29 2013 scientists in rensselaer polytechnic institute funded by nasa reported that during spaceflight on the international space station microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways not observed on earth and in ways that can lead to increases in growth and virulence more recently in 2017 bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the nearweightlessness of space microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space,0
preventive healthcare is a way to avoid an injury sickness or disease in the first place a treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started a treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem but treatments may not produce permanent cures especially in chronic diseases cures are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable pain management also called pain medicine is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain,0
a common method for determining how genes and environment nature and nurture contribute to a phenotype involves studying identical and fraternal twins or other siblings of multiple births identical siblings are genetically the same since they come from the same zygote meanwhile fraternal twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings by comparing how often a certain disorder occurs in a pair of identical twins to how often it occurs in a pair of fraternal twins scientists can determine whether that disorder is caused by genetic or postnatal environmental factors one famous example involved the study of the genain quadruplets who were identical quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia,0
where f displaystyle f is the focal length and d displaystyle d is the diameter of the entrance pupil by convention f is treated as a single symbol and specific values of f are written by replacing the number sign with the value the two ways to increase the fstop are to either decrease the diameter of the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length in the case of a zoom lens this can be done by simply adjusting the lens higher fnumbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly regardless of distance but requires very long exposure times,0
there are also sociopolitical causes of malnutrition for example the population of a community might be at increased risk for malnutrition if government is poor and the area lacks healthrelated services on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels access to land or levels of education community plays a crucial role in addressing the social causes of malnutrition for example communities with high social support and knowledge sharing about social protection programs can enable better public service demands better public service demands and social protection programs minimise the risk of malnutrition in these communities,0
the rhythm is linked to the lightdark cycle animals including humans kept in total darkness for extended periods eventually function with a freerunning rhythm their sleep cycle is pushed back or forward each day depending on whether their day their endogenous period is shorter or longer than 24 hours the environmental cues that reset the rhythms each day are called zeitgebers totally blind subterranean mammals eg blind mole rat spalax sp are able to maintain their endogenous clocks in the apparent absence of external stimuli although they lack imageforming eyes their photoreceptors which detect light are still functional they do surface periodically as wellpage needed,0
one of the most used ehealth applications worldwide is electronic medical records emrs electronic medical records have multiple functions in the medical field some of the functions include but are not limited to documentation communication and management of patient data electronic medical records are the technological replacement for paperbased documentation which is not only laborintensive but also repetitive inaccurate at times and can consume a lot of time electronic health records ehrs are another ehealth application used by physicians however despite the many similarities in both health applications they are not the same the main difference between the two is that ehrs have an additional feature which includes the ability to share the data for multiple authorized physicians,0
trace fossils consist mainly of tracks and burrows but also include coprolites fossil feces and marks left by feeding trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilised hard parts and they reflect organisms behaviours also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals comparable to earthworms,0
menopause is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last menstrual cycle there are a number of symptoms connected to menopause most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life one way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness prior to and during menopause as the female body changes there can be physical physiological or internal changes to the body these changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercise these changes include,0
but if the speed changes a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary one such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval and then taking the sum a riemann sum of the approximate distance traveled in each interval the basic idea is that if only a short time elapses then the speed will stay more or less the same however a riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled we must take the limit of all such riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled,0
most countries place dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of foods not drugs as a result the manufacturer and not the government has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed regulation of supplements varies widely by country in the united states a dietary supplement is defined under the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 there is no fda approval process for dietary supplements and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994 the food and drug administration must rely on its adverse event reporting system to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements,0
nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the goal of the unfccc is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system as stated in the convention this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can be sustained the unfccc does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do global emissions have risen since the unfccc was signed its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations,0
other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium titanium copper and magnesium copper alloys have been known for a long time since the bronze age while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed due to the chemical reactivity of these metals the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently the alloys of aluminium titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength to weight ratios and in the case of magnesium their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding these materials are ideal for situations where high strength to weight ratios are more important than bulk cost such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications,0
some other technologies include assistive technologies rehabilitation robotics and unobtrusive monitoring sensors that can help people with disabilities perform their daily tasks independently computational simulations modeling and machine learning eg fgai4h approaches can model healthrelated outcomes these advanced simulations are able to be repeated replicated and tailored to any research area in medical imaging the applications for this technology helps healthcare professionals visualize genes brain structures and many other components of human anatomy the flexibility in this technology also allows for more positive and accurate results mobile health or mhealth is the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices,0
atmospheric dynamics is the study of motion systems of meteorological importance integrating observations at multiple locations and times and theories common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as thunderstorms tornadoes gravity waves tropical cyclones extratropical cyclones jet streams and globalscale circulations the goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from physics the objectives of such studies incorporate improving weather forecasting developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations and understanding the implications of humaninduced perturbations eg increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer on the global climate,0
by definition phytochemicals include all nutritional and nonnutritional components of edible plants included as nutritional constituents are provitamin a carotenoids whereas those without nutrient status are diverse polyphenols flavonoids resveratrol and lignans that are present in numerous plant foods some phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health however the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties in vivo is that they must first be defined with a dietary reference intake level to enable accurate food labeling a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to provide antioxidant benefits,0
the emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through the convergence of drexlers theoretical and public work which developed and popularized a conceptual framework and experimental advances that drew additional attention to the prospects in the 1980s two breakthroughs helped to spark the growth of nanotechnology first the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 enabled visualization of individual atoms and bonds and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989 the microscopes developers gerd binnig and heinrich rohrer at ibm zurich research laboratory received a nobel prize in physics in 1986 binnig quate and gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year,0
smallpox was the most destructive disease that was brought by europeans to the native americans both in terms of morbidity and mortality the first welldocumented smallpox epidemic in the americas began in hispaniola in late 1518 and soon spread to mexico estimates of mortality range from onequarter to onehalf of the population of central mexico it is estimated that over the 100 years after european arrival in 1492 the indigenous population of the americas dropped from 60 million to only 6 million due to a combination of disease war and famine the majority these deaths are attributed to successive waves of introduced diseases such as smallpox measles and typhoid fever,0
the ms in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs in addition to programs for physicians various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists orthoptists ophthalmic nurses ophthalmic technologists and ophthalmic technicians in this field these programs are being offered notably by the college of ophthalmology and allied vision sciences in lahore and the pakistan institute of community ophthalmology in peshawar subspecialty fellowships also are being offered in the fields of pediatric ophthalmology and vitreoretinal ophthalmology king edward medical university al shifa trust eye hospital rawalpindi and al ibrahim eye hospital karachi also have started a degree program in this field,0
a number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from malabsorption the abnormal absorption of nutrients in the gi tract malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection to enzyme deficiencies such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency it can also arise as a result of other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine this can cause vitamin deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small intestine the small intestine can also be obstructed by a volvulus a loop of intestine that becomes twisted enclosing its attached mesentery this can cause mesenteric ischemia if severe enough,0
"hazard risk and outcome are used in other fields to describe eg environmental damage or damage to equipment however in the context of osh harm generally describes the direct or indirect degradation temporary or permanent of the physical mental or social wellbeing of workers for example repetitively carrying out manual handling of heavy objects is a hazard the outcome could be a musculoskeletal disorder msd or an acute back or joint injury the risk can be expressed numerically eg a 05 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in relative terms (e.g., ""high/medium/low""), or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme (e.g., situation-specific risks).[citation needed]",0
in 1989 the apa revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the federal trade commission the 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between aspirational ethical standards and enforceable ones the apa code was further revised in 2010 to prevent the use of the code to justify violating human rights which was in response to the participation of apa members in interrogations under the administration of united states president george w bush members of the public have a fiveyear window to file ethics complaints about apa members with the apa ethics committee members of the apa have a threeyear window,0
the centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends several primary prevention methods including limiting sun exposure between 10 am and 4 pm when the sun is strongest wearing tighterweave natural cotton clothing widebrim hats and sunglasses as protective covers using sunscreens that protect against both uva and uvb rays and avoiding tanning salons sunscreen should be reapplied after sweating exposure to water through swimming for example or after several hours of sun exposure since skin cancer is very preventable the cdc recommends schoollevel prevention programs including preventive curricula family involvement participation and support from the schools health services and partnership with community state and national agencies and organizations to keep children away from excessive uv radiation exposure,0
about 500 million years ago plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago both from reptilelike lineages mammals around 129 million years ago homininae around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250000 years ago however despite the evolution of these large animals smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the earth with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes,0
measuring children is crucial to identifying malnourishment in 2000 the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc established the international micronutrient malnutrition prevention and control immpact program it tested children for malnutrition by conducting a threedimensional scan using an ipad or a tablet its objective was to help doctors provide more efficient treatments there may be some chance of error when using this method the screening tool for the assessment of malnutrition in paediatrics stampa is another method for the identification and evaluation of malnutrition in young children the assessment tool has fair to medium reliability in the identification of children at risk of malnutrition,0
in the 13th century in medieval europe english bishop robert grosseteste wrote on a wide range of scientific topics and discussed light from four different perspectives an epistemology of light a metaphysics or cosmogony of light an etiology or physics of light and a theology of light basing it on the works of aristotle and platonism grossetestes most famous disciple roger bacon wrote works citing a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works including those of alhazen aristotle avicenna averroes euclid alkindi ptolemy tideus and constantine the african bacon was able to use parts of glass spheres as magnifying glasses to demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from them,0
modern scientific cosmology is widely considered to have begun in 1917 with albert einsteins publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper cosmological considerations of the general theory of relativity although this paper was not widely available outside of germany until the end of world war i general relativity prompted cosmogonists such as willem de sitter karl schwarzschild and arthur eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects physicists began changing the assumption that the universe was static and unchanging in 1922 alexander friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter,0
information about the relative importance of nodes and edges in a graph can be obtained through centrality measures widely used in disciplines like sociology for example eigenvector centrality uses the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix corresponding to a network to determine nodes that tend to be frequently visited formally established measures of centrality are degree centrality closeness centrality betweenness centrality eigenvector centrality subgraph centrality and katz centrality the purpose or objective of analysis generally determines the type of centrality measure to be used for example if one is interested in dynamics on networks or the robustness of a network to nodelink removal often the dynamical importance of a node is the most relevant centrality measure,0
the transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors which compound into more severe errors each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth this rebellionlike scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest where the driving forces of evolution work against the bodys design and enforcement of order once cancer has begun to develop this ongoing process termed clonal evolution drives progression towards more invasive stages clonal evolution leads to intratumour heterogeneity cancer cells with heterogeneous mutations that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment,0
dietary fiber is defined to be plant components that are not broken down by human digestive enzymes in the late 20th century only lignin and some polysaccharides were known to satisfy this definition but in the early 21st century resistant starch and oligosaccharides were included as dietary fiber components the most accepted definition of dietary fiber is all polysaccharides and lignin which are not digested by the endogenous secretion of the human digestive tract currently most animal nutritionists are using either a physiological definition the dietary components resistant to degradation by mammalian enzymes or a chemical definition the sum of nonstarch polysaccharides nsp and lignin,0
alaska has witnessed a steady increase of cases of botulism since 1985 it has more cases of botulism than any other state in the united states of america this is caused by the traditional alaska native practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish fish heads walrus sea lion and whale flippers beaver tails seal oil and birds to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed the risk is exacerbated when a plastic container is used for this purpose instead of the oldfashioned traditional method a grasslined hole as the clostridium botulinum bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the airtight enclosure in plastic,0
during school mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers parents and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics some students studying math may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject this is known as math anxiety or math phobia and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance math anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes social stereotypes and personal traits help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches by interactions with parents and teachers and by tailored treatments for the individual,0
there are also sociopolitical causes of malnutrition for example the population of a community might be at increased risk for malnutrition if government is poor and the area lacks healthrelated services on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels access to land or levels of education community plays a crucial role in addressing the social causes of malnutrition for example communities with high social support and knowledge sharing about social protection programs can enable better public service demands better public service demands and social protection programs minimise the risk of malnutrition in these communities,0
through the use of genomics microarray proteomics tissue array and imaging fmri microct technologies molecularscale information about patients can be easily obtained these socalled molecular biomarkers have proven powerful in disease prognosis such as with cancer the main three areas of cancer prediction fall under cancer recurrence cancer susceptibility and cancer survivability combining molecular scale information with macroscale clinical data such as patients tumor type and other risk factors significantly improves prognosis consequently given the use of molecular biomarkers especially genomics cancer prognosis or prediction has become very effective especially when screening a large population essentially population genomics screening can be used to identify people at risk for disease which can assist in preventative efforts,0
as the development of nanomedicine continues to develop and becomes a potential treatments for diseases regulatory challenges have come to light this section will highlight some of the regulatory considerations and challenges faced by the food and drug administration fda the european medicine agency ema and each manufacturing organization the major challenges that companies are reproducible manufacturing processes scalability availability of appropriate characterization methods safety issues and poor understandings of disease heterogeneity and patient preselection strategies despite these challenges several therapeutic nanomedicine products have been approved by the fda and ema in order to be approved for market these therapies are evaluated for biocompatibility immunotoxicity as well as undergo a preclinical assessment,0
cell signaling or cell communication is important for cell regulation and for cells to process information from the environment and respond accordingly signaling can occur through direct cell contact or endocrine paracrine and autocrine signaling direct cellcell contact is when a receptor on a cell binds a molecule that is attached to the membrane of another cell endocrine signaling occurs through molecules secreted into the bloodstream paracrine signaling uses molecules diffusing between two cells to communicate autocrine is a cell sending a signal to itself by secreting a molecule that binds to a receptor on its surface forms of communication can be through,0
research suggests that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures the most striking differences are observed between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and ones that do not the primary difference appears to be that prelight cultures have more brokenup sleep patterns for example people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the sun sets but then wake up several times throughout the night punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness perhaps lasting several hours during preindustrial europe biphasic bimodal sleeping was considered the norm sleep onset was determined not by a set bedtime but by whether there were things to do,0
in the united states the national organ transplant act of 1984 made organ sales illegal in the united kingdom the human organ transplants act 1989 first made organ sales illegal and has been superseded by the human tissue act 2004 in 2007 two major european conferences recommended against the sale of organs recent development of websites and personal advertisements for organs among listed candidates has raised the stakes when it comes to the selling of organs and have also sparked significant ethical debates over directed donation goodsamaritan donation and the current us organ allocation policy bioethicist jacob m appel has argued that organ solicitation on billboards and the internet may actually increase the overall supply of organs,0
astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences early civilizations dating before 3000 bce such as the sumerians ancient egyptians and the indus valley civilisation had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the sun moon and stars the stars and planets believed to represent gods were often worshipped while the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky which could not explain the positions of the planets,0
this system enabled wireless transmission of ecg from the moving icu van or the patients home to the central station in icu of the department of medicine transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise transmission was also done through telephone lines the ecg output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ecg into high frequency sound at the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ecg with a good gain accuracy the ecg was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500 hz to 2500 hz with 1500 hz at baseline,0
the cyber law in sweden states pictures can be protected as photographic works or as photographic pictures the former requires a higher level of originality the latter protects all types of photographs also the ones taken by amateurs or within medicine or science the protection requires some sort of photographic technique being used which includes digital cameras as well as holograms created by laser technique the difference between the two types of work is the term of protection which amounts to seventy years after the death of the author of a photographic work as opposed to fifty years from the year in which the photographic picture was taken,0
pain assessment in children is often challenging due to limitations in developmental level cognitive ability or their previous pain experiences clinicians must observe physiological and behavioral cues exhibited by the child to make an assessment selfreport if possible is the most accurate measure of pain selfreport pain scales involve younger kids matching their pain intensity to photographs of other childrens faces such as the oucher scale pointing to schematics of faces showing different pain levels or pointing out the location of pain on a body outline questionnaires for older children and adolescents include the varnithompson pediatric pain questionnaire ppq and the childrens comprehensive pain questionnaire they are often utilized for individuals with chronic or persistent pain,0
measuring children is crucial to identifying malnourishment in 2000 the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc established the international micronutrient malnutrition prevention and control immpact program it tested children for malnutrition by conducting a threedimensional scan using an ipad or a tablet its objective was to help doctors provide more efficient treatments there may be some chance of error when using this method the screening tool for the assessment of malnutrition in paediatrics stampa is another method for the identification and evaluation of malnutrition in young children the assessment tool has fair to medium reliability in the identification of children at risk of malnutrition,0
however several of the leading causes of death  or underlying contributors to earlier death  may not be included as preventable causes of death a study concluded that pollution was responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year in 2019 and another study concluded that the global mean loss of life expectancy a measure similar to years of potential life lost from air pollution in 2015 was 29 years substantially more than for example 03 years from all forms of direct violence albeit a significant fraction of the lle is considered to be unavoidable such as pollution from some natural wildfires,0
explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures these impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere volcanic co2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current humancaused co2 emissions volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the industrial revolution,0
many of these diseases are called lifestyle diseases because they develop over time and are related to a persons exercise habits diet whether they smoke and other lifestyle choices a person makes atherosclerosis is the precursor to many of these diseases it is where small atheromatous plaques build up in the walls of medium and large arteries this may eventually grow or rupture to occlude the arteries it is also a risk factor for acute coronary syndromes which are diseases that are characterised by a sudden deficit of oxygenated blood to the heart tissue atherosclerosis is also associated with problems such as aneurysm formation or splitting dissection of arteries,0
moreover we could refer to the privacy issue at all layers of personalized medicine from discovery to treatment one of the leading issues is the consent of the patients to have their information used in genetic testing algorithms primarily ai algorithms the consent of the institution who is providing the data to be used is of prominent concern as well in 2008 the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers on february 19 2015 fda issued a press release titled fda permits marketing of first directtoconsumer genetic carrier test for bloom syndrome,0
salicylatecontaining foods include apples citrus fruits strawberries tomatoes and wine while reactions to chocolate cheese bananas avocado tomato or wine point to amines as the likely food chemical thus exclusion of single foods does not necessarily identify the chemical responsible as several chemicals can be present in a food the patient may be sensitive to multiple food chemicals and reaction more likely to occur when foods containing the triggering substance are eaten in a combined quantity that exceeds the patients sensitivity thresholds people with food sensitivities have different sensitivity thresholds and so more sensitive people will react to much smaller amounts of the substance,0
new food labeling regulations were introduced into the us and europe in 2006 which are said to benefit people with intolerances in general foodallergic consumers were not satisfied with the current labelling practices in the usa food companies propose distinguishing between food allergy and food intolerance and use a mechanismbased ie immunoglobulinemediated acute lifethreatening anaphylaxis that is standardized and measurable and reflects the severity of health risk as the principal inclusion criterion for food allergen labeling symptoms due to or exacerbated by food additives usually involve nonigemediated mechanisms food intolerance and are usually less severe than those induced by food allergy but can include anaphylaxis,0
the heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small loop of the systemic circulation and derives very little from the blood contained within the four chambers the coronary circulation system provides a blood supply to the heart muscle itself the coronary circulation begins near the origin of the aorta by two coronary arteries the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery after nourishing the heart muscle blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium backflow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the thebesian valve the smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers,0
a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervisiono widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in 2014 30 nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by 2015 over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots,0
collected information at different times by different participants or systems could frequently lead to issues of misunderstanding discomparing or disexchanging to design an issuesminor system health care providers realized that certain standards were the basis for sharing information and interoperability however a system lacking standards would be a large impediment to interfere the improvement of corresponding information systems given that the standardization for health informatics depends on the authorities standardization events must be involved with government and the subsequently relevant funding and supports were critical in 2003 the ministry of health released the development layout of national health informatics 20032010 indicating the identification of standardization for health informatics which is combining adoption of international standards and development of national standards,0
however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite,0

the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction,0
longterm active memory is acquired following infection by activation of b and t cells active immunity can also be generated artificially through vaccination the principle behind vaccination also called immunization is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system as well as its inducibility with infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed,0
allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless when immune cells encounter the allergenic protein ige antibodies are produced this is similar to the immune systems reaction to foreign pathogens the ige antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction the harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein ige antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein creating a tag just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear,0
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte representing 50 to 60 of total circulating leukocytes during the acute phase of inflammation neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce an array of chemicals including enzymes complement proteins and cytokines they can also act as scavengers that rid the body of wornout cells and other debris and as antigenpresenting cells apcs that activate the adaptive immune system,0
within the class aves blackcapped chickadees experience an increase in the volume of their hippocampus and strength of neural connections to the hippocampus during fall months these morphological changes within the hippocampus which are related to spatial memory are not limited to birds as they can also be observed in rodents and amphibians in songbirds many song control nuclei in the brain increase in size during mating season among birds changes in brain morphology to influence song patterns frequency and volume are common gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh immunoreactivity or the reception of the hormone is lowered in european starlings exposed to longer periods of light during the day,0
several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task,0
the role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered the causes of the continuous lowlevel extinction events which form the majority of extinctions may be the result of competition between species for limited resources the competitive exclusion principle if one species can outcompete another this could produce species selection with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction the intermittent mass extinctions are also important but instead of acting as a selective force they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors,0
constraint modeling theories concern families of directed graphs related by a partial order in these applications graphs are ordered by specificity meaning that more constrained graphswhich are more specific and thus contain a greater amount of informationare subsumed by those that are more general operations between graphs include evaluating the direction of a subsumption relationship between two graphs if any and computing graph unification the unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph or the computation thereof that is consistent with ie contains all of the information in the inputs if such a graph exists efficient unification algorithms are known,0
in the mid1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics in 1923 the french physicist louis de broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa building on de broglies approach modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925 when the german physicists werner heisenberg max born and pascual jordan developed matrix mechanics and the austrian physicist erwin schrdinger invented wave mechanics born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of schrdingers wave function in july 1926 thus the entire field of quantum physics emerged leading to its wider acceptance at the fifth solvay conference in 1927,0
these sorts of disparities and barriers exist worldwide as well often there are decades of gaps in life expectancy between developing and developed countries for example japan has an average life expectancy that is 36 years greater than that in malawi lowincome countries also tend to have fewer physicians than highincome countries in nigeria and myanmar there are fewer than 4 physicians per 100000 people while norway and switzerland have a ratio that is tenfold higher common barriers worldwide include lack of availability of health services and healthcare providers in the region great physical distance between the home and health service facilities high transportation costs high treatment costs and social norms and stigma toward accessing certain health services,0
the australasian college of health informatics achi is the professional association for health informatics in the asiapacific region it represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and nonclinical professionals working within the health informatics sphere through a commitment to quality standards and ethical practice achi is an academic institutional member of the international medical informatics association imia and a full member of the australian council of professions achi is a sponsor of the ejournal for health informatics an indexed and peerreviewed professional journal achi has also supported the australian health informatics education council ahiec since its founding in 2009,0
a 2017 review found evidence that practice of a mediterranean diet could lead to reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases overall cancer incidence neurodegenerative diseases diabetes and early death a 2018 review showed that practice of the mediterranean diet may improve overall health status such as reduced risk of noninfectious diseases reduced total costs of living and reduced costs for national healthcare a 2016 review found similar weight loss as other diets a 2019 cochrane review found that there is still uncertainty regarding the effects of mediterraneanstyle diet advice on cardiovascular disease occurrence and risk factors in people both with and without existing cardiovascular disease,0
the training of pediatricians varies considerably across the world depending on jurisdiction and university a medical degree course may be either undergraduateentry or graduateentry the former commonly takes five or six years and has been usual in the commonwealth entrants to graduateentry courses as in the us usually lasting four or five years have previously completed a three or fouryear university degree commonly but by no means always in sciences medical graduates hold a degree specific to the country and university in and from which they graduated this degree qualifies that medical practitioner to become licensed or registered under the laws of that particular country and sometimes of several countries subject to requirements for internship or conditional registration,0
theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars pulsars blazars and radio galaxies physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century in the early 1900s the model of the big bang theory was formulated heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation hubbles law and the cosmological abundances of elements space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere in february 2016 it was revealed that the ligo project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous september,0
the academy of nutrition and dietetics consider wellplanned vegetarian and vegan diets appropriate for all stages of the life cycle including pregnancy lactation infancy childhood adolescence older adulthood and for athletes the german society for nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women breastfeeding women babies children and adolescents the position of the canadian pediatric society is that wellplanned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal infant child and adolescent growth it is recommended that attention should be given to nutrient intake particularly protein vitamins b12 and d essential fatty acids iron zinc and calcium,0
manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data,0
the 1977 yale conference on behavioral medicine and a meeting of the national academy of sciences were explicitly aimed at defining and delineating the field in the hopes of helping to guide future research based on deliberations at the yale conference schwartz and weiss proposed the biopsychosocial model emphasizing the new fields interdisciplinary roots and calling for the integration of knowledge and techniques broadly derived from behavioral and biomedical science shortly after pomerleau and brady published a book entitled behavioral medicine theory and practice in which they offered an alternative definition focusing more closely on the particular contribution of the experimental analysis of behavior in shaping the fieldcitation needed,0
program evaluation involves the systematic collection analysis and application of information to answer questions about projects policies and programs particularly about their effectiveness in both the public and private sectors stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding implementing voting for receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effects while program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant how the program could be improved whether the program is worthwhile whether there are better alternatives if there are unintended outcomes and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful,0
ciliary muscles around the lens allow the eyes focus to be adjusted this process is known as accommodation the near point and far point define the nearest and farthest distances from the eye at which an object can be brought into sharp focus for a person with normal vision the far point is located at infinity the near points location depends on how much the muscles can increase the curvature of the lens and how inflexible the lens has become with age optometrists ophthalmologists and opticians usually consider an appropriate near point to be closer than normal reading distanceapproximately 25 cm,0
researchers with the american gut project and human microbiome project found that twelve microbe families varied in abundance based on the race or ethnicity of the individual the strength of these associations is limited by the small sample size the american gut project collected data from 1375 individuals 90 of whom were white the healthy life in an urban setting helius study in amsterdam found that those of dutch ancestry had the highest level of gut microbiota diversity while those of south asian and surinamese descent had the lowest diversity the study results suggested that individuals of the same race or ethnicity have more similar microbiomes than individuals of different racial backgrounds,0
