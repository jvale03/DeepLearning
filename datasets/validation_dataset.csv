"It is an approximation useful in chemistry, but not strictly correct. It is not, in general, obeyed by nuclear reactions, or even in one common medical procedure, PET scanning (positron emission tomography). In this procedure, radioactive variants of common drug or body chemicals are injected into a patient under observation. Some of a particular radioactive chemical element or elements are radioactive in a particular way—they are neutron-light. Their nuclear reactions in the body are similar to beta-decay of neutron-heavy elements, except that the “electrons” released are not electrons, but the corresponding anti-matter: positrons. As anti-matter, positrons are quite unwelcome in ordinary matter—the patient—and very quickly encounter electrons, annihilating each electron-positron pair.";"Human"
"These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter. People at high risk of not getting enough vitamin D, all children aged 1 to 4, and all babies (unless they're having more than 500ml of infant formula a day) should take a daily supplement throughout the year. There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19).";"Human"
"Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and immune function, primarily by regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Humans can synthesize vitamin D through skin exposure to sunlight (UVB rays), but factors like limited sun exposure, darker skin, age, and geographic location can reduce production. The recommended daily intake varies by age and health status. For most adults, 600-800 IU (15-20 µg) per day is sufficient, though some individuals may require higher doses, especially if deficient. Dietary sources include fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and weakened immunity, making adequate vitamin D intake crucial for overall health and well-being. Regular checks can ensure optimal levels.";"AI"
"Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter, early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.";"Human"
"There are an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the known Universe, some will hold millions and others will hold billions of stars. Most of the stars will have various amounts of planets in orbit around them and trillions of those planets will be in the Goldilocks Zone, which is an area in space that has the right conditions for liquid water to exist. So the logical thing you might say is “There must be life on some of them”. Maybe some other intelligent life form on a faraway world is asking that same question. If we are alone that would make us more special and unique than we could ever imagine.";"Human"
"Type 2 diabetes rates have risen dramatically worldwide since the 1980s, constituting a global health crisis. The prevalence has more than doubled over the past three decades, increasing from approximately 108 million adults in 1980 to over 537 million (10.5% of global adult population) by 2021. This surge has been particularly pronounced in middle-income countries experiencing rapid urbanization, with Pacific Islands and Middle Eastern nations showing the highest prevalence rates, while China and India have the largest absolute numbers. Key drivers include rising obesity rates, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, Westernization of diets, aging populations, and improved detection methods. While some high-income countries have shown signs of stabilization recently, global projections remain concerning, with cases expected to reach 783 million by 2045.";"AI"
"Quarks and gluons are both fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, but they have distinct roles. Quarks are the building blocks of matter, combining to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. They come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks have fractional electric charges and interact via the strong nuclear force, which holds them together inside protons and neutrons. Gluons, on the other hand, are force carrier particles responsible for transmitting the strong nuclear force between quarks. Unlike quarks, gluons have no mass and no electric charge, but they do carry a property called color charge, which allows them to bind quarks together through a phenomenon known as color confinement.";"AI"
"Insects as food or edible insects are insect species used for human consumption. Over 2 billion people are estimated to eat insects on a daily basis. Globally, more than 2,000 insect species are considered edible, though far fewer are discussed for industrialized mass production and regionally authorized for use in food. Many insects are highly nutritious, though nutritional content depends on species and other factors such as diet and age. Insects offer a wide variety of flavors and are commonly consumed whole or pulverized for use in dishes and processed food products such as burger patties, pasta, or snacks. Like other foods, there can be risks associated with consuming insects, such as allergic reactions.";"Human"
"Spermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood.";"Human"
"The probability of extraterrestrial life existing remains one of science's great unknowns, with estimates varying widely based on different assumptions and models. While we lack direct evidence of life beyond Earth, several scientific factors inform our understanding: The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, attempts to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy by multiplying several probability factors. However, many of these factors remain highly uncertain. Many astrobiologists consider microbial life likely to exist elsewhere, with estimates ranging from cautious to highly optimistic. The probability of intelligent civilizations remains more speculative, with the Fermi Paradox (questioning why we haven't detected them) suggesting either rarity or communication difficulties.";"AI"
"Insects can be used for food production and are already consumed in many cultures worldwide. They are a nutritious, sustainable, and environmentally friendly protein source. Edible insects such as crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, and black soldier fly larvae are rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals like iron and zinc. Compared to traditional livestock, insect farming requires less land, water, and feed, while producing lower greenhouse gas emissions. Insects can be used in whole form, ground into flours for protein bars, pasta, or baked goods, or processed into animal feed. While cultural barriers exist in some regions, the growing interest in sustainable food sources is driving research and commercial production of edible insects globally.";"AI"
"Diabetes type 1 and type 2 are both chronic conditions affecting blood sugar regulation but have different causes and mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance, where the body still produces insulin but cannot use it effectively. It is more common in adults and is strongly linked to obesity, diet, and lifestyle factors. Type 2 can often be managed with diet, exercise, and medication, while type 1 requires insulin replacement. Both types require careful blood sugar management to prevent complications.";"AI"
"Entomophagy—the practice of consuming insects as food—has deep historical roots in many cultures worldwide, with approximately 2 billion people regularly incorporating insects into their diets. While Western societies have traditionally viewed insects with disgust, growing environmental and food security concerns have sparked renewed interest in this protein source. Nutritionally, edible insects offer impressive benefits. Most species provide complete proteins containing all essential amino acids, often at higher concentrations than conventional meats. Many insects are rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins, while containing healthy fats including omega-3 fatty acids. Cricket flour, for example, contains approximately 60-70% protein by weight, exceeding most plant and animal sources.";"AI"
"Quarks and gluons are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, both essential to our understanding of strong nuclear forces, yet they differ in several key ways. Fundamental Nature Quarks are elementary fermions that serve as the building blocks of hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other composite particles). Six flavors exist: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. In contrast, gluons are gauge bosons that mediate the strong force between quarks, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. Properties Quarks possess fractional electric charges (+2/3 or -1/3), mass, spin-1/2, and color charge. Gluons are massless, have spin-1, carry no electric charge, but uniquely possess both color and anticolor charges.";"AI"
"The global increase in demand for meat and the limited land area available prompt the search for alternative protein sources. Also the sustainability of meat production has been questioned. Edible insects as an alternative protein source for human food and animal feed are interesting in terms of low greenhouse gas emissions, high feed conversion efficiency, low land use, and their ability to transform low value organic side streams into high value protein products. More than 2000 insect species are eaten mainly in tropical regions. The role of edible insects in the livelihoods and nutrition of people in tropical countries is discussed, but this food source is threatened";"Human"
"In 1802, Lamarck published Hydrogéologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe. That year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life.";"Human"
"The feasibility of extraterrestrial life is a subject of intense scientific interest, supported by discoveries in astrobiology, planetary science, and extremophile research. While no direct evidence has been found, several factors suggest its plausibility. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some located in the habitable zone where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery of extremophiles on Earth, thriving in extreme conditions such as deep-sea vents and frozen tundras, suggests that life could also adapt to harsh extraterrestrial environments like those on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus. Additionally, complex organic molecules, the building blocks of life, have been detected in meteorites, comets, and interstellar clouds, indicating that life’s fundamental chemistry is widespread.";"AI"
"More than 1,900 species of edible insects are consumed worldwide. However, this number continues to increase as more studies are carried out on this issue. Most of these known species are collected directly from the natural environment, but available data on the amounts of insects that are ingested worldwide are scarce. In any case, there is agreement that of the hundreds of insect species used as human food worldwide, the most common can be encompassed into four groups: beetles, ants, bees and wasps, grasshoppers and crickets and, finally, moths, caterpillars, and butterflies. According to FAO, the most consumed insects are beetles (Coleoptera, 31%), caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 18%) and bees, wasps and ants (Hymenoptera, 14%).";"Human"
"Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human health, primarily regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption for bone formation and maintenance. The body produces vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight, but it can also be obtained through diet (fatty fish, egg yolks) and supplements. The recommended daily intake is 600-800 IU for most adults, though needs increase with age and limited sun exposure. Deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, muscle weakness, and potentially increased risk of certain chronic diseases. Factors affecting vitamin D status include geographical location, season, skin pigmentation, age, and dietary habits. Regular moderate sun exposure combined with dietary sources provides sufficient vitamin D for most people.";"AI"
"Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a close relationship. The likelihood and severity of type 2 diabetes are closely related to BMI. Obese people have a higher risk of diabetes than healthy weight people, with a threefold increase in risk for overweight people. While it is well known that body fat distribution is an important primary indicator of diabetes risk, the precise mechanism of association is unknown. It is also unknown why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and why not all type 2 diabetics are obese. Also obesity significantly increases your chances of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in your life. When there is an excess of fat, the tissues must process more nutrients.";"Human"
"Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity. As of 2015, there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985. Typically, it begins in middle or older age, although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy. Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500 CE with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight. The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s";"Human"
"Many cross sectional and prospective studies have confirmed the association between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese: more than 85% of people with type 2 diabetes in southeast Scotland in 2005 had a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared) of over 25. Recent evidence indicates that high waist circumference may be an even better indicator than body mass index (BMI) of increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes over a 14 year follow-up period in the nurses' health study was 49 times higher among women whose baseline BMI was >35 than among women whose baseline BMI was <22.";"Human"
"Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are part of the Standard Model of particle physics and are classified as elementary particles, meaning they have no known substructure. Quarks come in six types, or flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. They always exist in groups, held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by particles called gluons. The most common quarks in nature are up and down, which combine to form protons and neutrons. Quarks have fractional electric charges and cannot exist independently outside of bound states due to a phenomenon called color confinement.";"AI"
"In order to determine how much Vitamin D supplement to take, you first need to find out what your current Vitamin D level is. You determine the level of vitamin D by doing a blood test for 25 (OH) vitamin D. That’s 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Most experts agree that a level of 32 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) in the blood is optimal for bone health but no one agrees on what is optimal for immune health, heart health, cancer health and all the other important functions that vitamin D appears to have. Your skin, where vitamin D is made, has a wonderful system for making the right amount, then shutting off further production.";"Human"
"Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, though it does not directly cause the disease. The connection between these conditions is so significant that healthcare professionals have coined the term diabesity to highlight that the majority of individuals with diabetes are obese or overweight demonstrates that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases linearly with rising body mass index. This explains why the worldwide increase in obesity prevalence has led to a corresponding surge in type 2 diabetes cases globally. The relationship works through several mechanisms: excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, affects insulin sensitivity and function. Some individuals with obesity can produce more insulin without overtaxing the pancreasy.";"AI"
"According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single Primorial Particle. Divine Volition, manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.";"Human"
"There were observations of spectral lines. That means there are distinct levels where electrons stay. Classical mechanics does not allow such distinctive levels for electrons to stay. For this new approach is needed. In classical mechanics, energy remains constant. This must be building block. It is my interpretation. Then. he thought that the electrons obey some function distribution which give distinctive levels. This is possible for sin and cos functions. So the electrons should obey sin and cos functions and also obey total energy conservation i.e to start with kinetic energy + potential energy = constant. Potential energy and sin function is not problem, because we know pendulum oscillations. How to modify kinetic energy to give sine function.";"Human"
"Mainstream physicists treat quarks and gluons as real particles. However, the observational evidence disagrees with that conclusion. Whereas electron and protons exist for billions of years, quarks are only observed for less than billionths of a second. Gluons are not observed at all, but are only theorized. When quarks are observed, it is during a collision among protons and/or neutrons in an accelerator. After the collision, the quarks completely disappear and are never observed again. There has never been an observation of a sea of quarks among from which could be used to construct new protons or neutrons. Quarks are nothing more than debris from a collision, much like glass shards are debris from a glass striking a brick wall.";"Human"
"Lavoisier's Law, formally known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, is one of the fundamental principles in chemistry established by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century . The law states that In a closed system, matter is neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions or physical transformations . In simpler terms, the total mass of substances present before a chemical reaction equals the total mass after the reaction, even though the substances may change form. Lavoisier demonstrated this principle through meticulous experiments where he carefully measured the mass of reactants and products. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794), often called the father of modern chemistry, formulated this principle around 1774.";"AI"
"Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations the behavior of quark and gluon propagators is studied in the Landau gauge for momenta from the deep Euclidean to the confinement regime. We find that while at short distances quarks and gluons propagate like free particles, over longer distances, of the order of a fermi, the gluon propagator is greatly enhanced as are the triple-gluon and quark-gluon couplings. These in turn suppress the propagation of massless quarks over long distances to such an extent that they have no physical particle pole, exactly as expected of a confining theory. We study the way the world changes as the number of massless flavors of quark is increased from zero.";"Human"
"In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter the mass of the system must remain constant over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.";"Human"
"The active quest for extra-solar planets has opened a new chapter in the book of the search for extra-terrestrial life. This was already an active field of science with the exploration of the Solar System by means of space probes, which gave rise to a ‘space age’ from 1957 when Sputnik-1, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, was launched. Current technology allows us to land a robotic chemistry laboratory on other Solar System bodies, or return samples to Earth, the latter coming with the advantage of being able to adapt analysis strategies to unexpected findings. Based on our current understanding, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and, if we consider life based on a liquid other than water, Titan are the most promising places.";"Human"
"Aminopropyltransferases transfer aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines. Structural and biochemical studies have been carried out with the human spermidine synthase, which is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor, and the Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase, which prefers putrescine but is more tolerant of other substrates. Comparison of the structures of the human spermidine synthase with both substrates and products with the known structure of T. maritima spermidine synthase complexed to a multisubstrate analogue inhibitor and analysis of the properties of site-directed mutants provide a general mechanistic hypothesis for the aminopropyl transfer reaction. The studies also provide a structural basis for the specificity of the spermidine synthase subclass of the aminopropyltransferase family.";"Human"
"The use of insects for food represents a promising yet complex solution to address the growing need for sustainable food sources. Insects offer several advantages over traditional livestock, including lower resource requirements, such as land, water, and feed, and reduced environmental impact, emitting fewer greenhouse gases. They are rich in protein and essential nutrients, making them a healthy and potentially cost-effective alternative to conventional meat products. However, cultural perceptions and regulatory frameworks present significant barriers. Many Western societies are not accustomed to consuming insects, which may hinder widespread acceptance. Ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of insect-based foods is also crucial. Additionally, developing efficient production and processing methods to scale up insect farming is essential for feasibility.";"AI"
"Spermidine synthase (SpdS) is an enzyme responsible for producing spermidine, a polyamine essential for cell growth and proliferation. It typically exists as a homodimer or monomer, depending on the species, and has a Rossmann-like fold common in nucleotide-binding proteins. The enzyme’s active site binds putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), with key aspartate and glutamate residues facilitating catalysis. During the reaction, SpdS transfers an aminopropyl group from dcSAM to putrescine, forming spermidine and 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). This process plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis, stress response, and DNA stabilization. The enzyme ensures efficient polyamine biosynthesis, which is crucial for cellular function and growth.";"AI"
"The Lavoisier Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, was formulated by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. This law states that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products during a chemical reaction. In simpler terms, matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, it only transforms from one form to another. This fundamental principle revolutionized chemistry, as it emphasized the importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding the fate of matter in reactions. The law laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory and remains a cornerstone of scientific understanding.";"AI"
"Lavoisier was born in 1743 into a wealthy family of lawyers, and initially prepared for a legal career, being awarded a baccalaureate in law in 1763. Antoine Lavoisier played the central role in what has come to be known as the chemical revolution and he was active also in agricultural and fiscal reform as well as technological development. He is credited with establishing that oxygen is an element and water its compound with hydrogen, refining experimental methods in chemistry, reforming chemical nomenclature along systematic lines, defining element operationally, and denying phlogiston a place in chemical explanation. This chapter critically examines the analytical conception of the elements that Lavoisier proposes.";"Human"
"Spermidine synthases are essential enzymes that function as aminopropyltransferases, transferring aminopropyl groups from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to amine acceptors, forming polyamines.

The mechanism follows an SN2 reaction pathway where spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine The human spermidine synthase is highly specific for putrescine as the amine acceptor. Crystal structures have been solved at high resolution, including the putrescine aminopropyltransferase from Thermotoga maritima at 1.5 Å . These structural studies, combined with biochemical analyses of enzymes from various organisms, have provided detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of this important class of enzymes.";"AI"
"Lavoisier’s law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Mass, states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.

It laid the foundation for modern chemistry by establishing that the total mass of reactants in a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of products. This law enabled scientists to develop more accurate chemical equations and understand that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or annihilation. Lavoisier’s law was vital in refuting earlier theories like the phlogiston theory and is key to stoichiometry.";"AI"
"Lamarck's Hydrogéologie (1802) represents a fascinating but often overlooked contribution to early geological thought. While Lamarck is primarily remembered for his evolutionary biology theories, this work showcases his broader scientific vision. In it, he proposed that Earth's features formed through gradual processes over immense time periods—challenging the catastrophist views popular in his era. The text emphasized water's crucial role in shaping landscapes and theorized about atmospheric influences on geological formations. Notably, Lamarck's uniformitarian approach in geology paralleled his biological thinking about gradual change. Though overshadowed by his biological works and contemporaries like Cuvier, Hydrogéologie demonstrates Lamarck's cross-disciplinary thinking and his willingness to challenge scientific orthodoxy across multiple fields.";"AI"
"The possibility of extraterrestrial life is rooted in the abundance of potentially habitable environments and the presence of basic components necessary for life. In our solar system, planets like Mars and moons such as Europa and Enceladus show promise due to evidence of water, a key ingredient for life.

"A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a sophisticated medical imaging technique that reveals how tissues and organs function at the molecular level. Unlike CT or MRI scans that show anatomical structure, PET scans detect metabolic activity by using a radioactive tracer—typically a form of glucose—injected into the bloodstream. This tracer emits positrons that create signals detected by the scanner. Areas with higher metabolic activity, such as rapidly growing cancer cells, absorb more tracer and appear brighter on the resulting 3D images. PET scans are particularly valuable for diagnosing and monitoring cancer, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular conditions. The procedure is painless, typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours, and exposes patients to minimal radiation.";"AI"
"A PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography) is a medical imaging technique that allows doctors to observe the metabolic activity of tissues and organs in the body. It involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer (a substance containing a radioactive atom) into the bloodstream. This tracer is typically a form of glucose that is metabolized by cells. The PET scanner detects the radiation emitted by the tracer, creating detailed images that show how tissues are functioning, rather than just their structure. PET scans are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders (such as Alzheimer’s disease). They are especially useful in identifying abnormal cell activity, which can help detect cancerous tumors.";"AI"
"A PET scan, or Positron Emission Tomography, is a sophisticated imaging technique used in healthcare to visualize the metabolic processes within the body. It involves the injection of a radioactive tracer, often a glucose analog, into the patient. As the tracer interacts with body tissues, it emits positrons, which collide with electrons, resulting in the release of gamma rays. These emissions are detected by the PET scanner, which constructs a detailed image showing the distribution and activity of the tracer within the body. Unlike structural imaging methods such as CT scans or MRIs, a PET scan provides functional information, highlighting areas of high metabolic activity. This makes it particularly valuable in diagnosing and assessing conditions like cancer, heart disease, neurological disorders.";"AI"
"Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s Hydrogéologie (1802) proposed a holistic, steady-state geological model emphasizing uniformitarianism—the idea that gradual processes shape Earth’s surface over immense time. He theorized that continents erode eastward, with debris deposited westward via global currents, causing a slow continental migration. Lamarck integrated living organisms into Earth’s dynamics, arguing their metabolic activity drives the decomposition and recycling of materials, sustaining planetary equilibrium. This vision positioned biology as central to geology, pioneering ecological thinking by linking abiotic and biotic processes. However, his speculative approach—rooted in outdated four-element chemistry—drew criticism from contemporaries like Georges Cuvier and Antoine Lavoisier. Despite its flaws, Hydrogéologie laid groundwork for synthesizing Earth sciences, envisioning a unified “Physique terrestre” (terrestrial physics) combining meteorology, hydrogeology, and biology";"AI"

"The principle of positron emission tomography (PET) is that radiation emitted from a radiopharmaceutical injected intravenously into a patient is registered by external detectors positioned at different orientations. This is a technology that is extremely useful in the detection and treatment of diseases like cancer. However, there is some confusion about how PET works. Before PET was introduced a different type of radiation imaging called SPECT (single-photon emission computerised tomography) was used. This technology was based on the pinhole camera technique whereby a reverse image of an object is obtained by passing the light through a small aperture or pinhole.";"Human"
"With the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) from research laboratories into routine clinical use, it is important to redefine the most appropriate use of each imaging technique.

We will also point out the shortcomings and the important questions to be answered before fully considering PET as a necessary tool in the day-to-day practice of oncology. Although many studies have documented the high accuracy of 18F-FDG PET for the detection and staging of malignant tumours and for the monitoring of therapy results in these patients.";"Human"
"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. PET is a common imaging technique, a medical scintillography technique used in nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical – a radioisotope attached to a drug – is injected into the body as a tracer. When the radiopharmaceutical undergoes beta plus decay, a positron is emitted, and when the positron interacts with an ordinary electron, the two particles annihilate and two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.";"Human"
"The cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.";"Human"
"The cell cycle is the process by which a cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and divides into two daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue repair, and reproduction. The cycle consists of four main phases. In G₁ phase, the cell grows, produces proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. During the S phase, DNA is replicated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy. The G2 phase follows, where the cell continues growing and checks for DNA damage before proceeding to division. Finally, in the M phase, the cell undergoes mitosis, where chromosomes are separated, and cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm splits.";"AI"
"Photons, in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons.";"Human"
"A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It has no mass, no electric charge, and always moves at the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s in a vacuum). Photons carry energy and momentum, which depend on their wavelength or frequency. Higher frequency photons (like X-rays) have more energy, while lower frequency photons (like radio waves) have less. Their energy is given by Planck’s equation:E = h f, where E is energy, h is Planck’s constant, and f is frequency.Photons behave as both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), meaning they can interfere, diffract, and be absorbed/emitted like particles. They are responsible for vision, photosynthesis, solar power, and many quantum phenomena.";"AI"
"According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller plates. These move continuously at a slow pace, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created). During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the theory of plate tectonics.";"Human"
"The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth’s lithosphere is divided into moving plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These movements shape the planet, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation. The theory builds on continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, and is supported by evidence from seafloor spreading, fossil distribution, and geological formations. Plates move apart at divergent boundaries, collide at convergent boundaries, and slide past each other at transform boundaries. Their movement is driven by mantle convection, gravity, and Earth’s rotation, constantly reshaping the surface. This theory is essential for understanding natural disasters and the geological evolution of continents.";"AI"
"Thalidomide is a pharmaceutical drug, first prepared in 1957 in Germany, prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. The drug was discovered to be teratogenic, causing serious genetic damage to early embryonic growth and development, leading to limb deformation in babies. Several proposed mechanisms of teratogenicity involve different biological functions for the (R)- and (S)-thalidomide enantiomers.In the human body, however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism. Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy. Strict regulations and controls have been implemented to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformities.";"Human"
"Thalidomide is a drug that was first developed in the 1950s as a sedative and later prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. However, it caused severe birth defects, including missing or malformed limbs, when taken during pregnancy. The tragedy affected thousands of babies and led to stricter drug regulations worldwide. Despite its harmful past, thalidomide was later found to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Today, it is used under strict controls to treat multiple myeloma, leprosy-related inflammation, and some autoimmune diseases. Due to its risks, it is only prescribed under a controlled program to prevent use during pregnancy. Its history remains a major lesson in pharmaceutical safety.";"AI"
"Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe.Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Kepler had believed in the Copernican model of the Solar System, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit – Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury. His first law reflected this discovery. In 1621, Kepler noted that his third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter. Godefroy Wendelin also made this observation in 1643.";"Human"
"Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are three fundamental principles that describe the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, building on the detailed observations of the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Kepler’s work came at a time when the heliocentric model (Sun-centered solar system) proposed by Copernicus was still controversial. Kepler initially struggled with the Copernican model, but after inheriting Brahe’s precise astronomical data, he was able to make groundbreaking discoveries. Kepler’s first law, the Law of Ellipses, stated that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The second, the Law of Equal Areas, explained that planets sweep out equal areas in equal times.";"AI"
"The basic idea of biological evolution is that populations and species of organisms change over time. Today, when we think of evolution, we are likely to link this idea with one specific person: the British naturalist Charles Darwin. In the 1850s, Darwin wrote an influential and controversial book called On the Origin of Species. In it, he proposed that species evolve (or, as he put it, undergo ""descent with modification""), and that all living things can trace their descent to a common ancestor. Darwin also suggested a mechanism for evolution: natural selection, in which heritable traits that help organisms survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time.";"Human"
"Biological evolution, according to Charles Darwin, refers to the process by which species of organisms change over time through variations in traits that are passed down from one generation to the next. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that individuals within a species show variation in their characteristics. These variations can affect their ability to survive and reproduce in their environment. Those individuals with traits that give them a survival or reproductive advantage are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring, while less advantageous traits are gradually eliminated. Over long periods, this process leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits in the population, resulting in the adaptation of species to their environment.";"AI"
"Stoichiometry rests upon the very basic laws that help to understand it better, i.e., law of conservation of mass, the law of definite proportions (i.e., the law of constant composition), the law of multiple proportions and the law of reciprocal proportions. In general, chemical reactions combine in definite ratios of chemicals. Since chemical reactions can neither create nor destroy matter, nor transmute one element into another, the amount of each element must be the same throughout the overall reaction. For example, the number of atoms of a given element X on the reactant side must equal the number of atoms of that element on the product side, whether or not all of those atoms are actually involved in a reaction.";"Human"
"Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the concept that matter is conserved during a reaction, meaning the quantity of reactants used equals the quantity of products formed. Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the molar ratios between substances, allowing the calculation of how much of each reactant is needed and how much product will be formed. This includes conversions between moles, mass, and volume. Stoichiometric calculations are essential for understanding reaction yields, determining the limiting reactant, and ensuring efficient use of materials in chemical processes.";"AI"
"General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics.";"Human"
"General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is a geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. It provides a unified description of gravity as a property of spacetime, which is a four-dimensional continuum combining space and time. The theory posits that massive objects cause a curvature in spacetime, and this curvature influences the motion of objects, effectively manifesting as gravity. Einstein developed general relativity to address limitations in Newton's law of universal gravitation, particularly in explaining anomalies like the precession of Mercury's orbit. The theory has been extensively tested and confirmed through observations of gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects, and the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields";"AI"
"The recommended number of eggs to consume per week varies depending on several factors, including individual health, dietary preferences, and overall dietary patterns. It's important to note that while eggs are a nutritious food, they are also relatively high in dietary cholesterol. According to general guidelines, including those provided by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, consuming up to seven eggs per week is considered reasonable and can be part of a healthy diet for most people. However, it's important to consider the overall context of your diet, including other sources of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as your individual health goals and any specific dietary restrictions or considerations you may have.";"Human"
"The question of how many eggs one should eat per day is often debated due to concerns about cholesterol and cardiovascular health. Current research suggests that consuming up to three eggs per day can be part of a healthy diet for most people, particularly young, healthy adults. Consuming up to three eggs per day has been shown to increase HDL (good) cholesterol and improve the LDL/HDL ratio, which are favorable changes for cardiovascular health. For most healthy individuals, consuming up to three eggs per day can be beneficial, improving cholesterol profiles and providing essential nutrients without increasing cardiovascular risk. However, individuals with specific health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should consider their overall dietary patterns.";"AI"
"There seems to be some merit to having a single daily glass of red wine, it seems to have something called resveratrol, which acts as an antioxidant and is thought to be good for your heart. Additionally, Italian researchers found that moderate beer drinkers had a 42 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to non-drinkers. For maximum protection, keep your consumption to one pint—at around 5 percent alcohol by volume—a day, the researchers say. Basically, alcohol, in moderation, appears to lower risks of heart and other cardiovascular disease.But this is in moderation, mind you. Just as with everything else, the only difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. A beer a day is good; twelve is not.";"Human"
"No level of alcohol consumption is considered entirely safe for health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), even low levels of alcohol use can increase the risk of certain cancers and other health problems. While some guidelines suggest limits to reduce risks, these guidelines are based on minimizing risk rather than ensuring safety. Recent research indicates that even moderate drinking may increase the risk of chronic diseases and premature death compared to abstaining. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether. Alcohol consumption significantly impacts mental health, often exacerbating existing conditions and contributing to new ones. Alcohol initially acts as a depressant, reducing inhibitions and creating a temporary sense of relaxation or confidence.";"AI"
"There are three major compounds of life: proteins; lipids and carbohydrates. The perception of sweet taste, mainly associated with advantageous food, has had an important evolutionary influence on different physiological regulation mechanisms. During human development, sugar was always luxury. In 1885 Constantin Fahlberg produced the first artificial sweetener, saccharin, and the scientific establishment was surprised by its extreme sweetness. Significant to this discovery was the fact that sweet taste became affordable to poor people. Following the commercial success of artificial sweeteners, a battle between the sugar and sweetener industries began. Saccharin was claimed to be carcinogenic in rats. However, it was later shown that saccharin is neither toxic nor carcinogenic in normal amounts, yet its reputation remains tarnished.";"Human"
"Artificial sweeteners are low- or zero-calorie sugar substitutes used to sweeten foods and beverages without the added calories of sugar. Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia (a natural alternative). They are widely used in diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and diabetic-friendly products. While they provide sweetness without spiking blood sugar levels, they remain controversial. Studies show they are safe in moderation, but concerns exist about potential long-term effects on gut health and metabolism. Some people experience sensitivity to specific sweeteners. Ultimately, artificial sweeteners can be helpful for reducing calorie intake, but their impact varies widely from person to person.";"AI"
"Recent findings on the ecology, etiology and pathology of coral pathogens, host resistance mechanisms, previously unknown disease/syndromes and the global nature of coral reef diseases have increased our concern about the health and future of coral reef communities. Much of what has been discovered in the past 4 years is presented in this special issue. Among the significant findings, the role that various Vibrio species play in coral disease and health, the composition of the ‘normal microbiota’ of corals, and the possible role of viruses in the disease process are important additions to our knowledge. reefs and a major cause of reef deterioration.";"Human"
"Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and vital ecosystems on the planet, supporting millions of marine species and providing essential services like coastal protection and livelihoods for humans. However, their health is rapidly declining due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae they depend on for energy, often leading to mass die-offs. Ocean acidification, driven by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons, further threatening reef stability. The future of coral reefs depends on urgent conservation efforts. Strategies like reducing carbon emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and coral restoration projects (e.g., coral farming) offer hope. Research into resilient coral species and reef rehabilitation techniques is also promising.";"AI"
"Although the earliest life seems to have arisen quite soon in Earth’s history, less than 800 million years after its formation, simple forms continued for 1.6 billion years until the multicellular Francevillian biota developed and quickly died out about 2.1 billion years ago. After that, although multicellular forms were in existence from about 1.7 billion years ago, it was not until the Cambrian ‘explosion’ from 540–500 million years ago that multicellular life expanded and prospered. This is essentially what we know. But fossilisation is rare and early life has resulted in tiny traces difficult to interpret. At present there are believed to be about one trillion species on Earth, less than one per cent of those which have ever lived.";"Human"
"The question of how life appeared on Earth is one of science’s greatest mysteries. While there is no definitive answer, scientists propose various theories based on evidence and hypotheses.VPrimordial Soup Theory: This idea suggests that life began in a ""soup"" of organic molecules in early Earth's oceans. Energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or UV radiation may have triggered chemical reactions, forming basic building blocks of life like amino acids and nucleotides. Experiments like the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment support this theory by showing that organic molecules can form under simulated early Earth conditions. Hydrothermal Vent Hypothesis: Some researchers believe life began near deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where hot, mineral-rich water provided the energy and raw materials for life.";"AI"
"We investigate the problem about the reason for the significant sub-centurial (50-55 and 60-65 yr) and quasi-centurial (120-130 yr) climatic oscillations. The 50-55 and 60-65 yr cycles are clearly detectable in numerous global and regional climatic parameters, i.e. in the temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and World Ocean surface, in the tree rings widths, in the atmosphere concentration of CO2, etc. Searching for analogues of these cycles in the solar activity we study the connections between various types of solar, geophysical and climatic cycles. In this Paper I we analyze time series of residual variations of the Northern Hemisphere (AD 1610-1979) and World Ocean surface (AD 18561995) temperatures in respect to the corresponding regression models ""sunspot activity – temperature"".";"Human"
"Significant climatic oscillations on sub-centurial (50–55 years, 60–65 years) and quasi-centurial (120–130 years) timescales are thought to arise from natural variability in Earth's climate system, driven by a combination of internal processes and external forcing mechanisms. The causes of these oscillations include: Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are large-scale oceanic patterns of variability that operate on multidecadal timescales (50–70 years). These affect global heat distribution, weather patterns, and long-term climate trends. Solar Variability Variations in solar activity, such as the Gleissberg Cycle (~80–120 years), impact Earth's climate. Changes in solar irradiance affect atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation, and surface temperatures.";"AI"
"The COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, but that doesn’t mean the novel coronavirus had originated from China. It may have originated from somewhere else. To determine the origin of an unknown virus requires scientific, meticulous research, instead of random speculation. The source of the virus is a scientific issue and requires a professional investigation. Without evidence supported by data or research, no one can claim where it had originated from. Connecting a virus with a region may cause xenophobic behavior. The pandemic influenza of 2009 originated in North America, but it was not called the “North America flu.” That is why the World Health Organization named the novel coronavirus “COVID-19,” which avoids stigmatizing a particularly region.";"Human"
"The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains uncertain, with two main theories under discussion. The dominant hypothesis suggests a natural origin through zoonotic spillover, where the virus jumped from bats, its likely reservoir, to humans, possibly via an intermediate species such as pangolins. This theory links the early outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live wild animals were sold. Another theory suggests an accidental leak from a laboratory, like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat coronaviruses, though no direct evidence supports this claim. While most scientists favor the natural origin hypothesis, limited data and restricted early access make the exact source of the virus difficult to confirm.";"AI"
